159,28261.txt,P4,JPN,high,"I disagree with the statement that argues most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
I think most people are mislead by few aggressive opinions and blaming advertisements for wrong reasons .

However , I admit that there are some advertisements , especially in food , hotels and restaurants , that try to make false impression on consumers by adding colors or increasing the volume or showing pictures of long time ago .
But in most cases , I think most advertisement are honest about their products .
Especially thanks to the arising public awareness , companies are being more careful to be truthful and honest when communicating to consumers through advertisements .

The main purpose of advertisement is to make people want to consume or buy a product or service .
In order to do that , advertisement focuses on getting attention to draw interest from consumers .
That is why they use famous actors and actresses or flashy visuals or loud and upbeat music .
But that does not have anything to do with making the product or service look better at all .
If a pair of clothes looks better when it 's put on by famous actress in an advertisement than by yourself , it is only your imagination that it looks better in the ad .
These effects make people feel happy or imagine something fun which lead them to think that the product looks good or beautiful .
But it is important to be aware that it is not because they did something to the product .
Advertisements are only adding context to the product to let the people imagine something fun or beautiful and have that imagination relate to the product .
When people watch or see advertisement , they should be aware of this effect to protect themselves from false impression caused by their own imagination .

In addition to that , partly due to regulation , there are advertisements which describe not only the strength and benefit but also risk and weakness associated with the products such as prescription drugs .
It seems contradictory to the main purpose of advertisement but in the end , honest communication should be paid off by trust and loyalty from consumers .
I think the importance of honest communication between company and consumer are being recognized in the corporate world .

` The young generation is trained to serve the community in one way or the other .
This prompts me to strongly disagree with the notion that young people today donot give enough time to helping their communities .
Most of the educational dance dramas , the non government organisations involve the young generation .
They are more energetic and enterprising in solving community problems .

Starting from schooldays itself children are taught to help older people to keep their environment clean .
Many school has even included this as a part of their extra curricular activities .
For instance one of the schools in my locality graded students even on the way they rendered their services to the society .

Further the teenagers and college going students inspite of having a busy schedule and overburden of studies take out time to interact with people living in old age homes , in the nearby villages , in a nearby blind school or in the sweepers colony just next door .
They acquaint themselves with the subtle problems faced by them and guide them to get a solution at their level .

There are many Non Governmental organisations of which the Younger generations form a bulk ( the working force ) like the Sanskar Bharti in India which serves the community through Indian art and culture which is unknown to many here

Contrasting to this I agree that there is a smaller lot of younger generation which has a hedonistic attitude towards life .
But that can not outcast the services given by the greater lot which thinks about the communityu as well .

Thus I conclude that the younger generation is prepared to take the responsibility of Serving the society guide by the motto service before self .

Not only that , one would to getting the knowledge and realize the things that helped one to be successful .

Successful people tend to use there new ideas and hence making them to try new ideas with confidence .
One would be setting new things in their path once they are successful already in the field areas they wanted .
They may be risk in trying the new things but they would be quick enough to pull out the profits out of it .
For example lets take Reliance industry in India which has expanded its busniess in all the areas let it be mobiles , petroleum , etc .
They have tried to put new things for there brand company .
They took risk initially and they are successful in implementing there business right now .

One should be innovative in thinking and would rather try to be successful in new things which they has ever tried before .
Successful person would put his startegies , budget , ideas behind implementing them , how would they be helpful to each and every person in mind before practice it .
As they are already know how to do well they would be trying to simulate the methods they have tried to make it a success to the new things they are trying to emerge .

It would be good practice for succesful person to implement his ideas in new things and would help if they would be any crisis in the thin gthey are already doing well .

As they are already through the different stages that one would be going through when they start new things , successful people would be able to handle the consequences when they are risks attched to it .
May be initially it would take time for a new implemention to gain profits or lower risks but later on it would be fruitful .
They would be visualizing the future of the new thing that they will be going to implement beforehand .
Not but not the least one would be taking the pros and cons of the new things they would be trying .
I think successful people are the one who could afford to take the risk to start a new thing rather than any ordinary person .
In anyway there would be no development ecoomically if one stick to the thing they already done .

I would definitely agree that a successful people should try new things and take risks rather than doing the things they already did well .

10770,1755827.txt,P2,TEL,medium,"In general public there is a preconcieved notion that once people become older they are free from all problems , and responsibilities hence they enjoy their life very much but i do not agree with this idea because , i believe that the older one becomes the responsibilities and problems they need to deal with increases .
For instance take one example of a successful person having irresponsible children .
when he was young he only had to look after his carrer which was successful so he does not bother about other things and can actually enjoy his success , where as once he becomes older he should not only look after himself , infact he has to look after his irresponsible child .
so he has another responsibility and as well as a problem to mend his child ways , so he will not be able to enjoy his life once he becomes older .

another example is that the older people allways have a fear in thier minds that they will die soon or later which would definitely hamper them from enjoying thier life .
another thing is that older people dont have physical strength .
they can not concentrate on a particular thing .

younger people can actually enjoy their life if they organise their life properly because they dont have any responsibilities .
even if they have any responsibilities or problems they have the strength to deal with these .
which comes by virtue of their age .

11172,1831082.txt,P4,ARA,low,"I agree with this sentence , because of alot of reasons The first thing is that advertisement helps show the new products to peaple so they can decide to bye it or not .
For example i was searching for a new tredmil so i can exercise on it and decrease my weight , and i saw one that it is so unexpensive and verry effective .
But when ibought it i found that it needs a lot of personal power to make it work , the thing that idid not recognize from the tv .
In the other hand advertisement does not give the taste of different foods and meals , and just leave it to our imagination w hich makes our mouth watering and that is faraway from the real thing Finaly it make all of our dreams is possible by finding every thing we thought about before , but this is not true becouse we dont have the money and even the warantee for all these things .
In short i beleive that advertisements are a very powereful way to make people bye products and some of them reflect the real thing about the putchases .

2257,390494.txt,P2,ARA,medium,"It apears to be more obvious that young people , especialy childern , enjoy thier life more that older people .
That fact depends on many reasons .
Here are some of them wich i would like to disscus , children have no responsibilty , older preople are wiser , and finaly children have all the time they need and more .

the fact that children have no responsibilities makes them carefree , no careless , but carefree where they can do watever they want and all they have to do is learn form thier mistakes .
learning is the easy part as there are no consiquenses .
As for the older people they have dun all the learning that is required and now all thier actiong have consequenses , and no matter how tough the consequenses are , the adults have to face them and pay for thier mistakes , which they have learned of before .
It is also harder for older people to enjoy their time because they are the ones teaching and taking care of the children that have yet to learn and understand , so while the children have no resposibility but to learn , the adults are responsible for their acitons as well as they are responsible for the children .

It is proven that most of the enjoyable things to do are considered rong and imature .
older people or adults are expected to be more mature that children and therefor they are not alowed or more precisly not expected to do these imature things , which everyone finds more fun .
The children on the other hand are their to prove that the grown ups are more mature , the children do nothing but imature things wich they enjoy , but eventualy they are bownd to learn form the adults , who are more mature , that these enjoyalbe imature acitons are not permited and rong .

While older people start to realise that they have less time , to make something of their lives , than they had , they start to focuse more on their careers and they devote all thier time to thier work and jobs .
Not noticing that they could be spending that time enjoying their presuse time .
Children in that case have nothing to worry about , for they have all their lives ahead of them and they have a lot of time left .
they do not think that they are running out of time so they just simply enjoy life , and not wasiting any of it .

It is clear that children enjoy life more than older people , even though adults could enjoy thier lives almost just as much as children if they want to .
Adults are always spending time teaching children about life , when it 's the children that could teach grown-ups a lot about how to live life and enjoy it completly .

8321,1298011.txt,P6,JPN,medium,"I disagree with the statement .
I think it is more intereting to travel alone or by a relatively small size of the group without a tour guide .
There are two main reasons to support my idea .

First , it is true that to have a tour guide with us are better for the instructions about the sight-seeing place .
However , I prefer to look up into the guide books by myself and imagine how to travel by my own way .
When I traveled Kenya alone , it was really alone and little bit scarely .
I have to speak by myself , look into the book , and communicate by my self .
To tell the truth , that was the most exciting experience that I ever had when travelling .
Because I was alone , I really feel everything from bottom of my heart , and had a peaceful mind to think of many things freely .

Secondly , If there are friends or the people around me , that is fun only with that situation as I can talk a lot with such a people .
However , I will loose my tentions to see carefully around myself .
Also , if the tour guide explaine about the places in detail , I will become more passive to the situation .
How can I remember these sights from heart ?
It is doutful .
Furthermore , I do not want to travel in a noisy large group with only Japanese .
I can share my pleasure for sure , but may annoyed by some noisy , impolite people .
That is the worst thing .

For these reasons , I prefer to travel individually with making intereting plans and see whatever I want to talking with not only friends but also the local peoples a lot .
That will sure to make the voyage intereting and effe

First of all people use car for a lot of purposes : for example the drive their own car to go to work , to reach big stores , to meet friends , and to enjoy theirselves .
As a result they need a trasportation service and in my opinion they prefer a car because it is more confortable than bus and train .
In fact people do n't like to stay very close to others , like they have to do in a bus or a plane ; on the other hand they feel more comfortable inside their car , where they can stay alone or with few other persons .

Next , there are a lot of places that can be reached only by car , for instance big stores that are very far from cities .
Also supermarkets , sport and medical centers , theatres and shops can be very far .
Therefore , it is necessary to own or rent a car in order to go these places .

Finally people usually think that driving a car is very funny : for examle there are a lot of people who drive not only in order to reach a specifical place , but also to enjoy theirselves .
They think that driving a car is pleasant and they can have relax when they are going by car .
In addition they are very interested in car brands , like BMW and Mercedes , and this proves thay the statement is no torue

7526,1163102.txt,P2,TUR,medium,"i am completely agree with the idea that older people enjoy life less than the younger ones do .
actually i reached that idea as i grow up and as i thought about my early and middle childhood .
because while considering my life most of the tome i notice that i was enjoying life more than i do know because of several reasons .

to begin with , the younger you are the less responsibility you have , in my opinion that is the first reason behind the fact that as people get older they enjoy life less .
for instance i am a collage student now and i have lots of tasks to be carried out .
for instance , i have lots of exams to study , lots of homework to do , lost of money to earn for making my life and etc. however when i was younger everything was easier than the present .
my parents were doing most of the tgings for me and lots of time i had to enjoy life .

secondly , i think as people get older there is less things that arouse excitement and enjoyment in people 's life .
again when i have a look at my early years there was much to discover , learn and evetually excite about .
for instance ` which university i will be in the future ' was one of the most important question that made my mind busy and kept me excited about the life .
however as time passed i was the at the university that i desired and worked hard for , however there was nothing to be excited for anymore , everything was so clear that i have n't thought about it again .
i mean that as people discovered new things very a few remain in the rest of the life and that cause people to enjoy life less .

finally , i think as people get older their energy also decreases and that finally causes them to avoid some enjoyable activities .
for instance the concerts , the long trips and bunge jumping , beach parties , rock climbing and so on , become some of the activities which the older people reluctatant to join because of their lack of energy .

9706,1568828.txt,P4,TUR,medium,"An advertisement is the most important subject for selling products .
If the advertisement of your product is very good and interesting than no matter how it seems because the people will keep on buying your product .
I think that the advertisement has to be perfect so that you can sell your product with a good price .

Nowadays , people like to buy things which everyone has .
No matter how they advertise it .
If the product is not the same as they advertise than there is only one possibility is that , you will not buy it never again .

Producers make good products .
The problem is costumers .
If they ca n't advertise it very interesting and amazing however the people will not buy your product .
They will buy the ones which sounds interesting and after if they do n't like it , you will have the change to sell your product .

As an example , you are producing bags .
The quality of the bag is very cheap and bad .
Paris Hilton wore it for advertisement one day .
There is another company which has the same price and with a good quality .
Would you buy the one which Paris Hilton wears or the one you have n't seen anybody wearing it ?
The answer will be the one which Paris Hilton wore and bad quality .
Why ?
Because the advertisement is better than the other one and people never heard about your company .

Last but not least , everybody likes to buy good products but especially the one which is good advertised and look expensive and usefull .
If they are not happy with your product , than you ca n't sell anything to them anymore .

There are several advantages and disadvantages in both having broad knowledge of many academic subjects and specializing in one specific subject .
It is beneficial for students to more chances to get good job if they soecializing one subject , because they konw more about the field relative to future work , thus they are welcome by companies .
The time and energy to every one is equal and limited .
It would be inevitable to distract attention and time , if you want to do well in other subjects .
After all , being equalified to complete future work is the certification that have been almost all companies , just like occupational experence is so important now .

Taking several subjects may mean that your interests are varied and you have more extral abilities after entering the social .
It is obviouse that different subjects have different functions to cultivite the qualites of one person , for example , history could borden your view from the nowtime to the prehistory , and deepen the knowledge about the social as the past and nowadays are so similar .
The art could help you to develop the well-sense of aesecety .

8623,1357725.txt,P5,JPN,low,"I agree with the following statement .
I have two reasons why I agree .
The first reason is because the fuel is getting expensive .
As everybody know , the fuel in the earth which are used in large amount of machines and buildings are getting less .
So the gasolin which provide energy for car is also getting expensive .
Then the people who uses car will stop using car so often , and start to walk or use bus or train .

The second reason why I think the car in use will be fewer , is bacause of the enviroment problems .
The dioxigen which is include in the exaust from the car , is damaging the ozon which is covering the earth .
And it is still been damaged .
To stop damaging it , people have to stop providing dioxigen .
So people will have to stop using car so often .

12085,1997187.txt,P5,TUR,high,"Consdering how rapidly the technology is advancing , I believe that the use of cars will be greatly reduced twenty years from now .

At every passing moment , scientists are coming up with new ideas to make people 's lives easier .
Currently , one of the challenges that await them is the ease of transportation .
For longer distances , the planes are highly efficient means of transportation , but for shorter distances , we are bound to use cars or similar vehicles like buses .

There are already steps taken towards this issue .
The `` Ginger '' , also known as Segway , was invented for people to travel short distances quicker and without hassle .
I am confident that better variations of it will be created in twenty years ' time .
These may include flying vehicles , which can be easily navigated even through streets .

At first , they may not be appealing either due to their prices or due to non-familiarity , but after a period of adaptation , they would be more commonly used and eventually they would replace cars .
This is exactly what happened to horse-ridden vehicles when the first car was introduced at the beginning of the twentieth century .

Moreover , there is an increasing concern for air pollution generated by the excessive use of cars .
People are getting more inclined to use alternative methods of transportation like bicycles .

It is true that some people are not aware the impacts of the pollution generated by cars .
However , they are , too , getting reluctant to drive a car since the oil prices are increasing rapidly , whereas the oil sources are depleting rapidly .
The traditional car will be of no use when there will be no fuel left to run it from twenty to thirty years from now .
There will be vehicles running with alternative energy sources , but I believe that they will not be considered as cars in the traditional sense .

When all of these different factors are brought together , I can say that people will willingly give up using cars one way or the other , reducing the number of cars that are in use in twenty years ' time .

8500,1335002.txt,P8,TEL,high,"Successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know how to do well .
I do agree with the given statement absolutely .
It is the inclination for taking up things that are different from the conventional ways and means of doing things , that set the successful people apart from their plebian fellow beings .
For e.g. had it not been for the Wright Brothers , we would not have known the face of the Aeroplane today .
It is their determination to do something different that made it possible .
They dared to take the plane into the air ...
up and up ...
and their reputation soared even higher .

Successful people tend to take the less trodden path and achieve success at the end of it .
It speaks of their determination and perseverance .
Take for instance , Thomas Alva Edison ..
the inventor of electric bulb .
He failed many a times before he could succeed .
The failures didnt deter him , instead they motivated him to try still harder .

Complacence is not a virtue of successful people .
They try to improve on the things further .
If the invention has stopped with the bicycle , imagine how would the world have been today .
If people are content with what they have , then their is no progress in life .
Some people , people with vision and passion , take upon them the task of doing new things and take risks instead of going along with the routine , and they are the people who stand apart from the commons and become exemplary .

9064,1442539.txt,P3,HIN,high,"I agree with the statement that young people do not spend enough time helping their communities .
I believe from personal observation and experience that social service has much lesser importance amongst the youth of today than what it should ideally be having .
Young people do not seem to think that community service should be an integral part of their lives .

This is unfortunate , because social service has profound impact both on the individual and community levels .
Social service builds personal character , promotes community spirit and develops respondibility in a person .
Hence it is essential for the overall growth and development of the person .
Community service is essential for a functioning society - it promotes the general well-being of the society , encourages responsibility division and delegation and greatly enhances the integration of the community .

One only needs to look around to find examples of youngsters neglecting their societial duties and responsibilities .
They are more busy admiring and aping transient entertainment and fashion icons .
These ` icons ' of today do nothing to instill social responsibility amongst their fans .
A life of hedonism is considered ` cool ' and seems to be the trend to follow for the youngsters .
They do not have enough concern about the welfare of the underprivileged , or the elderly .
They are unaware of pressing issues that their society faces .
Even in my own community - which places immense value on giving respect to elders - I have seen young people ignore the plight of their own parents and grandparents .

It is essential that the reasons for the greatly reducing sense of social responsibility amongst the youth be identified and remedial measures taken .
It should be instilled amongst them that as a part of society people have duties and responsibilities which simply cannot be shirked .
Parents and teachers must take care to instill the values of social service in children from and early age , and must themselves prove to be good role models .
Schools must regularly provide social service and community ethics courses , and atleast a few of them could be made mandatory .

In conclusion , I would like to reitierate the point that the lack of social commitment and responsibility amongst the youth is a trend that is detrimental to both the individual and society .
It is imperative that proper measures be taken to reverse this trend and to make our youth more socially responsible again .

11622,1912950.txt,P4,JPN,medium,"There are many advertisement that is made for many things .
Car , food , toys , companies and etc .
Us regular people who watch these advertisement defenetly grabs our attention making us buy the product or use it .
As my opinion I think products that are advertised do look better than what they really are for many reasons .

Many food commercial makes the product look very tasty juicy and big .
They also add special effects that makes it look even better .
But truth is that its just an average food that people eat .
Many fast food restraunt tries to attract as many costumer as possible inorder to sell more product as much as possible .
In my experience I once went to a restraunt because the commerical looked very good .
As soon as I get there the food looked totally different from the commercial and it did n't taste as good as I thought it would be by watching the ad .

Secondly many adverstisements use celebrities .
Many people are attracted to this because many will think if this celebrity is using this product it must be amazing .
People tends to lured in to this trap .
I also have an similar experience that I faced when I was a little boy .
I loved to play baseball and my favorite baseball player was Mike Piazza .
One day I saw a commercial about him using a bat .
He says that this is the best bat that I 've ever used in mu life .
I chose to buy this bat with out any doubt in my mind .
But i find out that the quality of the bat was very bad .

Lastly , many company use professional to advertise their product .
Many professional advertisers use their words and exageration to catch the customers attention .
Oxy-clean for example was an product that was said that it 'll get rid of every dirt and stains possible .
On commerical they showed that it really do work .
But after you try the product you 'll see that the product does not have the same outcome as on television .

Most product are usually much better than it really is .
Many company try to trick the customers by making exagerations and special effects on the commercials so people will buy their product .
The truth is that its not as good as its on advertisements .
As you can see I agree to the statement because of the reasons above

11093,1818765.txt,P7,TUR,medium,"Shaping of the human thinking style is possible .
There is a fact that people from different countries have different reactions to the facts surrounding them .
This difference arises from the various education types in schools and the families .
There are two ways to teach someting to somebody .

The first one is teaching the reasons , therefore the ideas and concepts .
By this technique the student will be learning what is going on .
There he will have the power for making judgements and forecasts about the stuff learned .
For example , he/she will will be able to fix someting he has learned by means of repairing it , or will be improving that thing .
In two cases what happens is natural .
However , this method seems to be best fit for a fast evolution , has a negative side .
The other side of the madallion is that this process will be extremely time consuming , when we the number of things to be teached increases .

The other side of the madallion is learning by facts .
In this case the the learning curve is steep .
Since the student learns little about the ideas and concepts , he/she will not be able to comment about it in the future .
So this stuff will be prone to degregations .
In addition , the learned stuff will not have a change to improve until the learner is genius .

To sum up , the possible two techniques stated above are like two very different things .
But its maybe the most important thing to be realised that all human beings are different .
As we all have different abilities and unabilities .
The real thing is to decide which process is best for the student being teached .
A genius will learn faster , so load all the data with only facts to him k , he will just ask one thing to get the idea , and invent something .
Choose the right combination for the custom class that you teach .

11790,1940783.txt,P8,DEU,medium,"I agree with the statement mentioned in the question .
There are several arguments for my decision which I try to illustrate in the following essay .
First of all , trying new things and taking risks always contain new chances which would n't be offered to you otherwise .
If you continue what you already know , there wo n't never be the chance to develope .
I want to give an example to demonstrate my thoughts : I 've been living in small town in the south of Germany for 20 years .
I knew nothing about the life in a big city or how people in other parts of Germany behave .
But last year I had to move to Hamburg because of my new job .
Knowing nobody it was a hard beginning in such an enourmous metropole .
Now I can state that my personnel horizont has grown a lot because I made experiences I would have never lived staying at home with my parents .

Furthermore , life would be very annoying without no action or risks .
The most people have to work all the day and for that reason there is n't much time remaining for hobbies .
Why should n't we try something extraordinary or ecxiting in our less free time ?
For example , learning a new instrument or trying bungee jumping ?
As for me , these are the highlights which enriches our lifes because they offer us a short break in our every day life .

The third argument that I want to mention concerns taking risks .
I 'm totally convinced that we ca n't reach a high aim by excluding every risk .
For example if someone gives up his or her safe job in an economy in order to start his or her own business , there will always be the risk that the business can fail and that he or her will lost all the money .
For that reason , it 's necessary to accept the risk and to be conscious of because you will only be able to success if you are n't fear the disadvantages or the risks .

1204,198024.txt,P3,ZHO,medium,"In my opinion , it wo n't be an exaggeration that young people do not spend time on their community .
It is true that young people seldom do things for their community .
The reason is simple .
Young people have other things to do and ; most of all , few young people have the sense of community .

Seldom young people in my country are required to do anythings for their communities .
They are often be told that they have to study hard .
Their reposibility is to focus on their study and their school work is always on the top of priority .
To their `` consederate '' parents , things like helping their communities is taken as an bother to their children .
Even the task is as easy as cleaning the sidewalk around the community , parents will usually choose to finish by themselves rather than getting their chidren involved in .

On the other hand , few of young people nowadays have the sense of community .
They even do n't know who their neighbor are .
How can it possible to ask those indifferent people to pick the garbage scattering in the house next to their house .
They usually think that their will solve the problems in the community because it is adult 's bussiness .
They are seldom be educated to help others .
They claim that they are too young to have opinion and ability to making descions about their community .

I do n't think that it is all the young people 's faults that they pay little attention to their community .
Their parents should also be responsible to this situation .
Our younger shoud be taught to be more earnest to their living environment instead of caring only about themslves .

4764,830739.txt,P4,TUR,medium,"I this growing population and devoloping technology , people show up with more needs every day .
But these needs can easily be displayed in an ostentatious ways like making the product seem much better than they really are .
Even though the consumer already now that the product in not going to be a real solution to their question , they easily can get amased by the showy advertisements .

I believe the best way to sell a product hides under the showy advertisements .
Lets say there are to different componies which are trying to sell their hair loss product .
The X company says that this product is not only going to be the permenant solution but alsothe costumer will be able to see the result in 2 weeks , even though it does not work like that .
On the other hand , the Y company just says that the consumer will easily see the hair lossing problem ending in 3 months , after finishing the first bottle of that hair solution .
Also they add that if the buyer would like to see the permenant answers they have to use 3 bottles .
I believe it is not that hard to decide choosing the product that work for you .

My answer would have been saying yes to the first company and buying their product which they empysize their product under the name of permenant solution .
With that word group they can easily get the buyers attention , because the person who has the hair loss problem dos not want to face with the problem or spend their my on 3 bottles instead of 1 .

As buyers we should not believe every word we hear on commercials .
We should be more picky .

7301,1141699.txt,P1,SPA,medium,"I somewhat disagree with the statement because I believe that although it may be important to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , it is more effective for your future career if you specialize in one specific subject .

For example , in school I learned about many subjects including science , mathematics , drama , music , history , photography , ethic , etc. , which served me as basic knowledge for my day to day live .
After I graduated I decided to study marketing , and I made a bachelor in business administration with a concentration in marketing .
Therefore I had to take finance and accounting clases , additional to the marketing concentration clases .
I was n't as happy with the accounting and finance clases , as I was with the marketing clases , but I believe that it is imortant for me to have at least a general knowledge of other related subjects .
This two courses served me as a supporting base for what I learned in marketing because it 's related .
And `` related '' is the clue word here .
I do n't find its necessary for me to study a little bit of medicine , architecture and politics in the university , just to have a broad knowledge in many subjects .
For me it 's more important to concentrate in subjects related to my major if that 's where I want to work in my future .
That 's why I 'm planning to do now a master degree , to even concentrate more and learn more in the studied before .

Therefore , I conclude that learning about other subjects it 's usefull for your day to day live and general knowledge , but as you get older I believe you should concentrate more in the subject you want to work with .
Specializing in one specific subject makes you a `` pro '' in it , and It is better to be a `` pro '' in a subject than to be a `` mediocre '' in many subjects .

11915,1962239.txt,P7,DEU,high,"Basically , I agree to this statement .
To understand ideas and concepts is more complicated than just learning things by heart , and this is also what academic courses try to teach their students .
Being able to present own ideas is more worth than just re-producing things , like you do if you learn hard facts .
That 's why I think that doing research or developing or understanding ideas and concepts should rewarded higher than simply reproducing thing .
Science could not work without any ` thinking ' , and that is what students at a school or especially at an university are supposed to learn : To get behind the things .
Furthermore , most facts are based upon a concept .
That is an additional reason why understanding or doing science is more worth than just learning something by heart .

On the other hand , it is mandatory to have a huge knowledge about simple facts in certain areas .
You are not a good scientist if you do not have a huge knowledge of facts , and if you think about a lawyer , it is necessary to have both , the important , and seldom used bills in mind ( and these are a lot if you count them ) .
But that does not make you a good lawyer .
You have to combine this knowledge of simple facts with concepts and ideas , and these two things make you a really good lawyer .

In certain areas , it might be enough to have a huge knowledge , and you do n't have to be that great thinking person .
If you think about working in a library , it seems to be more important to have huge knowledge about the books which are in the archive instead of being able to understand complicated concepts or ideas .

If your skills have a focus on just one thing , this will not be a key to success .
To combine these two skills , being able to understand concepts and simply to learn things by heart , is a good mixture and can guarantee for good results in the job , but also in life generally .

For student , it is not very use full to learn onlz facts .
It is not the work of a student , becaus we can find it in books .
Of course a student need to learn some but it is for use it no only for learning it .
If a student try to learn alle facts , he can not , he have to understand it .
A student make some study to improuve his knowleg , and if he onlz learn the fact and he does n't understand it he will be in great trobel when he will be supose to use it , because he will can not use it , but that what he supose to do .

But on the other hand , a student who understand ideas and concepts will be a lot more beter in his work after .
even so that is more dificult to understand than to learn , for exempele if you take a mathematique equation , it will be a lot more dificule to demonstrate it than to learn only the result .
but after you will remamber it for a long time if zou understand it .
and if a student make some study , it is for learn some thing if you just look at a book and try to remember excly like it is writen , you didi n't learn any thing , but if you work to understand ideas then you progres .

10873,1775655.txt,P4,ITA,high,"Today , the television , the so-called TV , is constantly dropping on us bombs of advertisements in an infinite number and often the relation between the product exposed and his real qualities is broken , like in advertisements with diet systems , fantasic lotteries or toys , and all that is done in order to sell the more as possible .

The most clear example of the statement are the advertisements of diet systems : they are exposed like some kind of miracoulous thing that , while we are continuing to live our life , can make us lose a lot of weight without any physical effort , and often they have no effects or collateral effects on the users , attracted by an easy way to improve theirselfs .

Another fake thing are the advertisements where we can easily win something special like a car , a travel or a lot of money by apparently doing something with a less greater importance , like buy some books or a certain number of a determinate object .
Then we can discover that it 's quite impossible for us to win that fantastic thing that we wanted , or that this thing is n't really so great as we can expect .

But the most attacked targets are the children ; thousands of toys or games advertisements are daily transmitted from our television , and they reach directly the imagination of the chlid that is watching them .
Often this toys do on the screen a lots of things that they ca n't really do , and this thing is `` casually '' specified with some very , very little phrases transmitted in a quite invisible way near the border of the television screen , so that a child ca n't read or even notice them .

In conclusion , is absolutly true that a lot of advertisements about products , like these described , makes these products something incredible , unbeliveble , fantastic , and often they are really much worse of what we can see and think but , as a result , they make us lose a lot of money in a useless way .

10841,1768491.txt,P2,HIN,high,"The question whether young people enjoy life more than the older generations .
It is an intriguing question .
as one might feel that the energetic young people , are more likely to have enjoyable experiences compared to the senile old people .
However i completely disagree with the statement and feel that enjoyment in life is not constrained by age .

For one reason i beleive that age has no bearing on the good moments in life is when i see an old person jogging around merrily in the park compared to a young guy suffering from lung disorders , admitted in the hodpital , resulting from smoking .
The younger generation could be sometimes be too careless and headlong in their approach towards life as compared to the old and mature folks .
The young people believe that they should go for everything they feel will give them pleasure and live every moment to the fullest .
In doing that they present an outer picture of joy happiness but it could not be so good afterall .

Ok lets talk about sports , ever wondered about the young players on the field and the older retired players sitting in the commentary box describing every action of the game .
Does n't the game give the same amount of pleasure to both on field , young players and off field old guys who are thrilled and nostalgic of their times .
Can we qantify their enjoyment ? , we cant .
Each of us enjoy in a different way .

The older people have much more experiences and lessons from their life which they can share with their friends and childrens .
I agree an old man cant race his motorbike or overspeed , the popular source of fun for the younger generations , but doesnt an old man enjoy playing with his grandson or teaching him a game of chess , or riding a bicycle .
Cant he reflect upon the achievements of his life and feel contented .
Its a matter of how we take life and cherish its moments .

Finally , Its not about age , enjoyment in life is solely about our approach towards life , For some people life begins at forty .
I have seen so many old aged convivial gourmets who still enjoy tasting the wine and educating the younger people about the various wines .
Its just one simple example which depicts that age doesnt restrict enjoyment .

I ultimately beleive that enjoyment in life transcends the boundaries set by factors like age or health .
Senility could be a period of tremendous fun and enjoyment .
Young or old joy , is knocking our doors , we need to open the door .

11058,1811557.txt,P5,FRA,medium,"Since the end of the nineteen century , the expansion of cars is increased all over the years .
The need to move from a town to another or the pleasure of driving had produced a big market and economic system .
Could you imagine the evolution in a few years ?
What could be the number of cars in twenty years ?
In fact , the real question is if the cars will be fewer or not in the next years .

Firstly , we live in an economic system based a lot on the petroleum industry .
The main energy of cars , today , is the petrol .
Have fewer cars in a few years would say we need to be more independant about this energy and develop other sorts of energy .
The decrease of the number of cars will be possible only with economical changes and also policy reglementation .

Secondly , our road network is sometimes saturated .
I ca n't imagine where we could put the others cars into the traffic jams .
We can imply to build other roads .
But this ca n't be indefinitly .
Now we could in this term have some cars additionaly but in a way , it has to stop a day .

End thirdly , people are more and more sensitive to the environment .
Lot of them go to work in common transports or in bicycle .
People had some cars but do n't use it in the same way than few years ago .
The cost of cars are also a barrer , not only the aquisition but also the training on it .
People do n't want cars or ca n't buy them .

To conclude , I hope that in twenty years , we can breath without carbon and pollution , that 's why I hope that policy and economic system will change and encourage the development of common transports like bus , tramway , metro and so on .
I think also that people are ready to change their cars culture .
In fact it is now the decision of a pollution way or an oxygen way for our planet .

7768,1191927.txt,P8,ARA,high,"Yes , I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take rather than doing what they already know how to do well .
Life is rapidly moving , every thing is changing , life tomorrow will definitely be different from today , the wheel of technology is accelerating , communications have overtaken the stars , industrialization has progressed and every aspect of life is developing faster than anyone thought to be .

Accordingly , our world needs a person who can or even who must meet the demands imposed by it and keep up with the frequent changes taking place .
A peson has to try new things and experiences , they cannot sit aimlessly and say what I have acquired is enough for me .
Suppose a physician that completed his studty in 1980s .
Imagine he has not kept up with the development of medicine and medication since then .
I believe that his patients will not recover as quickly as if they were cured by a doctor who always runs after new inventions and discoveries .
Imagine also an engineer who confines himself in what he had received at school or university .
How should he design a new design that reflects today .
I doubt he will be able to do so .

How can an athlete be successful unless he or she takes risks .
How can we find people like Schumacher , Mohammad Ali , Michael jorddan and so on whose contributions in life are great and without their risk taking life would be tasteless .

Life must go on and go forward , the wheel of progress must run all the time , we need more and more people who open the door wider into new experiences and new adventures , hence new life that is completely different from those whose life is always full of monotony .

8545,1344775.txt,P5,HIN,high,"The given statement that `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' is a disputable topic .
But I would like to disagree with the statement .
This is because I believe that in twenty years from now , there will be an increase in the number of cars used as compared to what we see today .

The most important factor which supports my view is the kind of advancement in technology that we have .
I am sure that with developments in the above feild we will soon have better and improved versions of car models .
With the growing concern in terms of environmental pollution caused by cars , we will have better fuel saving , nature friendly models which will be welcomed by all .
Also it will attract more an more number of people to buy such eco friendly cars .

Another reason why I disagree with the statement is that , I feel cars are much more convinient than other public transport facilities available .
And therefore they serve as a better option for conveyance .
Hence , as man is more convinence oriented , in the future more and more people will be encouraged to buy cars .

Also , now a days people are becoming more and more aware of their status and respect in the society .
And in order to match up with the norms of the society dominated by rich people , they follow what others do .
So this attraction will to buy cars for themselves and therefore contribute to increase in the number .

Finally , i also believe that people are becoming richer day by day .
The class i am discussing is upper middlecalss an d the rich people .
Middle class and otherwise poor people can anyways not afford such a luxury .
So with more and more population having extra money will drive them into looking onto for previliges and luxury .
It is very much possible that different members of the same family will own different cars for their own convenience .

So to sum up , i think that newer ans improved models of cars , their convenience , their status value and extra money with the rich people will ultimately lead to a society with a greater number of cars in use in the coming years .

5681,996657.txt,P6,ARA,high,"Traveling in a group led by a tour guide is always my choice , if it 's possible .
As i experenced both types , traveling with or without a tour guide .
A tour guide has its importance especially in new or dangerous places .
Much to said about the tour guide , simply he or she makes many things more easier and also responsible for manythings that may be time consuming or tiring .
Let 's begin from the first , when a traveler arrives there .
Many world places have no clear maps or directions to get to the hotels .
This makes the traveler exposed to thieves and fraud .
If there is a tour guide , this problem does n't exist .
Also arranging the ransportation to the places of interest with good prices is always tiring and time consuming process .
A tour guide has the enough local experience to get the best for his or her group .
The best time to visit a place or to see something unique always does n't come by good luck but by good experience .
Local customes and traditions are usually hard to learn from books or magazines especially for people who comes from totally different cultures .
A tour guide is very helpful in this point .
Some tourists found themselves involved in legal conflicts or troubles with local residents because they simply do n't know the local habits or traditions .
A tour guide will not expose his or her group to dangers the strangers may not note easily .
While strangers go around in popular markets , they are a chance to some local sellers to sell them false or unworthy articles and this happens more frequentley .
A tour guide can be the advisor about buying local goods .
There is also a human side for accompaning a local tour guide , he or she is as abridge for the two cultures as he or she experience both from his or her natural living and job .
A tour guide can explain manythings that seem unsual , strange , or hard to hard to expalin .

945,156740.txt,P1,HIN,medium,"In today 's world where information is the key factor in any success and the things are so complex that every subject is related to another area , I would agree with the idea that the knowledge of many academic subjects is better .
The communication is the key factor for success today and the successful and effective communications need information on varied topics and different aspects of a subject .
To communicate effectively it is very important to have knowledge on various subjects and multiple aspects related to a subject .
Since the things are so complex and closely related it makes it a neccesity to have knowledge on related subjects even when one is talking about a particular subject .

Another key reason for which I would favor the knowledge on multiple subjects is the fact that this provides multiple opportunities in choosing profession and choosing things one likes .
Until one has information on various subjects the opinions and the likings are biased and are because of the lack of awareness .

The knowledge on various subjects makes things interesting and a person curious which further adds to the knowledge of the person and thus such a person grows its knwoledge continually .

3841,666393.txt,P1,ITA,medium,"In my opinion , nowadays it 's very important to study and to know a specific subject .
Because today we live in a competive world , to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects means to spent a lot of time to study , in meantime a student who sutdy only a specific subject spents only some years at universities and in future , after degree , he has the opportunity to work and to continue his studies in his specific area .
This means to have a hig preparation on a specific subject .
For example in architecture area or in medicine area it 's necessary to study a lot of time to become a good doctor or a architect .
So if we imaginate to create a sutding patway that touchs medicine and architecture in the same time , I think that it 's impossible to have the same quality , about knowledge , of a specific studing adress .
It 's iportant to put in evidence the financial aspect of this model .
To study correctly needs a lot of money , in particular with scientific mattres , and to suggest a multiacademic preparation it 's really expansive for the state , and in particular for the student .
So today we live in really competitive world , every years there are new technical innovations , and it 's important to now a correct use of them .

8728,1377107.txt,P5,DEU,medium,"I will be honest , I never thought about such a topic if there will be fewer cars in use in some years .
I cannot totally agree with this statement because therefore the other possibilities are too bad that so many people will not use their car anymore .
More or less , the only thing here in Germany is the `` Deutsche Bahn '' and a lot of people are not so happy with this company because you never can be sure if your train arrives or not .
In comparison to this , there are a few companies where you can come to work when you like to come and not everyone is able to change the house for the job .

As well , i cannot totally disagree with this statement because there are steps which will offer you better possibilities to get from point A to point B but this have to be cheap In addition , the new trend from people is to live for the nature and future .
Furthermore , it stops the pollution if there are less cars in use and you do not have to spent so much money in oil , gas and security .
Not everybody will be able to pay for a car in a few years .

Because of never thinking about this topic , I was a little bit confused but I think there will be less cars in a few years .
If f.i. the Deutsche Bahn get it und will be more punctual and have special offers that means that it is cheaper than having a car , then it is possible that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years .
In Germany there are more and more offers to get to another place f.i. there is a page in the internet where you put in the date , time and place when you want to go anywhere and there are people who catch you and take you with them to your place for not paying a lot of money .

Using cars has many demerits like traffic jam and car accidents .
Recently I see many car accidents on the news report .
Especially by the drunk drivers .
I think there were be more better invension after twenty years .

Also , recently , the increasing of the carbon dioxide has been a serious problem in the world .
It causes global warming which is very serious .
This causes the ices in the north and the south poles melt .
Then the sea levels increases and many lands will be covered with sea waters .
There are already an island that has been influenced by this problem .
So Japan has been working on to decrese the carbon dioxide such as the Kyoto protocol .
I think the main cause of the increasing of the carbon dioxide is the cars .
The fossils and oils pollutes the air and increases the carbon dioxide .
So I think the best way to solve this problem is to forbid cars .
In twenty years , this problem will be more serious in the Earth .
Many countries will be influenced by this and I think there were be no more solution other than to lessen cars .

From these reasons I think there will fewer cars than today after twenty years .

Through knowledge people can be able to develop the standard of their daily life .
They also be able to improve their social and cultural status among others .
For example , If some one who specializes in energy , but having broad knowledge about other branches of science and cultures could deal with so many matters as the same time .
Also this broad knowledge will help him to communicate with many societies of different cultures .
At the social level a guy with this broad knowledge will find himself having a very sensitive rank in the community for all people will refer to him to have consultancies and advises .

On the other hand a guy confining himself to a single specific specialization with no knowledge in other sciences will be isolated and have limited contributions at social , cultural and economic levels .
For instance if some one specializing in mathemics with no ther knowledge will only make contributions to development of this community through this field .
But if he is asked to contributed to other fields that are needed with aview of developing his community , he fail to do so .

From other perspective having broad knowledge means your are capable to serve you homecountry and your people whenever they need your help and assitance during hard times .

So we should urge all people around the world , in general , and our own people in particlar to make use of their leisure time to have a broad knowledge about different subjects that may contribute in the development of their countries .
For example , if some one 's major is in physician , but his countries is a great need for some one with a background in economics , he will provide unvaluable advise when needed .

Therefore , I strongly recommend and support the multiplicity of specializations for all people with concentrating on one of them .

Also to me it seems borring how the older people live and this is in part for how the TV and the society present us , ( young people ) , how we should live life when we grouw up , no more playing arround and doing fun things but working and working all day to get to your home and only sleep .

From the other side I shuld n't be able to say exactly which of both lifes are better enjoied , because as I said I am still a young person and I do n't know what is to live as an older man and what activities do they have to enjoy themselves because as all the different pars of live there is alwise something to entretain you , for example when you are a baby what you enjoied most was all the little teddy berars , when you are a kid all the toys and little cars made you enjoy life , when tou are a teenager the videogames came to your life to stop your borring aftrenoons and nights and now at my age what I enjoy most and what makes meenjoy life is to hang out with my friends , have some drinks and arrive late home .

As I said previously futher on in life there should be some other things that entretain you in life and not only base it in work , thigs such as real cars , women and even get married and have some kids to form a family and to able to mantain it and see your children grow , and maybe when you are and old man your entratain would be that your sons and grendsons come to visit you and your wife every weekend .

In conclusuon I woul 'd like to say , that is imposible to determine which , young or old people enjoy more life , it all depends in what you do in your life , and simply that ENJOY EVERITHING YOU DO .

Cars is one of the most important thing that people cant live without , without cars people wont be able to go to work or live their life the way they want .
Cars is the main thing that is making life easier these days .
There are many reasons why number of cars will not decrease for the coming years .

One of the most important reason is that cars is the object that help someone go to work and get what the family needs .
First of all , people use cars to go work and do their jobs and get everythin that the family needs also it allows them to do many things they like .

Also one of the most important reasons is that the car helps from moving from place to another .
Many people needs car for going from their house for example to visit their family .
After that cars are made for moving from place to place wheither its far or near .

Finally , these days number of cars increased because amny students are graduating from schools and they close the age of 18 and they apply for the license to have a car .
All people like to drive and mostly teenager .
These days who turns to the age of 18 applies for the license test and later on they get a car .

In conclusion , i dont think that number of cars will decrease no matter what and through the examples i mentioned cars rate will keep on increasing for the coming days and years .

5458,956175.txt,P2,DEU,high,"I disagree with the statement , because I think , that older people enjoy their life more .

The problem is the definition of the word enjoy .
In my opinion is `` enjoy your life '' not , to do everything I could do in the less time a day spend .
Furthermore it is to select the important things , that take you further or let you become more lucky .

Young people sleep only less hours and use the time to make party , do a lot of sport or hang around .
That 's their definition of enjoy life .
The older ones have more experience in their life , because they are older and they also were young .
As they were young they tested everything , too .
And now , they know what kind of sport , cultural living , meetings they need to be lucky .

So they can concentrate themself on the real `` funny side of life '' .

I think , that young people not enjoy life more than older ones do .
I think , they are looking for the right answer , of what is the best thing I could do with my time .

On the other hand , older people normally have more money than younger ones .
So they can affort expensive sports , events or other happenings , which younger ones will never seen in that way .

I heard it a lot of times , that parents and grandparents said , that the greatest , the most amazing gift is a child !

And they enjoy spending time with their family or friends .

How monotonous life would be if we were only to do tasks with prescribed rules to follow .
Sometimes it is a fun and sometims it is a compelsion to devise our own set of rules rather that following the established norm .
A look at the history reveals that almost every man who has make his mark in his field did not followed the footsteps prescribed by others .
Though exceptions are everywhere but the general rule is that that almost every greatmen till date did not believed in following the set pattern and discovered his way to successss by following and doing what he believed was just according to his own thinking process .
Be it Gandhi or Lincon .
Both of them knew law very well and could have gone to become very successful lawyers in their respective countries but instead of that Gandhi experimented with Truth and Non Violence and Lincon with the abolition of Slavery .
He believed in both these principles and was willing and ready to put his life at stake for it .
So was Lincon this reaction towards the inhuman practice of slavery was not taken very well by the dominant forces prevaling in the society of that time .
But Lincon was firm in his belife that the prectice must go .
The success which both these great men achived through their efforts is phenomenal One in term of freedom of India and another in terms of removal of slavery for USA and elsewhere What is common is between these to great and successful men is their wilingness to risk all they had to save the principle in which they believed and that is what classifies ordinary men form successful person All of them have one common feature that they do not compromise of the principle upon which they place reliance and are willing to stake all for it .

4066,706325.txt,P7,FRA,high,"What should one focus on , facts or ideas ?
That question remains one of the trickyest issues of pedagogy .
Some tend to put forwards facts , others ideas and one 's ability to understand and explain ideas .
The problem is not only pedagogical , it is also philosophical .
Both of them facts and ideas are pretty useful to one 's education , yet should one deserve more graces than the other ?

Facts are necessary to the comprehension of any matter .
How could one get the idea of the Roman Empire was without any facts ?
Accordingly , knowledge transmission should not leave facts aside for its appreciation a reality .
An assertion few historians could contradict .

However too many facts tend to be disturbing .
The expert who always focuses on the same facts allows himself one single reality .
His comprehension of the situation cannot be innovative and his behaviour will remain static .
Facts lead to exception .

On the other hand , understanding ideas , can help one understand issues he might not be familiar with .
Understanding the dynamics of the fall of the Roman Empire can help one explaining another situation .
Ideas have a got a plasticity that facts do n't have .

But the notion of idea itself remains quite blur .
For a philosopher , ideas and concepts are facts .
In that letter Heidegger uses this concept whereas in this lectures he did n't .
Why ?
He asks .
That same professor while having spent too much time in the pool of ideas has made it a tank full of facts .
One has to be cautious with ideas as well .

Moreover , ideas tend to lead us to abstraction .
Even though abstraction is attractive , it can end up on dramatic mistakes .
The commitment of several French intellectuals along with communism testifies of it .

Students should therefore be as keen on facts as they should be on ideas .
One does not prevail on the other .
They should be intertwined .

However I sometimes have bad experiences and times by a group tour and a guide .
Therefore I disagree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide for these reasons as follows .

Firstly , the group tour do not fit for me .
Everything such as shightseeing places or food is already decied in a group tour .
Then there are another ploblems .
For example , I have been to Germany in a group tour led by a tour guide .
However it was the worst trip for me .
When I went there , I was only ten years old , but all members of my group were over sixty years old .
Therefore I could not speak anyone .
Also the guide was an English woman , so I did not understand her talking because I am Japanese .
I could not know any English words .
I knew that I could not do freely .

Secondly , I want to research some pleces that I visit to by myself .
In a group tuor , the guid tells me much information such as the name of city or building .
However I want to looking for these things because I love history in the world and the city , tokyo which I live in .
If I travel alone and reaserch many things , I enjoy it very much .
Also I believe that I have the best experiences .

All in all , the trip which is in a group led by a tour guide is not the best .
If I travel with pnly personal people such as my best friends , parents or sisters , it fit for me because I can do everything freely .
Also I can enjoy to know a great number of informationabout tha city Which I go to because my hobby .

Understanding ideas and developing your way of thinking about the facs and analyzing the problem in various ways is the key factor in the sucess of any student while his scholar carrier .
it is the fundamentals only which provides a stronger base to any concept or any derivation of idea , so very first initiative in the student 's mnd should be bary clear about his fundamentals .
After understanding the base one shoul be able to clarify the concepts hiding behind any proble or solution .
The concept is the thing which often many students escapes due to their laziness or their fear for understanding the concepts , because generally it takes time to build your concepts .
students often prefer to learn the facts ang swell then to save time and workship but they dont ever thinks of its after effects in their coming future life , because whenever they wil be using their theoretical knowledge on the practical groung definitely they will be in trouble to summarize their ideas and providing a good soultion to any practical problem .
It is really speaking a art for any learner who is really keen to grasp and going in depth of any concept and proving the thing very clearly .
A student always should be willing to learn something innovative .
And this is possible only when he lear about the concepts and ideas and building their own analyis and tactics .
For any student there shold not be any ken , because he is in a state of learning nothing can be fixed for them to learn only this .
It shows the salubrious nature of any student who is confident about the concepts and ideas .
There are gigantic many sources available for building the concepts and upgrading the ideas .
Student 's sagacious behaviour makes him a well analyzer and its the only thing which hones ones skills and knowledge .
Often some students get intimidate by hearing the questions like ` what concepts you made form this idea ? '
This should not be any more difficulty for the students to sharp their skills and learning ability in their age because its the fundation of any buliding which they are going to build based on those concepts .
If the foundation will not be strong then definitely it is going to collapse .
The ultimately we are in state of realizing the imporatnce of concept buliding and developing your skills .
Only by leaning facts and swelling them one can provide an immediate solution to the problem but definitely all his efforts will be in vain if is not well equipped with the concept building .
When students goes to a practical field of life and they are called for expressing their ideas about anything they studied then at time they will be producing an ineffective demonstartion of their skills .
So if we think in long term then we find that the conceptualising things will be fruitfull and also will provide you self satisfaction .

Finally i'ld like to conclude with the statement ' Pracice makes a man perfect ' and practice is notinh but honing your concepts and abilities .

2802,484918.txt,P7,TEL,medium,"The given statement `` it is more important to understand ideas and consepts than it is for them to learn facts '' on glance it look quite convincing but on closer scrutinity it need a carefull analysis and indepth investigation , I tend to agree with the statement with out undrstanding the topic or idea or consept we can not learn the facts with out proper analysis we can not judge the facts .

For instance a student is suffering with a heart attack and other peer students are collicting the fund for his treatment with out noing the main idea how others will donate fund to the students so understanding the idea is important .

With out nowing the main concept of the idea it will missleads the student , for example a sujar cane factory is going to establish in your town with in a few days a notice has came that there is a esablishment of a factory in your town which has more employment opportunities , then every one fells that it will reduce the unemployment problem in the town and there will be lot of advantages like new facilities will be improved and they asume so on .
But the impact of sugarcane factory will be danger for there health the surrounding of the factory will be polluted with the smell and the air will be polluted , if they know actual concept then the student will oppose to esablishment of factory in the town .

with out understanding the proper idea or concept it will lead for many misunderstandings .
with out understanding the proper idea or concept the student may suffer lot to understand the main theme of the topic .
Not only a student every one should understand the idea and concept than only they can learn the facts

so I conclude in my openion it is important to understand the idea and concept than only we can learn the facts .

Considering the growing passions of young valenteers , however , I strongly desagree with the statement written above .

For the first , there are social advantages which encourage the youngsters to help their communities .
In specific , since participating in local communities can provide the youngs with some neccesary and useful experiences from real world , such as skills needed for processing certain job , taking part in local activities does n't mean only doing bothering tasks for the young valenteers any more .
For instance , I once took part in local festival as an staff .
As there are so many foreigners who visited in my community , all I should do was rushing here and there , giving free interpretation .
Even though it was tough and did't provide me any money , I could more valuable things through that event , Improvement in my English interpretation , and social skills .

On top of that , the youngsters nowadays are tend to dedicate themselves for what they put their values on .
According to the Department of Labor of Korea , in 2005 , more than 60 % of colleage students have experiences of valenteering in their local needs .
What is more , they stated that what they wanted to acquire through their activities was not money but their self improvement .
This case clearly represent the fact that they are now put their values on not only material things but also the mental things .

There is an old Korean saying goes like this ; Helping neighbors is as valuable as helping one 's own siblings .
This represent the idea that giving one 's hand for others need is a kind of qualification to be an well rounded person .
Thus , as long as the importance of cooporations such as giving one 's hand for their comunities exist , the active participation of youngsters will never be limited .

For my personality and fondness , I agree that yonug people spend too less time on concerning their communicaties .
In addition , I will argue over the belife in the following reasons .

First of all , I think that young people spend too much time on their studing and playing .
For example , most of students go to library for researching informations after calss .
In addition , many students go to play baseball and suffer the internet in their free time .
Moreover , some young people prefer do other execise to help their communications .
Furthermore , young people think that it is waste time for helping communicaties .
In a word , few young people willing to helping their communicatiies .

Secondly , young people think that it is not necessary to help their communicatuies .
For example , many young people spend many on buying their toys instead of helping others .
In addition , most of young people think that communicaties is not their best friends or relates , so they do not willing help them .
Moreover , the soical structure has a great change nowdays , few young people has also change thier concept about how to help others .
Furthermore , young people has misleading concept that they do have responbilities to help others .
In short , many young people do not give enough time on thier communications .

In summary , I think that young people do not give enough time to helping their communicaties because they do not realize that helping other is an essential vituer and value for human .
In the end , I will conclude my argument by emphasizing that young people do not understand that the enjoyness and happiness from helping our communities .

12086,1997288.txt,P6,KOR,medium,"Recently , I had a chance to have brief meeting with Tom who just came back from the Europe trip and I was able to hear abou the valuable stories and funny episodes .
However , he strongly mentioned about the lessons given by the trip and also eagerly tries to advise me that without a tour guide tourists are capable of making a trip more interesting and memorizable .
Convinced by Tom , I do not agree with the statement that `` The best way to travle is in a group led by a tour guide '' due to two main reasons .
First of all , by depending on the tour guide , tourists dangerously lose their resposibilities and also deeply become dependent .
For example , let us say there are two babies who have been raised differently .
The first baby , Jimmy has been gifted with a couple who belive that babies must be raised with great care ; on the other hand , the Jeffrey has been raised by believers who desire their babies to bocome less dependable .
Most likely , Jimmy raised with great care will be excessibly so dependent that when he reaches to the time to work in a company , he will have many problems based on the disability to solve problems independently .
However , Jeffrey will be really strong and does give up in society even though adversities try to block him .

Secondly , without the tour guide , the tourists tend to more colaborate each other in a group and naturally make their trip more voluable and memorizable .
LIke I mentioned in the previous paragraph , being independent is really important element for people in society , but also knowing how to work with coworkers is significant .
According to Tom , he said that he had a lot of hard times to find places he and others in the group want to visit .
And he added that because poeple more tend to be collaborative and agreeable , they could have very successful and inerasable trip .

In conclusion , by depending on a tour guide , it will be little valuable trip in the reaons of the high cost for it .
So , if some wants to have wonderful , memorizable trip , he or she have to avoid a tour guide who probably takes his or her independence .

7423,1152916.txt,P7,JPN,medium,"I dare say that I agree the statement that it is more important for students understanding ideas and concepts than lerning facts .
Because ideas and concepts are fundamental value .
They must know these values so that they can apply various setting .
The values help students to extend their knowledge and skills too .

I am a nursing major .
When I was a practitioner , I focused to learn facts .
In this situation , the word `` facts '' means some daily routine activities , such as way to clean wounds or skill of checking blood samples , etc .
But since medical technology is improving and most of the things are done easily with some equipment , I do n't use the techniques in these days .
But we still use our knowledge to analyze the data .
Idea and concepts last long .

Then , if I have unerstanding the concept , I can apply the idea to the diffrent situation .
If I understand the theory that cultural background affect on people 's behavier , I can understand how to care a forein patient .
If students have enough knowledge about fundamental of the area , they can apply it to other situations .
It will help them to solve problems they would face .

Moreover , fundamental knowledge helps students to extend their study .
If a students wish to study in postgraduate course , the basic knowledge of the related theories are required .
If I leaned only daily routine in one ward of one hospital and neglect to study the concept or ideas , I could n't continue my study for the mastral digree .

Therefore , I support the opinion that students should make higher priority to undestand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .
They are basic values which last long , can be applied to different scenes and can be used for brushing up the level of study for students .

5622,986627.txt,P1,DEU,high,"A broad knowledge of many academic subjects surely has many good aspects .
But it also has two major disadvantages : it is limited in quality and quantity .
It is virtually impossible to have a more-than-basic knowledge of very many academic subjects .
And the more subjects there are you know something about , the smaller the amount of information will be that you have about these subjects .
However , a broad basic knowledge of many academic subjects is nevertheless very beneficial .

But such a broad knowledge should not be based on the expense of very specifc and detailed knowledge in a particular academic area .
Our world today is incredibly advanced in all fields of science .
More progression , new discoveries and inventions can only be achieved by specializing in one , or maybe a few , academic subjects .

If everyone had a broad knowledge , everybody would know the same things .
There would n't be any experts with specific knowledge that could be further developed .
Another result of having a detailed knowledge is the ability to work together with people who are specialized in a different branch of science .
That means that some people with specific knowledge can achieve far more than a great number of people holding broad , but only basic , knowledge .

For example , researchers specialized on cellular structers are much more likely to discover unknown details about cells , because they exactly know what is already known , where there are chances for new discoveries .
A researcher who is not specialized in cellular structers might very well discover something new , but it is possible that he doesn'r realize that , because he thinks that it is only new to him , or her .

Another point is that research conducted today investigates very specific and detailed problems .
It is thus impossible to contribute to such kind of research with broad basic knowledge .

I definitely favor specific and detailed knowledge , but I also understand the value and importance of a broad education .
This kind of education is especially vital for teaching in elementary school and possible also high school .
On a university level , however , a specific knowledge is clearly required .

The perfect way of presenting a product better than it really is in this new age of the marketing , where you can buy stuff you see on tv or just online .
Usually what we see on tv , is not worth the price , or what it does but it seems to us as such a good idea , and then again , they make you feel you NEED it , and when you have it the materials they are made of are not good , or it brakes , and all the magic and the wonderful idea goes in the garbage can .

For instance , one of the owner of a Hollywood Studio in the first years of the television , he claimed that people would not spend a time in front of a box every night .
However , in time it has become an inevitable element of one house .
In fact , there are other several technologies that did not take any credit first and , afterwards , they are the important part of our living .
One of them , that I would like to discuss , is the cars that we use everyday for different reasons .
Thus it is not logical to think that they will decrease in use .
As the examples in our daily lives show , their use is constantly increasing due to several reasons .

Today , technology develops regularly and everyday we see different versions of the same car , which is supposed to be just a 2 and half tones of iron compounded by four wheels .
For instance , there different marks in the market .
When it is asked which car you would like to have , there can be various answers to this question ranging from the Mercedes to the Ford .
These new versions and marks encourage people to purchase a newer car even if this person has already one .
In addition to that , with the fast developing technology , the automobiles are produced more and more cheaper .
Hence , the people having a little money spent can go and buy a car with respect to his or her budget .
Indeed , there are consumers credit offered by banks in order to make this process more easier .
As far as all these are concerned , it is possible that in the future , the number of cars will double instead of diminishing .

Apart from the technology in producing automobiles and the bank credits , the governments continously improves the infrasturucture of their countries .
Although their primary concern is to increase the economic transaction wtihin the country and with the other countries , this helps to individualize the transportation .
For instance , in my country , the public transportation is like a torture .
The public buses are full of the people both standing and sitting .
Also , it is not possible to go from one side of the city to other side by taking one bus .
Moreover , the municipality of the city continously improves the roads of the city , rather increasing number of buses and making new combuination of routes .
Consequently , when I see that driving my own car to my destination are relatively better than utilising the buses , I prefer to drive to the place that I wanto to reach .
Thus , today in my city , there is an increase of cars serving for only one person .

As I told it previously , I admit that people who take risks by trying new things can get what they really want and thereafter be very successful .
I mean that if you never try to do something different from what you are used to do at least once in your whole life , it is too bad .
Let 's talk about the actors for instance .
Some of them always act the same kind of characters and that is nice persons or on the contrary a bad person .
This is a good thing for them because they always know how to act since it is always the same thing .
However , some other actors sometimes try to act an opposite character that the one they are used to perform .
Morgan Freeman for instance has often performed nice character in his movies and one day , he accepted to play the '' Nasty '' in the movie called '' Dreamcatcher '' .

If those knowledges were all deepened it would be ideal because people would be totally flexible and they would have a great deal of culture .
On the contrary , others prefer to specialize in a specific subject and know it perfectly well .

Personnally , I think it is very interesting to know many things , to be able to talk about many subjects but I am not sur that it is very efficient on the ground .
I mean that it may be attractive to study several subjects when one is at school but in the end of one 's cursus it is necessary to specialize in one particular subject to know more about it .
For exemple , undergraduate students in business schools study finance , management , marketing ...
and finally they choose a specialisation before getting a job .
That is necessary to be really efficient since the beginning .
On the contrary , someone who will have just studied many subjects without being specialized will have knowledges but not deep knowledges on one particular item .

However , I reckon that it is necessary to have studied many subjects before specialising not only because of flexibility at work but also for one 's own culture .
Indeed , it can be interesting to understand how the other workers do , what is the background of what people see every day .
For instance could be interesting for a mathematic teacher to know geography too or to have basis in economy ...

One encourages the person to have extensive knowledge of his/her academic subject and the other thinks that one should have knowledge of many academic subjects .

Altough knowledge adds much to a persons general culture , specialization would let scientific truths to be turned on .

Broad academic knowledge , would give much to a person because of the ability that knowledge provides to think in different ways .
When a person gets to inforamation in different subjects , his ability of thinking improves .
The reason of this matter is that when a person learns about an academic subject , it is required to learn its logic behind too and the different logic lets the one of thinking in different ways .
In this way having a broad knowledge seems more effiecnt for a person .

Another subject that should be concerned is the general culture that a broad academic knowledge would come with .
This would both let the person to have a better social life and also provide him/her to get a knowledge about a veriety of subjects that he/she is interested in .

Despite the adventages of having a broad knowledhge , specializing on a specific academic subject has an adventage of leting one to know the nearly every information possible .
When a person specializes only on one matter , one could lead to new discoveries and improvements on the subject he or she is studying .
In this way , specializing in one specific subject would let one to go further to the limits of his/her subject .
Itlooks better than to have a broad knowledge because one could give something useful to the society by specializing .

Today , fel costs , which increase at a pace rate , has a negative impact on a family income .
I can handle my personal experience .
My parents , for example , decided to reduce the times they use the car to move , or , at least , they try to combine their different necessities going out together , in order to save fuel .

Moreover , is has been proved that air pollution , due to cars - emissions , is the first cause of breath diseases , even in young people .
To contrast the indiscriminate use of cars , many Italian municipalities , decided to prevent cars from moving in periods when wheather conditions worsen the concentration of dangerous pariculates in the air .
And connected to this , somewhere fees to car entrance in the cities have been introduced .

For all these reason , I am confident that in the following years , an increasing number of people will be more aware of the positive outcome in not using cars and , as a consequence , their sale will be lower .
When the number of cars will be reduced , we all feel healthy ( as bikes will outspread in our cities with no consequences for the environment ) , happy with the money saved we would buy thing more useful and confident that it was the right thing to do .

1127,185589.txt,P4,TEL,high,"The issue under consideration is the argument that most advertisements attempt to project their products in a manner that showcase the products in much better light than they actually are .
This issue appears to be a very common and valid statement , since more often than not , it is a general complaint among customers that products never seem to deliver what they promise in their promotions .
However , I would like to disagree with this statement , keeping in mind my consideration of certain important factors , such as the process that people use to choose certain products , the efforts being made my manufacturers towards developing their products , government , civic and judicial laws that mandate advertisements to give the correct picture , and the role of public interest groups that strive to increase customer awareness regarding the buying of products .

The first point that I would like to highlight is the motivation of customers in buying products .
Many customers do not realize that the products they buy are actually not targetted at them at all in the first place .
For example , people who face hair loss on their scalp tend to buy products like hair loss prevention shampoos , without first checking whether that shampoo is indeed formulated for their problem , which may be occuring due to more serious medical reasons .
When such customers do not get the results they expected , they tend to blame the product , and accuse its advertisement of false campaigning .
To prevent this , customers should become aware of the fact that they need to excercise discretion and perhaps get some medical or non-medical advice ( like in the shampoo 's case ) when choosing products .

The next point I would like to emphasize on is the sincere efforts being made manufacturers of products to provide more information on the intended targets of products , product composition , possible shortcomings or side effects of their products , etc , through easily accessible mass communication channels like the internet and television .
For example , companies issuing public mutual funds do make it a point to issue a warning at the end of their promotion on television , asking viewers to exercise caution and prior research when investing in their funds .

A third very important point to note is the role of government and/or judicial bodies or authorities in passing laws that ensure that advertisements do not make false claims , and allow customers to file suits as applicable , against such companies .
I believe that such laws deter advertisers from hyping up their product .

Finally , any free society has a large number of public interest groups that volunteer to monitor and check wrongful acts such as over-promotion of goods or services in the intent of gaining profit by misguiding customers .
Such societies provide a framework to actively patrol and educate people about such misleading ventures .

In conclusion , I believe , that due to a host of factors , some of which I have detailed above , advertisements of today , though capable , do not actually make deliberate attempts to mislead customers by over-hyping the features of their products .
True , they may use popular celebrities to endorse their brands , or use jazzy visuals and other media , but the actual claims made are largely truthful , and they do make sincere attempts to clarify who their target audience is .

5555,974779.txt,P5,DEU,high,"The statement refers to a very impotant and also problematic question in our modern society as traffic and connected to that environmental pollution increses .
At this point of time in history it is in my oppinion difficult to make such a prognose about the future because technological progress accelerates .
As a consequence we can not know what and more important when a new vehicle will be invented which is able to partially substitue a car .

According to me their will not be fewer cars in twenty years because the present trend of increasing car numbers and traffic does not change its direction .
Cars have been an essential invention in the past and are now an important part of our daily life .
This is shown bz the fact that especially in the industrialized countries nearlz everz family has one or more car .
We use the car to go shopping , to go to work , to go on vacation and often just to visit a friend a few streets away .
With the invention of cars humans mobility increased .
As nowadays a life without a car is hard to imagine and unsubstituable I think also in twenty years this fact will not have changed .

On the one hand cars have simplified many things in our life and increased our mobility , but at the other hand have contributed to many environmental problems such as the emissions of carbon dioxide which damages the oyone lazer and contributes to global warming .
Government has made restrictions and laws to control the use of cars like taxes and there might be stricter laws in the near future but in my opinion it will take more than twenty years for the people to react to such laws .
Even if oil resources become scarce and oil prices will raise an adaption to this will be very slow .
A reduction of car use when oil prices raise will in my opinion only be short term .

As a conclusion you can say that according to me in the near future there will not be fewer cars because cars have become an unsustitutable part of daily life .
As pollution increases the reduction of cars will be necessary to reduce environmental destruction but this will perhaps be achived in in more than twenty years .

Success does n't releave from only one factor .
It often depends on external conditions which one ca n't control .
Anyway , innovation is a good way to approach it , but it regularly must be based on things we know to do well .

Being enterprising and trying new things can be a real advantage for developing a project .
In the economic field , the most successful people are the ones who took risks presenting new idea .
For example , the big boss of apple became a millionnaire developing a small new computer .
Moreover , trying new things makes the technology progress .
The problem is that not anyone is capable of brilliants ideas .
We always think of successful entreprising people , but we should ask ourselves how many people who took risks really got glory .
What about the persons who invest thousands of dollars in projects who turned to be desasters ?
The ideas that collapsed were n't all bad or stupid .
Sometimes a great innovation just do n't come at the good time .
Bright ideas in 1928 were made to failled because of the crisis coming the year after .

I would like to stress another point .
It is not enough to try new things and take risks to find success .
The best way of being able to build a new thing is to be an expert in his discipline .
Continuing doing what we know to do well can lead us to imagine what could be done better , what is missing .

1506,250580.txt,P4,ITA,high,"In the modern economy , characterized by the progressive saturization of the markets in each business area , it becomes more and more strategic for farms the use of advertising through the mass media ( television in particular ) .
But often , in order to stimolate consumers ' desires , advertisements seem to overextimate the real potentiality of products .
That assumption is more than that .
It 's a concrete reality .
In fact in the last decade public institutions had been created to control product advertising and to state if the picture offered by advertisements really reflects the product characteristics .

The creation of such institutions points out that in order to improve the sails of a product , it 's much more important the immage the farm gives to the market of it than its real technical characteristic .
For that reason often consumers prefere buying a well-known product than an un-known one , even if it has much more better technical qualities .

An important example of that phenomenon occured in the car builders sector few yars ago .
Two important groups , Audi on one side and Saab on the other one , decided to improve a project for a new car togheter .
I particular , in order to cut down the costs associated to its production , they shared the same motor and also the same structure of the car .
So the two cars had the same performance as reguard for speed , control and other technical parametres , but were a little bit different in the hestetic ( not too much ) .
Well , even if this two cars were so similar , Audi sold millions of unit more than saab did .
And why did it succede in doing that ?
Only because , thanks to a better comunication and advertisement to the market , it had maden people able to believe in the superiority of its product and in the reliability of Audi brand .

But lots of other examples can be shown in all the business area : products pictured as innovative , sure and unbreakle are only common products that you can buy with ease ( and sometimes at lower price ) from another farm operating in the same area .

Finally , looking at those and lots of other examples , I completely agree with the statement presented and I want you all to meditate on such a misrappresantation .

3419,592946.txt,P4,ARA,high,"Not all that glitters is gold .
A very general statement yet very true .
A statement that should be hung in every company 's marketing and advertising departments , because I think that most of the dvertisments polish up their products .

Evidence to that are the policies that some companies in the United states have concerning the `` refundable , no question asked '' policy .
For example , the famous department store found all across the U.S called Target operates under this policy , giving its customers a three month time span for returning and getting a refund for a purchased product .
Had the product been fairly advertised consumers would be returning less products as they would only purchase a product that they are sure of .

I once watched a five minute advertisment on one of the advertising channels concering a certain product for the complexion .
In the commercial they showed several before and after pictures of people who claimed to have used this product .
It was very clear to me , as it would have been to any computer user , that so much of the picres shown of the after had been altered on the computer .
With the new advancemnets of technology and high developments in the computer manufacture industries something like that can be easily done .
The product was over estimated in price and quality .
I can say that with confidence , for my friend fell for the smell of fake roses and bought the product , the next day she satyed home because she had a horrible rash all over her face .

So it is not surprising that I strongly agree the fact that most advertisments are over done and do not reflect the true value of the product .
As I said earlier , the advertising and marketing departments should be more truthful .

6712,1087972.txt,P7,SPA,medium,"I think education is a combination between the understanding of concepts and the learning of facts .

Concepts are important in the way they are the essence of the knowledge that the teacher needs to transmit to the students .
They are the structure , to built that strong construction that supports all the academic tasks .
Without concepts we will live in a world that does n't worry and take the time to penetrate the deepest parts of the understandiyng and mental capacity .

Sometimes education can turned to square and bored the learners , because everything is about ideas and how to get them .
To pill the onion or to get to the center of the point , we need details , little facts that decorate our lives and the way we learn to see and understand the universe .

Good educators are the ones that can awake their studendts throught a simple fact as a date o a number ( that can be eassily fogotten ) using it as door to walk and search into an unknown universe full of posibilities that let her/him to understand the ideas that once we introduced we never forget .

It is like a game .
When we play to find the treasure we can not forget our objective , but we have to be carefull of the facts and the extra information that we can collect during the search .

9586,1547227.txt,P8,SPA,high,"I completely agree that succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they know how to do well .

First , to succed you need to take risks .
Probably everyone that has succeded in their lives has taken risks .
And when you take a risk it does n't mean that you are going to succed for sure .

When you are going to start a new proyect , when you are going to start running your own buisness or if you are going to take a posdoctoral education for example you are usually entering into an unknown field , in a place wihich you are not familiarized with and where you are going to make probably many mistakes and failing exams .
But that is the only way to succed , trying , making mistakes , and the most important thing , learning from them .

By the contrary , of course you can just do what you already know and do n't want to go further in your knowledgent or education .
There is nothing wrong with that point , but your life and knowledgent are going to be limited only in what you know .
You are not even going to be a specialist in what you think you are good at , because to be a specialist you need to study more , take new exams and take new risks .

Nowdays we live in a very competitive world where you need to know everyday something new and you need to be updating your knowlegment , taking continuing education courses etc .
Probably if you are going to look for a new job the most qualified candidate is the one that is going to be chosen .
The same happens with students : we need to further our education in order to be more competitive to be accepted for example in a college .
And the only way to do that is taking risks everyday .
For studying purposes , we need sometime to retake an exam in order to have a competitive score since all students are very qualified .

In conclussion , taking risks will allow us to be more competent , qualified and succesfull in our lives

Our personal goals focus on ourselves whereas others generation 's goals focused on community .
there may be many reasons why this change came upon us , however , I guess the most important one is related to this our new style of life .
Our way of life push us to worry about personal things rather than global ones .
We care about our personal image , our personal grants and our personal skills .
We have to .
However we must try to change and we ought to realize what it is happening outside and in fact we should give our helping hand .
Anyway , I think young people are no blame of this kind of selfishness but they are unaware .

First of all , we have adquire a new way of life .
We do live comfortable .
Our parents usually provide us everything we need .
Everywhere it seems as if nobody needs anything from us as long .
Our community is rich and everyone can reach a good position as long as this person works .
Thus , our goal is not related to our community in which everything runs `` perfectly well '' but it is focused in ourselves .
Our own complains and artificial needs are highlighted .
We have to be perfect not just good , but perfect .
We have to worry about such things in order to survived in this `` ideal community '' .

Inasmuch as we are so worried about ourselves we are not able to see the problems our community has , we are not aware of that .

Regarding this lack of awareness we can explain why we do not help but we can not avoid trying people realize their selfishness .

We must do more for our community than we are doing up to now .

285,50710.txt,P2,ITA,high,"It is commonly stated the the only part of the human life when you can enjoy yourself is when you are young , and several writers and philosophers wrote about that topics : actually I do n't agree with this statement for two main reasons .

In the first place , asd they feel to have plenty of time , young people usually can waste their time in something that later can reveal as something trivialor not worth doing .
I remember having spent entire days watching tv , alone in my room , rather than going out with my friends for a walk , or to have refused to practicee a sport just because I was too lazy .
Now that I 'm busy and I do n't have spare time , I really feel as I had waste my time .

On the other side , young people have to think seriously about their future , and in many cases , in order to accomplish their objectives , they cannot waste time or money to enjoy life .
For example , if you are studying at University and want to have good results , you have to sacrifice your time to study , or , even if you have plenty of time , you do n't have the money to enjoy yourself .
If you want to marry , you have to save money and this means that you have to sacrifice many pleasures of life .

On the contrary , older people can frrely enjoy their life : at the present time , while I 'm busy studying in order to enter in my PHD program , my parents are travelling around the world with their friends and enjoying their hobbies .

I think they are really enjoying their life , not only beacuse they have gained , after years of sacrifices , the time and money to do it , but also because they have the capacity to recognize the things that the really can make their life pleasant and worth being lived .
Consequently , they are able to place everything the right dimension .
I think it is possible to gain this capacity only with experienceand in some way , both young people wasting time and young peolple sacrifying themselves for the future can later become able to fully enjoy the life .

2150,370830.txt,P4,FRA,medium,"Advertisement has become a whole part of the selling product process thanks to the expansion of the media such as television , newspapers , radio .
It consists in boasting the qualities of a product , and emphasizing on them .
But most of the time , the product does n't look like the one presented on television , or in the newspapers .
It looks much better in the advertisement than it really is .

Indeed , for example in the case of a television advertisement , means such as light , special effects , different angles of shooting can be used to make the product looks better , and thus more appealing to the buyer .
An advertisement for food will be shot so that the product will look apetizing , but in reality , the product the buyer will find at the supermarket wo n't even look edible .
Sometimes advertising for frozen food , will even use fresh food , instead of the real product that is trying to be sold .
And the buyer is often deluded into thinking the image presented in the advertisement was representing the real product .
How many times did people complain about the difference between the brochure and the product , or the difference between the one seen on television and the one standing in front of them ?

Televised advertisement can also hire people to talk about how the product has changed effectively their life , or how adequate and convenient it has been to them .
But this kind of advertisement is dishonest as it lies to consummers .
They want by any means sell their products to buyers by building a fake image product , and making it seems much better than they really are but it is not the way they should sell their products .

I am agree with the above statement because of the following reasons .

For getting job , surviving in society you need to know lot of things .
Every where you are using lot of concepts .
For example take soft ware engineer .

He need to know computer scince , mathematics , english , business logic .
If he dont know one of the above , he ca n't grow in that job .
Nowadays the gap between any two academic subjects is going down .
we are using lot of subjects for understanding single subject .
Consider the example mathematics .
Recent days for understading mathematics , we need physics , chemistry and some other topics .
Similarly we are using mathematics for solving lot of problems in phycics , chemistry , space related problems .

Similarly every subject used for understanding other subjects .
If you have knowledge in single subject , we ca n't under stand recent mathematics .

In reasearch , scintists are using lot of concepts for finding one application .
For understanding recent research papers single subject knowledge is not sufficiant .
Take an expamle space programme .
In space programme we are using mathematics , statistics , physics , aeronautics etc ...

The reasons that I agree with it are that they can change the color of products to look better and they hide the bad points of their products .

First , when the companies advertise their products , they always monitoring and editing the advertisements to make them nice .
They also design the advertisements so that the products colors and shapes look better .
However , if we see the goods in stores without fancy effects , they are less attractive than in advertisement .
For example , in i-pod advertisement , they use fancy colors to make it cool , but it is just computer graphic .

Second , the companies know that what are the bad points of their products , so they hide it .
In television , we ca n't figure out if they do n't show to us .
We can do to the store and figure out that what is error of the products but still we can miss it .
For example , some food restaurants put some chemical material , but they do n't tell the people that they put bad portions in foods .
They always say these are chuicy and jucy , not fatty or harmful .

Thus , many companies make their goods look great to make money .
They want to hire the person like as advertisements designer in order to make their products fancy .
They also want creative person to create new strateges of their business .

7289,1140382.txt,P5,ITA,high,"I will explain why I disagree with the statement that in twenty years from now there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

To start with as time goes by more cars are being produced and sold allover the world .
This trend can be attributed to different factors , such as the world 's population growth or the lower cost of vehicles that leads to higher affordability for the demand .

The population keeps growing as I mentioned and for this reason more people are willing to buy cars .
Also , as also mentioned above , low cost of production given by modern technologies and new materials allows more people to buy a car .

Another reason that makes more people willing to get a car is given by the improvement of the transportation system pretty much allover the world .
We see big highways and roads being built every day so that more places in the world become better connected to each other .

There are many countries , such as Italy for example , where the public transports system is not fully developed , for this reason a growing number of people prefers to have its own car rather than to rely on a way to travel that is not as efficient .

A psychological reason also explains why more cars will be seen in twenty years from now than today ; the society tends to be very individualistic and less social than it used to be .
For this reason more people prefer to be independente when they get around and the car becomes their own shell .

Cars can not be replaced simply because people need them to go to work , to travel , to see places in complete freedom ; sometimes peole just want to get the pleasure of driving them and feel a sort of freedom .

Because of all the above reasons I believe more cars will be produced and sold in the future , therefore in twenty years from now we will see more cars than today , not fewer .

The ads promotes the products with all those qualities which may not present .
Some time they make the image of the product as it has all super qualities and it is the ultimate solution of all your problems , for example the hair care products .
Now a days a lot people are suffering with the hair problems and the companies are promoting the products that it is over night wonder and you will be changed person in 2 days or 14 days or so .
But is it really true ??
People are just going on the marketing stunts and they buy it with out knowing what are the consequences and side effects of the product .
I know some people who have used these dyes and other hair products and now they are suffering with skin problems , which are developed coz of chemicals present in these products .

Similarly the advertisement companies which are promoting the food products .
They also ignnore some concrete facts about the ingredients of the product or the quality of product .
Recently this truth has been accepted by the Mac Donalds that they are using animal fats in preperation of so called veggy burger .
Also , I would like to mention aboout the recent fact that just two days back a big bread company in England has been accused of not maintaining the standard and quality of food as some glass pieces and hair are found in bread packets .

Thus the consumers should not just believe on the ads as they are for the benefits of the company not for the consumers .
But I would not keep all ads like the promotional ad campaigns run by government and some NGO and societies like WWF , WHO , etc. in to this category .
Their ads are genuine and are purpose fully made for the benefit of society and noble cause .
These promotional ads should be supported and publicisize .

On the one hand , one could say young people enjoy life more than older people do .
They still have their lives ahead of them and , due to their youthfulness and good health , are still in the position to aspire a bright future as well as to have all the possibilities to live their dreams and achieve their goals and what they may want in life .
Also , the chances that young people are impaired physically and/or psychologically are way lesser than they are with older people .

On the other hand , one could also claim the opposite and say that due to their experience , older people are more in the position to enjoy their life to the fullest , despite mental or health problems .
After a life full of experiences and adventures , older people know what to acknowledge about life and not to take everything for granted - they will know who and what is important to them .

To conclude , I believe that one cannot find a final answer to our initial question , as it is merely impossible to measure joy or better a person 's capacity to enjoy life .
A young person can also be pysically and/or psychologically impaired in the same way an older person can be absolutley healthy and fit despite their old age .
In addition , some young people have already gone through a lot of hardships despite their youth , while some old people have never faced a severe problem .

Whatever the case , I believe it is not so much a question of whether a person is young or old , but rather a question of peoples individual character , outlook and attitude that enables them to live and enjoy life to the fullest .

No doubt , it is one of our major problem we have to solve .
We must help the people in Africa to show them there is an other life than starvation .

On the other hand we have people that understand success only for their own benefit .
They do things , taking risk just to have their own soul in a good mood .
And no matter what , they going to try as hard as they can to achive their goals even if they take other peoples chances and luck .
Let 's say , that today 's `` bad guy '' are these guys .

Personally , I think , someone who wants to be successful must have a little bit of both sides .
I just can relate from myself .
As a former Tennis Professional I was - and maybe still am - an egoist .
Starting with tennis I had no choice but to focus on myself and win against my oponent .
There is no help from a team mate or a coach during the matches , it is only you .
This fact made me somehow an egoist .
But it does not mean that I have not learn to think about the others around me .
I trz hard to do both ways .

However , I had to take risk to achive my goals even if everybody around was laughing at me .
On that way , I fully agree with the statement .
Because floating with the mass is not a way to achieve something .
Fighting against the mass is the way to become successful .
Most people are successful if they to something special , somthing noone has done before .
If everybody does the same it is hard to outreach the mass , because so many are doing exact the same thing .

So , the only way to be successful is , to take risk .

Having more knowledge subjects can make people more intrested to talk about differnt subjects in his life .
A peson who is specialized in one specific subject is stuck in many things in his life .
While the person with many knowledged acadmic subjects xan access many different jobs and aplication and will have experience than than the person with one specfice subject .
Having more broad knowledged academic subjects makes apersons life much easier .

In my opnion I agree that having many knowledged academic subject is more better than having one specific subject .
A person with a little specified subject will find it very hard to find jobs and it will be very hard for him to mange his life and to do many things in his life .
But having more than one spefied academic subject makes your life much easier and it makes you experince your life better and also he can find more than job and application to work in not only that but large companies are going to send him an invitation to in the company itself .
And one of the achivment a prson with abroadr knwoledge academic subects can achive is being experienced in many things .

my answer will be no .

there are may types of transportation such as buses , trains and arioplanes .
if all starts using the car there will be lot of problems that are created .
the use of cars by all may cause trafficjams and conjestions on the roads .
it also may increase the sound and air pollution .
some travelling in a car may badly injured in an accident and may feel tired travelling lot of distances to the offices .

in the coming twenty years ther will be fewer car visible on the roads because the improvement in the public transportation may provide trains , buses and aeroplanes in large numbers for covering all the places by maintaining right time .
now a days in trains all the facilitites such as cafeterias and for working purposes sockets which can be used for the laptop are arranged and also one can relax by sitting in comfortably enjoying natures beauty .

the public transportations are really safer than that of the cars because one has be alert while driving a car where as in the trains drivers are so skilled .
we can really enjoy a trip in the buses and trains than in a car .

the improved technology may help people to travel much faster than that of a car .
like wise there will be no traffic conjestions in the train routes .
the improved technology may reduce the number of cars that we see now adays .

3874,671215.txt,P1,ZHO,medium,"For the development of the world and individuals , broad knowledge and specific knowledge are both important .
However , as far as I concerned , I agree with it is better to have broad knowledge than to specialize in one specific subjuect for reasons as following .

First , you can make sure that what you interest in only after you learn broad knowledge .
When you know nothing about something , you do not know if you like or dislike it .
So if learning some about the all aspects of knowledge , you can know which aspect you interest in and you can choose the area you will specialize in .
This is one of the reasons that why universities arrange many various courses for students to expect them to find their real interest and then prepare for work or further study in the future .

Second , broad knowledge of many academic syjects is the basis of specializing in one specific subject .
For example , a biologist must have the knowledge of chemistry , math and so forth .
Without any knowlege of other fields , he can not deepen and broaden the research in one specific field and may confront with many difficulties .
With the help of broad knowledge , you can think more efficiently and creat some good ideas .

In addition , the more developed the world is , the complicated the knowledge is .
As a result , if you want to reach some accomplishment , you should have comprehensive ability of many aspects .
If you only have knowledge of one specific field , you may face many difficulties to handle problems in your work and life .

In a conclusion , broad knowledge can estabish a good basis for your work or study in one specific subject .
You can find your interest and development in learning broad knowledge .

All facts were started as an ideas , concepts , hypothesis and theories then after many researches and studies they become facts .

incontrast , many facts and things that we belive that they are true , they become questionable and adoubtable .

Although some people might say that young people thesedays are too selfish to even care about their communities that they are belong to , I am strongly convinced that people at young age still have minds to help communities in terms of their reasonable thinking and enthsiastic attitude .

Firstly , young people are reasonable and mature enough to judge whether something that they are going to do is worthy doing or not .
Therefore , if they think that helping communities are beneficial for both themselves and communities they will definitely do things like working a part time job for the communities .
For example , through woking as a part time job in some kinds of organisms that support the poor and handicapped , they can show their concerns on the communities and help them .
Also , they can experience of working of a orgainsm which will give them information that what the comunities are doing and how they are working .
In this regard young people will help the communities .

Secondly , They are so eager to change society and correct some things which are going wrong .
So these sorts of attitudes lead them to participate in communities .
For example , they participate as critics for some broad casting systems or newspaper companies so they will be able to make own opinion and want to influence the organisms sometimes opposing to the comments written on the nespaper or presented on the TV programs .

4839,843667.txt,P3,TUR,high,"I think that , the young people dont give enough time for helping their communities .
As the most people accept , the life has changed considerably and this causes some changes on people characteristics .
The effects of this change can be seen on the issue of the helping the communities .
The following consideratoins can be accepted to as a causes of this change

Nowadays , young people dont have sufficient amount of time to deal with the social occurances .
Young people have to participate an educational institution and they have study for their courses and this take a huge amount of time .
For the sake of the success on the life , young people have to dealt with their education , After the school life , these people encounter a job life and again this period spends a too much time of people .
As we see from this life conditions , young people can not find enough time to take part in social activities and they try to participate more preferable activites in their free time ,

The second consideration is that the young people encounter a huge amount of competition at the recent time .
As you guess , the high level of competition affects the thinking of the people and this makes people to less aware to issues that about their communities .
In the school life and the job life , young people spend a big amount of effort to reach better position and this increases the selfish level of young people .
These people only think abount better position , better education and finally more money and this is the opposite of the expected results .

Eventually , we can say that young people will be less involved in the issuses about the social life at the future becuse of the recent life style .
The people who lived in 1700 , less involved in education and the ecenomy .
Therefore , they were more involved in social activities , The level of the competition was less at these years and so people respected more to other people and the issues that are anbout the community .
We have to decrease the level of the competition and the working time in order to increase the involving level of the young people to issues about the their communities .

8682,1367075.txt,P2,ITA,high,"I think that there is a difference between how young and old people express the way they enjoy life .
Not everyone expresses this kind of emotion by accompanying it with the stereotypical connotation of `` enjoying life '' such as carefree days , endless laughs and no responsabilities .
For this reason I do not agree with the statement that younger people enjoy life more than older people .

As a matter of fact , I think older people can develop subtler , more refined and , why not , more precious ways of appreciating life .
Young people , most of the time , are bound to a definition of fun that is imposed by the media , which involves concerts , all-night partying , strenuous lifestyles and the idea that `` someone , somewhere , is having more fun than I am '' .
This makes most young people feel compelled to do more and more in order to show others that they are enjoying themselves rather then actually cherish their experiences .

Older people learn in time that enjoying life can be associated with more relaxed and `` tailored '' activities , such as hobbies or brief holidays .
I think that it might be even easier for some older people to enjoy life firstly because they can count on more financial stability and secondly because they have a lot less time to dedicate to themselves , which makes this time a lot more valuable .

Hobbies are activites people cultivate over long periods of time , and the passion with which they nurture them is a very good example of how much a person can enjoy him or herself .

I consider holidays as another good example .
When young people go on holiday , they tend to lead a lifestyle very similar to that that awaits them at home - if not more stressful ; going out every night , staying up very late , `` trying a bit of everything '' .
Older people have less time to travel but more money to spend on their trips , which enables them to choose destinations and vacation types that will make them get the most out of that limited time and , at the end of the day , `` enjoy life '' more .

11183,1832424.txt,P7,ARA,high,"Ever since I have been introduced to the learning system in our country , I have been always faced with two approaches while learning : The American approach versus the French approach to deliver knowledge .
Whereas the French system encourages the assimilation of ideas and concepts for a specific topic , the American way tends to deal with the more practical side of that topic .
But the question is : Which one is the best ?
Here lies the `` chicken first or egg first problem '' .

Some believes that the best way of teaching a student about a subject is by introducing him/her and explaining to him/her the theory behind that subject .
This way , the student knowledge about the subject is enlarged and then he/she might be able to predict facts emerging out of it .
As an example , if I want to teach someone about how an engine is turned on , I would introduce him/her to the mechanical theories and concepts behind it .

While this approach is followed by many , others believe that exposing the students to facts has far more impact than teaching the ideas and concepts .
In other words , by being exposed to facts , students will gain the advantage of interaction and most probably will be simulated , leading him/her to understand the ideas and theories behind the subject in a more efficient .
In other words , if we are to come back to that engine example mentioned above , instead of explaining the theory behind how an egine is to be turned on , the way to run the engine can be presented to the students in a way to experience and being exposed to that subject , thus assimilating much of the theories behind the idea .

I emphasize the importance of learning facts over understanding ideas and concepts .
I can still remember the effect 's power that a fact will leave on students , at least on me when I was back at the university .
I was more excited and felt more involved than when listening to abstract concepts and ideas .

And to get the most benefits possible from a trip I totally agree on going on these trips in groups and with a tour guide leading the group .

One first advantage you might gain out of having a tour guide is that you minimize , if not completely eleminate , chances of being lost , and of course that would save plenty of time that someone can use toward enjoyable events .

Traveling in groups also offer the advantage of lower costs , as there is a higher chance for the group to get numerous discounts on prices and packages than a single person would .
Staying with the same tour guide and travel agence as many times as possible will offer even extra discounts for being a long-term customer .

Having a tour guide is a great privilage , as this tour guide has enough knowledge about the places visited on the trip , specially if it is a history involving trip where you can listen to a description from a tour guide rather than reading a book or watching a video about this particular place before you visit , and of course that would save even more time .

There is always a lot of transportation on long trips traveling from one place to the other .
Being with a group is a great chance to eleminate the times where someone gets bored or feel home-sick .
Traveling in a group also create and strengthen friendship bonds in ourlives , and using travel-companion ( s ) is an awesome way to create relationships with others .

Last but not lest , infromation collected from visiting a certain place , quantitatively and qualitatively , would be a lot more accurate and precise , as these information are collected from multiple sources , between the tour guide or group members .

I have a some rasons for my opinion .
First , to specializde in one specific subject is very usefull to get a job .
For example , when you want to be a carpenter , if you learn about carpenter specifficaly , you can be a carpenter easier than you learn broad knowledge , because you learn deeply about carpenter , and also corpenter does not need too much broad knowledge .

Second , to have broad knowledg let you take more time to learn than to specialize in one specific subject .
So It is very serious problem for people , because thier graduation will be late , and time to get a job become more late .

Third , To specialize in one specific subject save cost to learn .
For example , if you have broad knowledge , you have to take much money for many textbooks to lean all of them .
In contrast , if you want to specialize in one subject , you can get few textbooks about just the subject .
So you do not have to much money to get staff for learning .

In conclusion , it is good to specialize in one specific subject because of getting jobs and saving time and cost .

4246,739111.txt,P7,DEU,high,"This question is not easy to answer .
On the one hand , I think understanding ideas and concepts is very important .
On the other hand , I think learning facts is also very necessary .

Understanding ideas and concepts , mainly determines or belongs to evolving a good sound knowledge .
A good understanding of such ideas and concepts is always a basic component of a sound knowledge .
Ideas and concepts may be taught in a very casual way , so that students can remember such ideas and concepts easier .
Perhaps they 're using quizzes or games , for example .

Learning should not consist of just learning facts by heart .
Of course , pupils and students have to learn some important facts , for instance , geographical or historical facts .
It is proved that pupils who have to learn only facts may have good or even excellent results in exams , but they also tend to forget things faster .

If pupils understand ideas and concepts , of what they have been taught , they can reproduce it more quickly .
They see basic relations between different ideas , concepts and aspects .
They probably wo n't forget things as fast as pupils do who only learned facts .

Reproduction is a very important part of the learning process .
As long as you can reproduce ideas and concepts , you know or you are able to understand what you have been taught so far .

By way of conclusion , I think students should have both , an understanding of ideas and concepts and learned fact .
The mixture is important .
Emphasis should be on the understanding .
A basis must be designed and this basis must be completed with single facts , which students have to learn .
But , the facts cannot be missed out .
It would be unthinkable to know the ideas of , for example , the French Revolution , but not knowing when this event took place .
The same with geography , it is good to know the customs and habits of , for instance , Japan , but you also have to know were it is situated .
So , as mentioned before there should be an approbriate balance between both , understanding and learning .

5117,890633.txt,P8,TEL,medium,"The definition of a successful person , is that he is an expertise in all fields .
Success always drives people to try out newer avenues and newer fields , doing a mundane , monotonous job will never lead to path of success .
Therefore , I completely agree with the facts that people should try out newer things and take risks to go ahead in life .
We can look at this by taking few examples .

If a person is a science student , who does research work on various kinds of proteins , etc .
And he needs to keep a track of his work and record all his work , then by learning computers he can arrange , save , retrive his data properly .
Even though it costs him some effort and time to learn , the person should go ahead as , it gives him better taste of success in his work .

Another example is that of , of making choice of choosing a career in a newer field , which had not been developed that much presently , example that of stem cell research , but in long run this is going be the major one in curing the genetic disorders .
So the person can take risk of entering this field , which will surely fetch him success .

Furthermore , when it comes to bussiness people , they got to try newer things and take risky decisions , since thats how great bussiness tycoons have grown up .
Coming to investing in share market , is also a risky job , since you never know status of shares the very next minute , but the one trying to take risks never goes back , since he is craving for success .

Finally , by looking at all the above examples , I can confidently state that successful people are always on a try out for newer things and willing to accept risks , since its the taste of success that is more important in ones life .

The education never stops .
It is impossible to learn everything but it is better if a person have information about everything as much as possible than keen on only one subject and do n't care about the other points .

First of all , people judge the others not carefully and it is really difficult to change their ideas .
For example , in a crowded place where people discuss their ideas , people may talk about every topic and if you are not have an idea about the subject , people do n't think about your knowledge in another subject .
So they would think that even you are uneducated instead of searching you about more .

Secondly , having information about other subjects help another subject to understand easily or better .
For example , in botany , it is also necessary to have information about chemist to critise and understand the chemistry of the plants .

To sum up , to have a little idea about everything is better than to have an amount of knowledge in one subject .

956,159190.txt,P7,FRA,medium,"Learn 's methods are really important , they allow education system to be more efficient .
There are several patterns which can be followed by teachers .
For instance , they can choose between focus upon ideas and concept s or on facts .

To understand ideas and concepts improves students ability to develop their logical skills .
These qualities are required by a lot of areas as mathematics , biology or economic .
For example , in economics , you need to understand all market 's mechanisms to be able to explain how works an economy in any country .
Ideas and concepts merely learn you how some events are engendered .

To learn facts is more important for culture .
It leads students to know the backgroung of some situations .
They can in this way easily picture in which conditions some concepts take place .
By following the same economic example , we can say that the knowledge of some history contexts allowes us to understand why at some moments economic theories have not worked .
For instance , it can be implied by an event that one of the theory 's assumptiom is no longer respected .

At hence , for all these reason I utterly disagree with this statement because understand ideas and concept is complementary to learn facts .

4653,810046.txt,P4,TUR,high,"All over the world , the importance of the advertisement to convey the information about products is not negligible .
The reason for this importance is stemmed from the fact that the advertisemetns givce the detailed information about the products of some companies .
However , there is a discussion about whether these arguments make these products seem much better than they really are or people can trust in these advertisement about the information about the products .
In my opinion , most advertisements demonstrate the products not as they really are because of the some reasons such as economical , social and political reasons .

One of the crucial reason in the unreliability of most advertisements in conveying information about the products is caused by the economical aspects .
For instance , if there is a company who needs money and support to develop themselves , to trade with another companies in order to improve their skills in their own sector , they may show their own products much better than they really are .
In addition to private companies , the public companies may desire to benefit from the people 's interest in their advertised products to make money from their sells to increase their prestige in a government .
Consequently , the economical purpose of the producers of the advertisements about their products may result in illustrating these products much more better than they really are .

Another significant reason in agreeing with the idea of not trusting most advertisements in representing the products can be proved by social reasons .
The reason for this that generally people always believe in advertisements and they do not try to know more about the advertised products in order to collect more detailed daat about them , because this kind of people choose the easiest way to get information about new methods , new innovations and they try these product without any advices from professional people .
Therefore , the existence of laziness in social life in doing research in order to learn more information about products is a factor in the creation of unreliable advertisements .

In addition to economical and social reasons in making the advertisement to show products much better than they are , the political reasons can be demonstrated as a proof .
The reason for presenting political reasons to prove my argument is that in some countries , for example in Turkey , there are some distinct rules in making the product available to use for people ; because these products shoud be reliable , tested in order to avoid the devastating results after using them .
Therefore , most advertisements try to show the products much better at the beginning to have the goverment approval in distributing them .
As a consequence of giving the situation in political side of the advertisements , it can be claimed that the desire to have approval from the political powers in order to introduce the products led to the increasing number of the advertisements which make the products much better than they really are .

As a result of giving detailed information about the reasons in economical , social and political fields , it is ovious to see that most advertisement try to present the products in order to develop their economical structure , prestige in government and benefit from the the support of people , who are lazy and so not capable in doing research about the advertised products before using them .

5627,987226.txt,P7,DEU,medium,"I disaggree with this staement .
In my opinion both , understanding ideas and concepts and studying facts , are important .

Understanding ideas and concepts are very important for students because if they just learn facts they would n't understand them when it comes to more detailed topics .
For example studying foreign languages at school .
Students can practise their vocabulary and the grammar just by learning them in their mind ( the facts and rules ) but it does n't help them when they need to read or actually speak in that language .
There you need ideas or concepts which the teacher can give you to learn that language more easily .

Moreover students need to study praxis .
With facts they can not learn them .
At this points you need concepts and ideas .
For example in a Math class .
The teacher can teach you some facts and rules about a specific topic but without his or her ideas students are not able to understand that topic .
They need to practice the topic by themselves to make sure that they actually understood the sheme of the topic .

On the other hand it is also important to study some facts .
The subject history could n't be taught without facts .
Students need to study special dates , for example about the world wars , to understand the timeframe and to get a feeling of the past .

Furthermore I think that you usually need to get some facts first before you can start to get some ideas or concepts .
The best example at this point is again the mathslesson .
You need to read some facts or proofs first before you can get into the topic .
In my mathlessons we usually had to read first a page with facts and examples before our teacher explained everything a little bit more detailed .

All in all I am of the opinion that students need to understand ideas and concepts on the one hand and on the other hand I believe that it is important as well that they study some facts .

However , in my experience is more important to understund ideas and concepts than just simple facts .

First , I belive that by focusing entirely in facts you are missing the opportunity to understund concepts and ideas surrounding facts .
It is important for students to have a good understanding of the situation going beyond facts so this way they can extrapolate these learnings to different situations .

Second , as a professional chemical engineer myself I have always never seen that a situation is the same twice in my career .
It can be similar but not the same , the only way to tackle new situations is by being clear and understand the ideas and concepts of the situation .
As a result of my background and training as an engineer it is almost strange to solve problems based only in the specific facts you have learned in your career .
You need to again go back to the basics and focus on concepts and ideas to be succesful not just facts .

Also , by having a special focus on ideas and concepts you can help develop the creativity of students .
It is important to encourage students to understand not just ideas and concepts but from there to develop their thought process and creativity .
By focusing only in facts , it can be challenging to develop other areas like creativity if the only things students are facing are facts for particulat situations .
Moreover , by looking at the big picture you are also helping students to understand how in many situations facts can be different but the ideas and concepts are the same .

Last but not least , it is important to keep in perspective that we live in a constantly changing world and by making for students more important to understund ideas and concepts they will be better prepared to be succesful in the future which will bring to them newer and more challinging problems than what we have experienced in the past .

the meaning of democracy came from the latin word democratus which was writin by Aristotle , a famous greek philosopher .
the meaning of democrasy is when a group of people are working for a common cause to help their own country or civilization .
I think that people today areussualy more keen on helping their own desires even if their own desires can interfere with other peoples standars or affairs .

Darwin 's Theory `` Survival of the fitist , '' is what basically going on in the world today .
i for one like to help both the community and my self , but i would stop helping the community if doing so will effect me personnaly .
One thing i have noticed is that helping the community is in such a low level , that most school require community service in order for a student to graduate , forcing people to help the community is a great sign that people are not really paying attention to their own community .

Helping the community can come in many different forms ; polution , respect , civilized behavior and following the rules. a person can help his community by buying unleaded cars causing less smoke in the enviroment , another problem that can be characterized as polution is littering , i have watched many people in my community litter as the government doesnt have strict rules for people to abide by them .
respect between people in the same community is quite necessary where a person should never fight another person or argue , which is good for communal stabilization .

People should work harder on helping their communities instead of their own , because by doing so your benefiting yourself and the people around you inderectly .
If the community is shown as as a quiet peaceful community then the urge to benefit ones self will become less , for other people can be benefiting you .

4496,782773.txt,P1,DEU,medium,"I disagree with this statement because i think to have a specialized qualification is better than a broad knowledge .

On the one hand ist good to have a broad knowlege of many academic subjects because you might find a job easier .
And with broad knowledge you may stay between two typs of an industrial branch .

But on the other hand threre are three arguments to spesify in a subject .
At first there is the point that when you have only one subject you are better in this like anonther person who knows only a bit of this part and so from the view of a company you are more interesting to them like the other .

The second argument is that when you might loose your job you will easier find a job in this subject like the person who knows only half of the subject .
Fir instance when you go to a company to apply for a job and you have a higher knowledge if the boss of the personal management asks you some questions about the subject you will have a better chance to get the job .

Last but not least when you are rearly good in your subject you will have the opportunity to get a leading position in a company an give instructions to those who only have a bit of this knowlege than you .
And as a result of this you might earn more money because you are a specialist in your job .

As a conclusion of these statements i will take the way of specialization in a specific subject because i want to have these three typs which i wrote above and not only beeing a normal employee with a boss .
I want to be the boss .

5414,945827.txt,P1,TEL,high,"I believe that , it is never good to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
You always get the best when you specialize in one specific subject .
Specializtion in one particular subject that helps you build your career will not only bring interest during the study but will also give you the satisfaction when working through it .

First let me state that generally all the subjects are vast , and studying these vast subject in which a person is not interested may lead to improper knowledge about the subject .
As an old saying saying says `` HALF KNOWLEDGE IS ALWAYS DANGEROUS '' , it would turn dangerous .
Furthurmore no person could cover all the things in all the subjects in a given academic time .
Practically , a doctor has to go through those subjects that are totally different from what a biologist go through .
A doctor has 5 years of academic time to study and master all the things about the human body and a biologist has around 3-4 years to study about all the animals .
Now if a person thinking to have a broad knowledge and knowing all the subjects in this 5 years , is it possible for the person to master either of these ?
He would neither become a perfect doctor nor a good biologist .

In general keeping academic time aside , interest of person matters a lot .
He must be focused on what he is interested .
Most of the people they will not be interested in all the sujects , say , i never liked math and programming , i always liked biology , now will a person like me , will he be interested in learning all the other sujects effectively say math ?
He will concentrate on only those subjects that yield him benefit , its like when a person goes furthur in his career would the other subjects really help him ?
Its mere waste of time , if this time is utlilized for improving his knowledge in the field he is interested , this would help him better for his career , and in career job satisfaction is always much more important than any other thing .
Let us consider a biotechnologist , his work is discovering new vaccines , relating pathology etc. , if he would have learned law during his academics would that thing really help him in any way ?
There are other people who can do that job efficiently than this person who is not at all interested in doin that job .
So for this reason too i say that having proficiency in a particular subject is always better than wasting time in learning all the unnecessary stuff and having a broad knowledge of the academic subjects .

Finally , the implications in the passage would state clearly that , it is not important for a person to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , but its really very good for a person to gain profieciency in one particular subject that helps him inbuilding his career and do better in his job , in all required aspects .
Its always good be a master instead of calling ourselves `` THE JACK OF ALL TRADES BUT MASTER OF NONE '' .

9531,1536321.txt,P8,DEU,medium,"I do n't think that successful people try new things and take new risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
Of course we all no famous examples of people beeing successful in making a new invention , trying new ways of buisiness or starting new directions in arts , music and literature .
But I think this is not the majority of the successful people .
I rather think that the personality of them is usually another one , which is my first point against the statement .
It is always easier to do what people accept somebody to do and to use old methods to become a successful person .
It might be sad , but it is rather likely to become successfull by using old `` tricks '' , your family background or connections .
So I think the personality of most of successful people is rather one , which uses the old ways , than one , that tries new ways .
We only sometimes think that the opposite is true , because people , which were successful in making a new invention for example are more important for other poeple and for us .
So we know them better .
And when a successful buisinessman trys for example a new trading practice , he has a better chance to make good money , because he has already a helfull background .
And once more we will hear about him more likely , althow most of successful buisinessmen would not do this .

My second important point is , that a person , which is working and living successfully has no reason for trying new methods or changing his live .
Why should such a person take a risk ?
The history shows for example , that most of the people coming to America were poor people , which had nothing to lose .
The richer ones usually stayed in there country , where they had a safe live .

10105,1641717.txt,P7,ZHO,medium,"When we come out the ideas we can creat the ideas and and the concepts .
Since that we must care about the facts .
As far as I am concerned , I am strongly disagree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to lean facts .

First of all , in real life , facts include many unfornseen troubles .
The diffical facts will become valuable experience .
They will tell us how to do it and what we need to do .
The hard facts will allow us to endure hard times in the future .
It also provide many information for us to think deeper and more close to the real life .

Secondly , facts is very important in the real life .
Even you can realated the ideas and the concepts , you can think that as well as you can , you still need to care about the facts .
If the facts in the real life did n't work very well .
No matter the ideas and the concepts is well , the facts also play an important part in the real life .

Third , facts state the important position between the ideas and the concepts .
The facts can let the ideas and the concepts go through fluquently .
Without the facts , all the ideas and the concepts is empty .
The facts will let people think deeper and more comprehensive .
It provide a broader range for for people to explore it by themselves .

All in all , I strongly state that for people to learn facts is more important for them to learn or understant ideas and the concepts .
Facts is so important that it play an very important position in the real life .
It connect the ideas and the concepts to make it into real .

2357,408780.txt,P7,ITA,low,"I do n't think that learning facts is less important than understanding ideas or concepts : both are demanding skills of our society and are useful in different situations .
There are situations that require the ability of understanding ideas like those in which a student is asked to solve a new problem .
But there are also situations like a scientist in a laboratory where either he knows how the chemical reaction is being evolving or he risks serious damages .
In other words , sometimes it is essential to know facts .

We can capture another aspect If when comparing this two activities we argue that learning is not so expensive like understanding .
I do n't believe that .
For some people it is very difficult to keep in mind even a telephone number , so I think that the cost of learning may vary from one individual to another .

In conclusion it depends from the situation .
Mathematicians are notably asked to understanding ideas , but are we sure that they also do n't learn facts ?
No .

5646,991346.txt,P6,HIN,high,"I completely agrees with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by tour guide .
In today 's world where advancements are taking place in every field , tourism industry is also marching ahead with great speed .
Now you can easily get the group packages at cheap prices with a tour guide who will show you all the famous places and will take care of your food and luggage while on tour .
Travelling in a group provides you the advantage of guide 's experience and group security , provide you cheap packages and lot of fun than travelling alone or with family .

While travelling in a group led by guide , you can benefit from the guide 's experience because he can guide you which places are the best to go .
He can tell you about some famous temples , churches and beaches etc. , while travelling alone you may miss these things .
Another advantage of group travelling is the security , there will be no fear of getting lost or attacked by somebody at outside place because there will always be somebody with you to help you .

Travelling in a group is cheaper too , because you can easily bargain with travelling agency over the ticket fares , hotel charges etc. because travelling agency will always prefer the group travel .
On the other hand , if you are travelling alone you have no options and buy the tickets at higher prices , and pay more for hotel room .

Travelling in a group means lot of fun .
You can never get bored while travelling in group , because you can crack jokes , play cards , and can have singing competitions too .
While if you are alone you will be devoid of all this fun .

While travelling alone has its own advantages of privacy and being with the family but i will still prefer travelling in group .
I think group travel can convert a good trip into great one .

3431,594970.txt,P7,ITA,high,"In general I agree with this statement .
The task of education is to learn general skills , concepts and cultural abilities that can be useful in different situations .
If the students are fed up only with facts and particular informations they are not likely to develop the ability to collect , use and elaborate these informations .

We may use two kinds of examples to shed a light on this question .
Firstly , let us use this comparison .
If the mind is like a computer , we can say that the concepts are like the software and that the facts are like the informations processed by the software .
Without the software the brute informations have no meaning and are useless , but , nevertheless , without the informations the software is empty .
Then , concepts and facts are necessary to each other .

Secondly , we may analyse the case of history .
There is a great historiographical debate between those who conceive the history as made of singular facts and those who see the history as made of great movements .
But leaving aside this problem , we can say that the general historical concepts , such as modernization , industrial revolution , etc. , help the historian in the collection and interpretation of the facts .
Without a general idea that gives the direction , the historian would not be able to make his research and give a meaning to the facts he collects .
Furthermore , general historical concepts are very useful for the students .
Without learning basic historical movements and periods , a student cannot remember so many historical facts .
Concepts help the memory and the understanding of things .

As a general conclusion , we may say that , if the facts give the specifical informations on a topic , the concepts provide the general understanding .
Probably , the concepts stem from an operation of synthesis of different facts under a unique point of view , but when a concept is understood , it can be used as a tool in different situations .

Finally , it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts , because the task of education is the development of general skills .
If this is not learned the student will not be able to work on the facts and will be like an database full of information and unable to use them .

4633,807184.txt,P4,DEU,medium,"In our modern time of new ways of communication via television or internet it is not difficult to make a product seem much better through advertisements than it really is .

Lets take for example a pencil which is praised to be of very high qualitiy at tele-shopping , of course for a low price .
The costumer will pick up the telephone and order this lovely pencil .
Two weeks later he got the small packet with the little pencil in it and he ca n't wate to open it .
Still he thinks he made a good deal with what he bought on TV , very practical and easy buying .
But what happens in the end ?
The colour of the pencil is blue instead of black as it was shown on TV .
The writing is not that lovely as it was described in the advertisment .
What now ?
Big disappointment .

As we see in this little example the new medias have the power to manipulate the costumer in a way he does not even take note of it .

The composion of the light in which the product is recorded , or the frame in which it is showed can make it seem bigger , smaller , nicer etc .
For the costumer it is hard to imagine how the product looks like in reality .
This kind of manipulation bz making things appear better than thez really are is a profession for itself , in that way one can imagine how effective these tools must be .

Conclusona ; in may opinion in many cases the original product is very different in aspect and quality so that one has to be carefull with too fast decisions about buying a product .

It is always better to put down the glasses of advertisments and look with zour own eyes

10091,1639926.txt,P1,JPN,medium,"In my opinion , I support the idea to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to specialize in one specific subject .
There are two reason why I support the idea .

First of all , to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects to help us to think about things wide angle .
For example , if I have different opinion from my friend , and get fight from it , then I think it is very important to try to think in different angle .
In other words , to avoid to think my claim is always right .

Another reason why I support the claim is because it would help me to live in society with enjoying .
To have various knowledge may provide me to communicate with people easily .
Because I simply imagine that if I have various knowledge , then I wo n't have much tough time to concider what shoud I talk to people .
It will provide me many friends .

I do not think to specialize in one specific subject is bad .
Actually , I respect people who is professional about specific subject , because it is result of their concentraining and devote time to study about it .
That is great effort I think .

Howe , I think to have various knowledge means similar to be flexible person .
I would like to be flexible person .
What is flexible person for me is , to think about wide range , and can think about by standing other person 's position .
Then my world would be more expand and life will be more enjoyable .

Above all , I support the opinion to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than not .

From the time being mankind had appeard on this earth , the real man is contiously trying to achieve maximum of knowledge in order to attain the ultimate peak of success and power .
For this many ways had been organised by us and one of the most important way to do this work is to attain excellence in science , research , arts and technology .

Th topic of discussion here is that whether it is better to have broad konwledge of many acadmic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject .
In my point of view , I can thoughfully say that it is good to have only one subject to keep in concern than to deal with many areas of acadmic studies .

First of all , to live in society where educated people recide it is important for each one of us to have the minimum required knowledge of all the subject which could be of essential use for our future .
For this I would like to take an example which about a child who wants to becom a pilot and has always studied physical sciences amd maths and no other thing .
But now , how can he communicate with others , to feel others and to show his feeling towards others , to mix and organise things related to the world of other subjects .
So this is cumpulsory for all of us to attain a minimum amount of knowledge about all the things so that our life moves on smoothly .

But , I would lay more stress on the fact that one should be more specific about the subject or the area of study when one is going though his higher studies .
The main reason behind this is that , now in this accelerating world we ca n't excell in an area or field unless we are very specific in that work .
The other main here is that if we are specific we can show our complete effort in a particular field and can serve the society in best way we can and this is th omly thing required for excellence in all the fields .

As a conclusion the best way to move is to be specific together having required intrests in all other ares also .

What used to be very simple , like introducing a new product to a market , has become a real challenge .
Now a days there are so much markets that are compiting between them , that the product that has the best marketing strategy is the one with the biggest revenues .

The best way to obtain attention from the clients , is showing them a product that covers all their needs , products that can do everything at the same time .
That is why most products seem much better than they really are , because there is no such product that can cover all , and even most , of the needs or wants of the posible buyer .

In television most products that are being advertised , really does not work .
That is why they tell you `` if you call within the next 2 minutes you will get a bonus pack '' , this way they get the attention of the person , by making them think they are getting not only the fabulous product , but also the amazing bonus pack , distracting them from the real product .

Another way of getting the attention of posible buyers is buy selling them lies .
Advertisements tell you all the things that the product can do , but really most of the time it just works partially , or not at all .

At the end , most people are really unsatisfied with the product they have bought , and end up buying the one which they really needed , and not the one that is giving you lots of promotions , that at the end does not satisfies the custumer .

3012,523338.txt,P7,ITA,medium,"To understand ideas and concepts is very important , but not more important than to understand facts .
At the contrary , I would say that the order in which they know both things is the real point .
I think that if you want understand facts , you need to know before well ideas that are at the base of them .
Behind the facts there always are concepts .

That is why when the students go to school , they need an education from their parents before .
Mainly the education in family is the base which teachers can build on .
Exactly like when it needs the house to built the roof .

So , concepts and ideas , learnt when they were children , and improved by going to school , and reading books and studying , must be strong and very clear , to build the facts on .

A very good example is to study history .
When a student studies history , he/she would need to know some clear ideas , to understand well which are the causes of a war , which thinks and feelings were involved to cause a war .
When they know the ideas , they will figure out easily the consequence of the act of the war , caused by ideas .

But especially , to understand the very central concepts of every-day life is important to live in harmony with other people .
They should know which are the right behaviours to live in their society , and these they should learn by their parents , and by growing up with their friends .
As a consequence , they will be able to apply the ideas to their lifes , and to transform the concepts in acts .

However , if they had understood only the consequence of ideas , the facts , they would not deeply have comprehend what there is behind them .
In other words , if they know the causes , they can use them to figure out the facts .

To sum it up , I think it is important for students to have a deep and strong background of ideas and concepts about central points of which are the right and wrong behaviours , and about evrything about the life in general , to be able to use them and transform in and understand the facts , for all the duration of their life .

2032,350859.txt,P1,FRA,medium,"I think it is really important nowadays to have many academic subjects .
Indeed , a person who have different skilled can easily understand different point of view in a company .
This understanding is really necessary for people who is an manager .
He has to managed people , suppliers , to understand consumers , to take decisions for his company .
For example he has to take financial decisions which are really important in a company if he does not take in account all the advantages or drawbacks of his decisions .

The survey of the company can be in danger .
Moreover , we can take the example of an individual entrepreneurs as a director of a restaurant .
If the director do not have knowledge in cooking , the cooker can do everything he wants .
This kind of advantage can be dangerous for the director because he does not really understand all about his own restaurant .
I think that sometimes is really necessary to have knowledge in different types of subjects even if we are specialized in on or few specifics subjects .

Furthermore , it can be really interesting to somebody to have different academic sujects not only for working but to his own .
As for me , I think we can have both , knowledge of many academic subjects and be specialized in on specific subject .
Both can be an advantage , a strenght .
Everything is changing so fast so people have to understand rapidly why and how things change to take efficient decision for a company .

I 'm going to have to say that I agree with this statement because I am one of the people who watches advertisement show and buy products that I want .
I do n't think this is a good way to choose which products to buy , but how are we going to buy the products without an advertisements ?
And why dose it make products seem much better than they really are with advertisement ?

The answer is really simple , it 's just that some compnay make look the products better in advertisements .
Basically what they are doing is lieing .
In oreder to find a good products without using the advertisements , people should ask their friends about the products they want to buy .

One day , I bought this watch that was said in the advertisements that this watch never brakes and could hold on to great amount of gravity .
When I went into the deep pool , it was broken .
I was really sad and mad at the same time .

Advertisements make the products sound better , but the product it self is n't good as what is said on the advertisements .
Since the product it self is n't good as it says on the advertisements , the company who pruduce the products would not make a great amount of money .

Like I said in the beggining , I do agree with the statement , but I do n't agree using the advertisements to sell the products .
Without a advertisements , it would tough for the compnay to sell .
Same as people who wants to buy the products .
For doing this , only the good products which costs less and has good quality is going to be sold .
What is the purpose of making an advertisements ?
Customers could be the advertisments .

A good example of this theory is Bill Gates , that has used the innovation to become the most important person in all the world and now he can do everything he wants .
As far as I 'm concerned , I 'd like to have an idea like Bill Gates , because I 'm sure that this idea could be a solution to all my economic problems !!

But I also believe that if you do what you know how to do well , you can have a normal and nice life , with some good aspects but also with some problems , instead if you want to become a successful man , the only thing that you can do is to try an original job or a new trend , because in this era only if you are a creative person you can found success and easy money .
For instance , my father has done the same job for thirty years , and he has a very normal life , he helps me with the University 's taxes and he has lot of friends , but he 's too far to be a successful man .

In spite of it 's very difficult to be considered a successful person , there are lots of successful man in all the world , so I think that it 's not impossibe to become an important man , but it 's sure that if you do n't look for a new idea , you ca n't be considered like this one , so in conclusion I 'm agree with the statement .

6021,1028131.txt,P3,JPN,high,"I disagree with the statement , `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities '' .
The first reason why I disagree with the statement is that I know young people who spend time in helping their communities .
In my university , there are activities that involve helping the community .
For example , there is a marathon coming up this month , and some of my classmates will help organize this event .
It involves interacting with the community , and it should be a great help for the community .

The second reason why I disagree with the statment is that young people do not have enough time to spend on their communities .
If they go to school or college , they have to spend time on their study , so even if they have the will to spend time helping their communities , they cannot do so because they just do not have the time .
I think that it is enough for young people to help when they can , and that it should not be something that they are forced to do .
I am busy most of the time studying , and it is hard for me to participate in events just because I do not have enough time .

A third reason why I disagree with this statement is because I do n't think there is enough information sent to young people about events that are happenening in their community .
If they do not have the information , they cannot help , even if they have the will to do so .
I know that if I look hard for information , I should be able to find ways in helping my community , but it is not easy to find this kind of information .

In conclusion , I think that young people nowadays give enough time to helping their communities .
There are people who are actively involved in activities in their communities , and if they have the time and information , I think many people will be willing to help .
I think the most important thing to do is to inform young people about events happening in their communities .
I think that accusing young people for not helping is wrong , and that there is a need for an environment that makes young people want to participate in helping their communities .

1056,173502.txt,P8,ARA,high,"I agree with the statement `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .

The statement above is considered to be statisticly true due to the fact that those successful people have a back-up plan that they are currently using which is the things they are already doing .
The saying `` If it ai n't broke do n't fix it '' is false for the business world .

If those sucessful people keep clinging to what they already have eventuallly somebody else will take thier idea and evolve it or take it to another level , thus leaving those successful people no choice but to take risks and try new ideas .

If successful people try new ideas that help them and further increase thier profit and help them build a better reputation then they will gladly take that idea .
If they try something new and hope that it becomes successful then the faith that they put in thier new idea ( ex .
project , product , or any other thing ) will either strengthen or weaken depending on the outcome of the new idea .

In life it 's either eat or be eaten .
The same rule applies to the business world .
If you have a plan that you might think will work or will not work then you should take a chance and not any chance but a calculated chance that gives you hope of letting your plan work or flourish .
Many people try to invent new gizmo 's or even update old ideas , but they fail in doing so becuase they lack the financial aid or even the help from people , that is why only successful people take chances and try new ideas so that their success continues and that thier business continues to grow .

You could not imagine how beautiful that picture are --- at that very moment when they are walking together , talking and smiling , it is the happiness .

11817,1946030.txt,P8,TUR,medium,"All over the world , if we examine the present and past , there is two kind of person , one who serves their life in the known ways , just simply survives and the extreme ones who make new things try to find new ways and takes risks which can not be taken .
I am totaly agree that successful people are the ones that who try the new and take risks even if I can not be taken before .

Firstly , success is something like not to be done by everyone , in opposite you can say that reading is a success , but nowadays it is not because everybody can read .
In that point it might be a good example to give the Wright Brothers flying expriences , 100 years before they tried to fly , and they took the biggest risk which can be caused by death .
They were successful inventors .
And I think that is the meaning of success .

After that I can be known that the times that risks are taken might be the break down of the history , and if you dont take the risk you can not survive .
In the history , there is certain times that whole future is in the hands of a human being .
One cannot say that the risk of Hannibal to pass tha Alpines ( the Mountain above the italy ) in the middle of the winter was not a risk , but at the end he reached with his chosen army to the center of Italy to Rome .
He was a successful soldier .
Sometimes if you dont take risks you cannot survive .

Finally , trying new things is one of the most strong way to be successful .
The other ways done by lots of people lots of time and you can see that they all not did anything new .
For example , the great experimental physicist M. Faraday , try the new way of understanding the unknown area , and until he was shown on the scene it might be tried these experiments over hundred times .
Of course he is a successful man because he tried the new and think the new .

All in all , the whole world is turning over the successful persons hands , and if you tried to look up their most attracted works they tried the new , they take the risk .

The significance of this place is known to me but other then that I have no clue what exactly it stands for .
Tour guides are those people who will know the in and out of this place and they will have wide range of knowledge about this place and its tourist points .
So once when we reach this place and visit places like Brahma temple which is one of its kind in the whole world , from these tour guides we will get to know more about the temple , the history , other significance etc .
Apart from the temple they will take us to all the other places which is famous or has some other historic standing .
And being in a group its always fun because we can have lot of interactions and have loads of fun .

Apart from this if these tour guides are travelling with us from our starting point ( the place where we departed from ) they will take care of all the hotel bookings , our lunch / dinner , the number of days we need to stay , the amount of time we need to spend at each place and etc .
So we tend to benefit more from them and the extra cost we will have to pay for this will be negligible .

When the tour guide is taking care of all the above things we as tourist can just relax and enjoy the trip .
The whole travel is organised in a proper way and it becomes a wonderful experience to be remembered for life long .

1718,293987.txt,P1,JPN,medium,"I do not agree the idea that it is bettr to have borad knowledg of many academic subjects to specialize in one specific subjects .
I have tow reson of it : our job and interesting for people .

First , specific skills are useful when people find their job .
Most of campanies want people who have them , because they can give the campany new idea or new skill .
In fact , when we have interview test for enter some company , we need to apeel our unique points and differences from others .
Specific skills are provide for good work .

Second , to specialize in one specific subject is interesting for ourselves and for people around us , because people who have their specific subject know something that everyone do not know .
They can choose only one subject what they want to study , moreover they can give everyone surprising , interest or notice .
For example , my teacher was major in Japanese history at university so he has specific knowledge of it .
He often tells his students interesting story .

We do not know most of them so we always be really amaized but his story is really interesting .
In conclusion , it is good for us to have one specific subject in that we can get our job easily and we can give people around us amazing .
If you have it , you are looked as a great peason

10367,1688133.txt,P2,JPN,medium,"I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Now , to make the statement clearly , I define the age of each people .
I set the age of young people around 20 , and the age of older people around 60 .

I can not decide which people enjoy more because both of them has different kind of things to enjoy their life .
So , I would like to compare some points .
The ordinary differences between young people and older people are the phisical ability , the quantity of money , the variety of the experience and so on .
Now , I compare these things between young people and older people .

First , as to the phisical ability , young people has more ability than older people .
So , we can say that young people enjoy more than older people such as sports or dancing all night or other thing which needs energy .

second , as to money , most older people have more money than they were young .
So , older people can enjoy more than young people when doing something costs a lot .
For example , my parents enjoys their life with using more money than it used to be .
They go to the restrant often and eat delicious meat , and they go to concert or see the show .
These things are costs too much for the young people to enjoy often .

Third , the quality of experience is greatly differd between young people and older people .
Because Young people have not know various things in the society yet , they can experience new things everyday .
So they enjoy knowing new things , new people , new ways of thinking .
On the other hand , older people can live with their various experiences for their long life .
In the 60 years , they experienced various kinds of things which the young people have not expereinced yet .
So , they know more enjoyable things than young people .

Considering these points , I can not say that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Both people enjoys their own life with their own steps .

10704,1746653.txt,P1,TUR,medium,"Nowadays it is considered as a very popular topic that one should have knowledge of many academic subjects or specialize in one topic .
Many people ignores this topic but it is very important for the university students and ones who have an aim to have an academic career .

Opponents of the idea ` having one specific subject ' consider that one should have relative subjects like maths and physics , so when they see an Integral in the middle of a physics lesson , they should avoid the problems with ease .
Moreover they think that one can earn much money when s/he has two or more subjects .
In addition to that it will ease the communication between student and teacher , when they have many things to talk about .

Although in first sight it is seen that one should have many academic subjects , it is not like it is seen .
First of all one should know a lot of things about Maths if she/he is a physician .
So s/he does n't have to make longer his/her study and be also an mathematician .
It will bore the teacher when s/he is young and a university student and s/he can change his/her plan being an academician .

In addition to that it is always considered that one can earn a lot of money when s/he has two or more subjects .
The answer is simple : No !
The academicians are paid by the hours that they teach .
No one pay you much money even if you have ten subjects or one .
The payment is always the same .

Thirdly physicians do n't have to know much about psychology .
Because thay have no time to spend with another subject for just finding a topic with students to talk about .
If they want to talk about something they can talk about football matches , TV programs etc ..

At last we should consider that academicians are busy people and they are being waited for the researches and new technologies .
The second subject will reduce the chance of discover the new part of the modern life because thay wo n't have time and energy to focus on the new researches .
If everyone could do just his/her own job , the world would have been probably different and lovely ..

7087,1122215.txt,P6,TEL,medium,"As our topic is about The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
i strongly agree with the note , as it has adavantages over the travelling with out a guide .
first we discuss about the travel with out guide .

As everyone interested to go to new places as per their knowledge .
they want to know the each and every thing present over there .
before going everyone will do research about that , and information we got is very little when compare when we encountered it .
sometimes it misses out good places sourrounded to that , no one is ready to explain the histroy of cultures and history of that place and also the how the importance came to that place , all these information is known to the people who staying overthere or people who visits often to the places .

Now come to the travel with guide , as they have very best of information .
now i will give my personal experince so that it elevates the advantages of travel with guide , during my college days we went to the nothern part of the india , it included few places .
when went to Tajmahal there we found very beautifull monument ever built , the guide explained the when it was built , who statrted this , and cultures followed that time , and some important things he told , after listening the lecture he made about Tajmahal , we came to know we had very little information about that .
we very much excited about the information , we really felt like we are viewing that constuction and art .
As we thought Tajmahal was the only place to visit , but the guide showed another beautiful monument just away from Tajmahal .
we dont about that before , that was also a good piece too .
After that we faced some problems regarding our trip , just lack of enough time , in that time our guide was so helpful , he planned accordingly out timings so that we not lost even single location .
As the guide was a local guy he provided good food too .
Throughout the journey we made with guide is very interesting and very helpful , after the tour we heard and learned good things like history information about the places etc .

Finally my conclusion was its not possible to know the things that really happened at the historical places , few things we can read or listen about those places but some we may not .
so taking a guide is really helpful and informative .
so that we can get more information than when we went to the travel without guide .

1386,230893.txt,P1,TEL,high,"I disagree with the above statement for , simply put , it means `` Jack of all trades and master of none '' .
I certainly have no idea who came up with this particular phrase but I do percieve it to be very true and apt .
A `` broad knowledge '' to my understanding may be defined as enough facts to project a scholarly image in refined society .
In other words , claiming to have a read a book by reading its ' back cover .
Limited knowledge of multiple topics is of no real use unless a person 's vocation requires him to possess such knowledge .

Specialization on the other hand is what leads to pure genius .
Certainly some men are born a true genius .
But others can get there through hard and consistent work in their particular field meaning specialization .
To support my idea I put forward four exemplaries , Indian nuclear scientists - Dr. Homi Bhaba , Vikram Sarabhai , Raja Ramanna , Dr. Abdul Kalam .
These men shaped Indian nuclear history .
They absorbed nuclear science into their very blood and brought about a revolution in the nuclear field .
India owes its present day nuclear status to these men who laid the foundation stone for the edifice of Indian Nucleardom .
What would be our status today if these men settled for a broad outlook on general knowledge ?

But this is not to indicate that specialization makes every person reach the heights that these four have achieved .
But certainly an in-depth knowledge of any subject leaves the individual with a personal sense of satisfaction for actually having achieved a milestone and also brings him a respectful position in society where his achievement is appreciated by both his friends and others .
If we , for example take a heart specialist or a engineer constructing houses , they cannot hope to execute their respective tasks without specialization in their fields .
They touch the live of all the people they serve and in addition to their remuneration , they also earn the lasting gratitude of the people for a service well-rendered .

1383,230375.txt,P3,TEL,high,"I agree with the opinion that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping out other members of their communities .
The reasons for this are manyfold and it shows how people 's ideas about their responsibilities have been changing over the years .

Perhaps the single most important reason for this is the growing pace of life in the modern world .
Due to the rapid advances in technology , ` staying current ' is an important issue today .
People in general and young people in particular are increasingly concerned about their careers and are forced to spend more and more time updating themselves .
A software engineer for example , would have to learn to program in the latest languages or risk getting fired .

Given these circumstances , the youngsters are faced with more and more challenges at an early stage .
They have to work harder and be more ambitious to have a successful career .
An unforunate outcome -- younsters are becoming more and more self-centered and do not spend enough time helping their communities .
And this is why we see more and more old people moving to the home for the aged , because their children are too busy with their careers .

Even in countries where there are rules for younsters to do community service ( in the form of serving in the army , say ) , they work only in a half-hearted manner and are concerned about their private lives and their careers to a much greater extent .
One , cannot , of course , blame them for they are not expected to compromise their lives for the sake of the community .

Concluding , I think that the main reason towards this shift is the growing influence of technology and the fast-paced world which is turning peop

11727,1931885.txt,P1,JPN,low,"I think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
Because we have to use many kowledge in our life .
I have two reasons .
Let me show you why .

First of all , if we study only one subuject , maybe our eyesight will narrow even the subject were supecific subject .
For example , friends .
the other day I watched kind of documentary TV program .
A scientist had studied about science since he was elenentary shool student .
As a result he got a master 's degree when he was high school student , but he was always alone , no friends .
I think it is problem because I think frends are more important than academic kowledges because I can not live without friends .
If we just study inpaticure our school days , we will be boring man .

Next , If we studied many academic subjects we could consider many differnts way about some problems .

1535,256468.txt,P6,DEU,high,"When people travel to cities and other places worth seeing , they may make use of a guided tour during their stay .
There are good reasons for having a guided tour in a group , but personally I believe that traveling on your own has greater benefits .

One reason is that a tour guide may only show a select portion of the site being visited .
This is mainly due to time constrictions in their schedule and because the tour is generally scripted .
If there is something that has struck your personal interest during the tour , the tour guide may not give you enough time to closely examine it and move on .
When traveling alone , you have all the time in the world to experience and look at things .
It also is more of an adventure because you have to figure out on your own how things are done at a particular place .
If you are lost however you can always just buy a map and a tour guide booklet .

Another reason for not traveling in a guided tour is that you may not like the people you are with in your group .
Imagine saving up all your money to go travel and then become anoyed by fellow group members on the first day .
This means that you will be with them until the end of the trip .

A further reason why traveling alone or with friends is better that a guided tour is that you will likely have better memories from the trip .
This is because when people travel without a guide they will get into personal situations , rather that group situations .
If you and your friends have gotten into difficulties , for example not been able to communicate to locals because of a language barrier , then you will have something to talk about at home after your trip .
Situations like this stay in your memory for a long time because you have a story to share with friends .
These situations are unlikely to happen with a tour guide .

My three reasons should point out why I prefere to travel unguided , and you can always just

3473,603015.txt,P7,ITA,high,"Knowledge is made of two basic components : the facts , that we can describe as the empirical evidence that our senses , or machines , provide us about reality ; and the ability we have to extract actual information out of this unordered data , which we may refer to as `` ideas '' or better , as interpretations .
Any useful knowledge stock must be made of this two components strongly integrated .

But even if both of the components are foundamental , they have n't the same level of usufullness : while facts can be looked up in books or any other reliable source , a strong conceptual foundation on a subject , which allows for rapid and effective extraction of information , cannot be built overnight .

Specifically in technic and scientific subjects , it 's utterly stupid to try to learn by memory the huge amount of formulas , numbers , rules of thumb necessary for example in engineering .
It is far better to build up the technic and practical skills required in such a field and then go back to the details whenever they are needed , and if possible memorize them over time and exercise , so that they will be stuck in our memory for years once mastered , instead that for days or weeks .

Our memory can be easily paralleled with an archive : an empty archive with a rational structure and the right labels already in place can be filled in no time , an archive which is full of paper but where organizational mayhem reigns , is going to be almost useless , or require an excessive effort to get anything valuable out of it .

Thus students should value carefully every side of the subjects they 're studing , but put a stronger effort on building a conceptual foundation that will allow them to effectively exploit what they have learned trough the years : they should nonetheless be very careful to `` fill the archive '' to have something to exploit in future years !

8501,1335119.txt,P4,ZHO,high,"I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Advertisements are meant to convince potential buyers to purchase certain items .
Therefore , in order to convince the buyers , advertisements almost always make products appear better than they really are .
My reading of an article on the local newspaper and my personal experience of purchasing a skin care product prove this point to be true .

I once read an article on a local newspaper that informed readers about the art of advertisement .
The article said that in order to convince the potential buyers to purchase certain items , the advertising market must make the products to appear as amazing as possible , even if they appear better than they actually are .
So that potential buyers will be convinced of the products ' worth and effectiveness .
If the advertisements make the products seem worse or the way they really are , they will have a more difficult time to convince buyers .
In my opinion , the article had a point .

In addition to the article , my personal experience also proves that most advertisements make products seem better .
I have always wanted clear , smooth skin .
I remember seeing an advertisement of a skin care product on the television .
The product was described in the advertisement to be so effective that I was completely convinced before even trying it .
However , after purchasing the skin care product and using it for two months , I still had countless pimples on my face and the quality of my skin did not improve at all .
This experience showed me that advertisement make products much better than they really are .

Both the article on my local newspaper and my personal experience prove to me that most advertisements make products seem better than they actually are .
In numerous cases , the products that buyers purchase in reality do not live up to their descriptions in their advertisements .
So next time when I purchase an item , I will not judge its worth and effectiveness just by looking at its advertisement .

4913,856381.txt,P1,ITA,medium,"I do n't absolutely agree with the statement .
I study at university since I was 19 years old and in these three years I 've understood how has been important to have choosen one specific subject to study .
Usually the most important universities offer a lot of courses : each one belongs to a specific subject .
For instance , I study `` transport and logistics engineering '' , that is a particular aspect of the world of engineering .
This does n't mean that I do n't study the basic subjects of engineering ( as mathematic analysis , phisics , statystics etc . )
: I study these subjects the same , but perhaps I study only their basic aspects .
If i had to study all the aspects of all the subjects , I think I would n't have the time to do anything else , because it would require me too much time .
Consider that now I study 8 hours a day at university and 6 hours a day at home .
Moreover I spend 2 hours to go to university from home : how could I find the time to study every particular aspect of every subject ?
I think I would become mad ! .
So , I think that knowing a lot of things is beautiful , but at the end it is impossible .
This is also because the university try to prepare students for the job they will do in the future .
This job usually belongs to ONE or few subjects studied at university .
So why do I have to study more and more subjects ?
I talk you about my experience .
The aim of my course is to prepare students to solve transport and logistics problems within a few time .
This is very important for us , because in this way we avoid to study some subject and instead we can concentrate on the most important ones , in other words the most `` operative '' ones , that comprehend the knowledge that actually we must have when we 'll do our job .

For all these reasons , I confirm that I completely disagree with the statement .

3538,613787.txt,P7,HIN,medium,"In school we are been though to understand ideas and concept but there are some students who lean the facts and take it the easy way out .
Most of the schools teach how it is done and why but there are some exceptions where schools teach to learn by heart .

Firstly , these schools just make them know that this is the information and they are suppose to learn it .
So such sitautions just make the student remember the fact and not know what it means and why is it like that .
The student should be tought the reasons of the subject and they should understand .
By this if for example , someone comes up and asks the students do they know the meaning of this or why it is like this , they all should be able to reply them back instead of saying no its just suppose to be that way .

Secondly , by learning the facts when the students is young it helps them as they grow up .
There are some things which have to be know as facts and not have means to it .
When they learn the teachnice to learn the facts when they are some , as they grow up the learning process increases and they can then learn facts aswell know the concept and understand the idea .

Overall , i feel that the it is important for students to understand ideas and concept aswell as learn the facts .
So by this the student will experience both and gain more information , which shall benfit later on in higher studies or after studies .

I 'm not sure about the point of part of it says `` cars in use '' .
Car is one of the most familiar goods that we need in day life .
we also can use bus or subway even the air plane but we always need a car when you try to go somewhere , even with your family .
And poeple actually thinks they needs a car for some reason .
this causes horrible traffic on the road all the time also with bad gases from the car It destroies enviroment these days .
We always want more comfortable life style with better quality that we could have .
Now days car is pretty much affordable goods .
Even though there are alot of expensive cars .
But I 'm pretty sure about the number of a car for each person who has the car would never get discrease but not everybody would drive their car everyday .
It is already enough that we going through right now with horrible traffic and bad Air .
I do n't have my own car yet but I see my parents , They have their own car but they do n't go out driving with their car all the time .
Sometimes subway is much faster than driving a car without being tired .
Basicially what I 'm saying is , the number of cars in use would never be discreased but It does n't mean that traffic would get worse than this or everybody would n't drive their car and only start using a bus or subway .
About the bad gases from cars , alot of Technicsions are working on making non-gas cars .
For example the car could run with sunshine or even water etc .
Actually I heard some one made that kind of cars already but It 's not that common for everybody .
I 'm sure There will be alot of poeple who would drive that kind of car .

3345,579792.txt,P1,KOR,high,"I strongly believe that the broad knowledge of many academic subjects is far more beneficial than the narrow view on specific subject .
There are several important reasons which undergird my position .

The first one is that the world is being complicated and interdisciplinary .
In other words , it is impossible to understand where the world is heading without the compound analysis on the various subjects .
The good example for this is bioengineeing .
In these days , the field of study , bioengineering , is getting more popular .
And its property can be defined as diversity and integrity of other various fields of the study .
It can be referred as a mountain , which is living and breathing .
All fields of engineering and science , such as Mechanical Engineering or biology , chemistry , gets together building mountain , bioengineering .
Inside it , the each fields interacts and synchronize with each other .
Without the ability which can have himself or herself understand other fields of study , they cannot participate in the interaction among fields and the living mountain cannot live anymore resulting in the collapse both personally and socially .

The second one is that broad knowledge on many academic subjects affects the individual life directly .
For example , if someone knows well about english with Mechanical Engineering major , he can teach others english as a part time job .
Also , the person who has broad band of knowledge on academic subjects can do things then others who do n't .
Someone with qualified foreign language can make connection between his or her company with others abroad .

The specialzed knowledge on one subject can make researcher deep well of study .
However , the depth of the well can be further by broader entrance of it .
The wider the entrance , the deeper the well goes .
To get their own major is , of course , important .
However , we should remember that broader knowledge can make our research more profounder and valuable .
It support strong base for your major .

Therfore , I prefer to arm with broad knowledge of many academic subfects than to specialize in one specific subject .

The present generation faces various challenges , works with too many responsibilities in a world of immense competition .
They hardly have ample time to help their communities .

Man 's life today has changed tremendously with the advancement in science and technology .
The more the changes over the years , the higher their aims have become , the greater the responsibilities to be carried out and the greater are the accomplishments to be made .
His needs have changed tremendously with advancement in technology and science .
This change has not made his life easier but also challenging to succeed .

Man irrespective of his age is working harder than what he was doing a 20 years back .
If we cosider a small kid , he too is busy with his academic schedule with a change in his syllabus , amount of material to be studied .
He hardly finds time for his co-curricular activities .
If a teenager is considered , he is busy making a career for himself .
A middle aged man is quite occupied in improving his skills or standards of living .
Its only a retired person who seemingly has time for activities but lacks enough energy .

The change in technology over the past few years has brought a change not only in man 's life making things easier for him but also in his way of thinking .
Today even a small kid thinks about what advantages he can get for sacrificing something .
Every individual is more focussed on what he or she can become , how much can he or she earn and how to make more profits .
They lead a very mechanical life where they mainly believe in the famous saying `` Time is Money '' .

They would not like to spend their time on something that doesnot benefit them in terms of money or luxury .
As considered in management science theory that man 's social needs come only after his financial needs .

In such a society people hardly think about their communities and take out some time to help their communities .

Every year in this world the number of car circulating is increasing , new countries are developing , the work 's market needs more flexibility and everyone of us want to have the freedom of going wherever and whenever we want .

If we think about China we can see that it 's trying to follow the first world with its economy so we can imagine that in the future they will follow our manners so probably they will wish as us a car for ownself and a car for their childs .
If that happen the number of the cars will be necessarily higher than now .

In addition the number of people living on earth is going to become bigger and so everyone will have his owncar .
Another problem that can increase the cars ' number is that very often the public transport system is not very useful because there are not rides during the night or the frequency of the rides is not enough or the trains and buses are so busy and owercrowded that can be a real challenge to cach them .
In addition , as happen very often in Italy ( as today ) , the public transport is not available because the workers do n't go to work to protest with the government or with the employers On the other hand the number of available parking will be ever fewer and so that can be a deterrent to reduce the cars .
In addition the request of fuel will be too much higher ( increased by the cars ' number ) and as ever happen in the market the petrol price will be so high that someone will have to leave his own car at home using public transport .

7584,1167733.txt,P7,TEL,high,"The issue stated by the topic is whether the students need to understand the ideas and concepts rather than learnin the facts alone .
This is a very important issue because it is related to the students and the application of the knowledge they have gained in their schools .
I completely agree with the statement because of various reasons .

Firstly i feel that understanding the ideas and concepts is better option because the student will be able to judge by himself whether the facts are true or not instead of asking the student to blindly follow the facts which may create confusion in them .

Secondly by getting familiar with the ideas and concepts .
the student will better understand the outcomes of them and inturn will be able to apply them correctly .
For example if the student understand the concept of gravity thorougly rather than just knowing that all the objects throw up will come down , the student is more convinced and be careful with the objects he is handeling .

Another point why i feel that understanding the ideas and concepts is the right option for students is because they can retain the facts for longer period of time .
For example if students understand how the facts have obtained instead of just what are the facts they can always apply the concepts and get facts .
But if they learn only facts then if they forget them it will be difficult to remember .

Lastly schooling is never complete if the student comes out of the educational institution with just gaining knowledge of the thing , that is just knowin facts .
If the students are not able to appy them in their daily life then there wont be any meaning for the knowledge they gained .

In conclusion i believe that student should understand the ideas and concepts thorougly thaught in their schools and not just merely learn the facts inorder to fulfil their education and inturn to evolve as a complete human being and be usefulto the society when they come out .

5224,908592.txt,P2,KOR,medium,"Basically I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

What do you think the meaning of ` enjoy ' ?
Young people can enjoy more kinds of sports than old people do because their physical condition allows more chance to do like snow board , motorcycle , mountain climbing , sky diving which are need more wild actions and physical abilities .
No one can say old people can enjoy these sports too .

The sports is one of the most important way of enjoying our life .

Furthernore old people are much more conservative than young people when they challenge something new in their life .
For example , they have to consider their family and company before challenging new things .
However young people feel more free to launching new things .
They are much bravier than old people so that they can experience more about new world eventhough they fail sometimes .
That is o.k for young people because they have plenty of time to recover their fail or mistakes .

Therefore , Young people can enjoy life more than old people .
I did n't mean old people cannot enjoy life but they have more restriction than young people .

4102,712770.txt,P3,ZHO,medium,"I agree that the young people in nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities .
There are too many factors which stop young people from helping the communities .
The young people learn to grasp what they do not at hand and search for what they want to do .
These factors leave them solely care about themselves and only deal with their own personal tasks .

First , living with the great pressure to get higer degree ends up less and less time for the young people to leave thier leisure time for the communities .
Young people tend to focus on their acdemic field achivement rather than their communities .
Thus , they spend great amount of time studying or explore the acdemic field so that they will get great degree and be qualified to pursue for their future job .

Second , with the advanced technology in this changing society , young people are more likely to be attracted by media or other information resources .
These leave the young people less time to care about the living area communities and prompt to searching for other entertainments .
Hence , young people will spend more time on theier own leisure time entertainments and try to relax after their daily work .

In a word , the rapid changing society prompt the young people to live in the moment to fullfill their dreams first .
With the growing pressure left for them to compete with others result in less and less time they devote to their communities .
For the rest of the day left from their goal pursuing mission , they would be more likely to settle down to relax and rest to save some energy for the next busy day .
Those problems they face in the reality lead them to solve their present situations and cause them only have time to think for themselves rather than others .

7401,1150446.txt,P8,TEL,high,"Why only few individuals in the society are successful ?
Why not everyone succed in their career ?
A perfect answer to this question is that not everyone try new things and take risk in their life .
People commonly opt for safe and secured paths of life .
Usually , people follow the most commonly used path and never try to explore new ways and means to get to their destination .
Very few make use of their novel ideas to acheive respective goals .
This emphasises the significance of following creative trends and taking up risky challenges to end in success .

Scientists are the living proof for stating that ` Success results from exploration and risk taking '' .
Very few turn into scientists because of their innovations and research where in they try to find out new procedures by experimenting in a different fashion other than common people who do it in an already known way .
Best example i can ever quote is about a professor in our medical school who tried to cure cancers in a different form of therapy called Brachy therapy rather than the reguraly followed modes of treatment like Chemotherapy or Surgey .
My professor experimented with the new technique built up by his ownknowledge and experience .

Students who take unrelated courses rather than regular ones may land in success soon .
In addition , they have proved that nothing is impossible if you try hard to acheive a goal .
For instance , one of my best friends registered in the courses likeTheatre recording and Video taping as soon as he finished his under graduation which is nothing but taking a risk as he is not sure of his success with his creative idea of taking a different course in his graduate studies .
However , all our classmates found his act to be surprising and concluded that he is going to end up in defeat and can never succed in his career as he opted for an irrelevant course from his undergraduate studies .
To everyones surprise , today my fried is one of the highest earners of the year by working in the Theatre recordings and Videa taping centres .

In conclusion , i personally believe that success is never sought with out exploring novel ideas and involvement of risk .
Infact , i have learnt from my personal experiences of life regarding my professor and my close friend that one has to take risk and try something new rather than following everyone in the society .

10331,1682104.txt,P2,DEU,high,"Every year we get older and older and we do n't care of the changes which happen .
We often do n't notice the alteration brought by the passing of time .
But in reality we should wonder if our life is not better when we are young .
Do n't people usually think that young people enjoy life more than older people do ?
In this essay , we are first going to show the aspects of enjoying life as an elderly person and then we are going to talk about life when we are young .

First we are considering the fact if elderly people reallz enjoy their lifes .
On the one hand , elderly people are often lonely and have few friends .
They live together in special houses where no young people are .
People in such homes often lose their pleasure in life , because they are disconnected from the outstanding world .
On the other hand elderly people are less attractive than younger people .
They have also more health trouble and are often disprised by a lot of people .
Additionally , these people always live together and see no other people .
This is why they also become more and more sad , because they notice that their are rejected by society and that nobody cares about them .

On the whole I would say that it is very difficult for elderly people to enjoy life , because they often are very lonely and have few friends who look after them .

Now we are going to see that young people can enjoy their live .
First we can say that young people meet a lot of other people .
They are always with friends , doing sport , playing games or enjoying their life .
A lot of the time is spent in places where a lot people are and this gives those people the opportunity to meet new people .
Secondly , young people are more attractive than elderly people are and they have no difficulty to find a boy-friend or a girl-friend .
They are usually good looking which causes that they can better enjoy their live .
Thirdly they are well-off , are in a good shape and health and they can do what they want .
Their strength allows them to travel all over the world and see new places .
Furthermore there are not many limits which prevent them from beeing happy , because these young people have the whole life in front of them .
These people often do n't have to worry , because their live will last for a long time .

To conclude we see that , as time goes by , we change and that these changes affect our perception of life .
When we are young we meet a lot of people , we are more attractive and we are well-off , which are all things which disappear with the fact of becoming older .
This is why I agree with the statement and find that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
"
7448,1156164.txt,P6,TEL,medium,"First of all , I agree with the statement given here that `` The best way to travel is in a group led by a fow guide ''

My first reason is , as we go to a new palce , we may not be knowing how the place will be , how will be the behaviour of the people , what their culture is , what their custumes are , whta their tradition is etc .
If we go to some american countires , we may find some difficulty , understanding their language and aslo we can not understand their accent eventhough their speak english .
For example suppose you planned to go France .
The language the people speak there is French .
You may not understand French .
Here you need a guide .

My second reason is , if the palce you planned to tour a historic place without a guide , you finally end up with the rockey structures you saw there .
As each historic place has a history behind in the main purpose of visi is to know its history .
As we are not familiar with the palce and its history , a guide it is right person to expalin it .
Fot example , take an instance os vising mahabalipuram , a famous historic site in India .
It 's all filled with temples made ofrock , carring on stone etc .
We need a guide to expalin what rocky strutures are .

And lastly the important thing is fullfilling the purpose for which have spent the money , lets suppose you have palnned an Europe tour .
But you did not have a proper person with you to expalin their what is the purpose of visiting is not knowing any thing .

11081,1816394.txt,P7,KOR,medium,"In my opinion , understanding ideas and concepts are more important than just learn facts .
Just learning facts could bring few problems to students .
First , if students just learn about the facts of any topics , they might forget them very easily , some students might not forget , because not every body has same style .
However , if they do n't understatnd ideas or concepts , they will forget when they do n't study facts for a while and try to study again .
It is why understanding ideas is important , if they understand ideas and concepts , they wo n't forget them easily .

Second , it is very hard to learn facts without understanding ideas or concepts .
Especially , for young students like elementray to middle school , they need to understand ideas before they learn facts , because most of thing they learn in school for example are the stuffs that they never heard about .
Therefore , if they just learn facts and not understanding ideas and concepts , they will get hard time in later like high school or college , even they still remember the facts .

Third , they cannot discuss about the thing that they learned , if they only know about the facts , because they would n't know what they should discuss about , for example , students learn about the facts of soda , they ca n't discuss what are the pros of soda and what are the cons of soda .
They only know that what is the soda .

To get better knolwedge , those are the why they should understand ideas and concepts of the topic they learn .
However , I would like to say the facts are very important too to know things , because students could know specificaly about the thing they learn with facts .
Therefore , My opinion is understand ideas and concepts are more important and the first thing to get before learn the facts .

1490,247891.txt,P3,FRA,medium,"i totally agree with this sentence : young people nowadays do mot give enough time to helping teir communities .
But why young people don t give enough time to helping their communities ?
In first , we are going to see that young people nowadays are busier and have a lot a thing to do .
At last we will analyze the fact that young people are more concentred on themselves .

First of all , nowadays , young people have very busy .
Indeed they have a lot of thing to do like doing sport , shopping , going to cinema , doing some trips , calling friends , organizing some parties ..

Their life is different today because the generation changed .
The society changed too and the mentalites too .
That s why the free time that young people is more interested tahn before because they can do a lot of thing , more than before .
they are busy to do other thing than to helping their communities .
Then , maybe it s not their fault but just a modification of the society ( more modern ) .
Before , young people haven t a lot of thing to do that s why there were concentred on their communities .

Moreover , it s not the only reason .
Young people nowadays are more concentred on themselves that is to say they don t think to help the others , for example in helping teir communities .

Because of their eductaion too , they cannot think about the communities .
Parents don t learn the real value of communities that s why they don t know what it s talking about .

Young people complain about a lot of thing but they don t know that nowadays their life are easier than before and funnier .
According to me , young people should more thinking about the others and should learn how they can share with people and be more open .

To conclued , i can say that this problem could be arranged if parents take care about it .
Young people have to make up their minds to be more accesible .
According to me , young people should in first be more open and this could changed a lot of things .
"
10891,1780915.txt,P2,DEU,medium,"I think the answers has to be no .
Young people do just have a different way to enjoy life and other purposes .
Younger people want to get independent and explore life .
They need to get experience in order to find the their way of life .
A thirteen year old girl for example enjoys to go out with here girlfiends , do something crazy or forbidden , which will help her to get to know the people and things she likes .
Young people do also frequently change their opinion about what they actually like and therefore enjoy in life .

Older people have more experience and they do normally know what they like and what not .
So in contrary to younger people the enjoying of life is something more consistent for older people .
They may just be grateful to be able to sit in a park and watch the doves in order to enjoy life .
But this does n't mean that the old man sitting in the park enjoys this experience less than a thirteen year old smoking a cigaret in her closet .

This leads to another important fact .
In my point of few it depends on the personal preferences of the person .
The age is hereby irrelevant .
So it may even be that the old man from the park has the preferances of a thirteen year old and loves to go to rock concerts .

There is one fact which makes it easier for older people to enjoy life : money .
Since most of the older people have a profession and work for money they have more opportunities to enjoy things in life than a student who has to get a long with a view dollars a month .
Also by reaching the legal age of 18 ( in Germany ) there are again more possibilities to enjoz oneself as an adult .

So to sume up : There is no indicator which of the mentioned group enjoy life more than the other .
To many factors influence this impression .
Although the older people have a stight advantage of having money and a driving lisc

8539,1343388.txt,P1,TEL,high,"There is a famous aphorism that says `` Jack of all trades but master of none '' .
I agree with this saying and hence donot think that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .

Instead , one should specialize in a single subject .
Firstly , in today 's dog-eat-dog world , it is important for a person to get ahead in the rat race .
Specializing in a single subject helps an individual to have exclusive knowledge of that subject and hence he will secure more lucrative offers in the field of employment .
The demand increases and the supply being less , the individual is rewarded amply for his spcialization .
Also , there is an abundance of academic topics to choose from and very little time to pay total attention to them .
Gaining knowledge about many subjects is simply impractical .

Secondly , if a person concentrates on myriad subjects at the same time , unless he is an exceptionally brilliant individual , there are chances of his getting overwhelmed with the sheer diversity in the subjects that he has to deal with .
For instance , it is a widely known fact that Leonardo Da Vinci was a true genius and had mastered various fields ranging from science to art , which is evident in his works ; from model aircrafts , to bridges , to the `` Vetruvian man '' , to `` Mona Lisa '' .
This goes to show that unless an individual is confident about his capabilities , that is he can deal with a vast number of subjects like Da Vinci did , he should not bite off more than he can chew .

Also , from the scientific view point , the average human brain can process only a limited amount of information at a time and that too about a certain number of topics .
Though it is proven that we use only 10 % of our brain capacity , why not focus the remaining 90 % on a single subject and master it ?
Dealing with too many topics at one time could lead to confusion and chaos and could result in frustration for the individual .

Moreover , If a person has specialized knowledge about a particular subject , he can work in collaboration with specialists from other fields , hence enabling him to socialize as he simultaneously distributes his knowlede to others .
In this process he also gains knowledge of other fields .

Finally , I think that a person should have a basic awareness and not a thorough knowledge of as many subjects as he possibly can .
In this day and age , specialization is the key to a successful academic , professional and social life .

8189,1273447.txt,P2,KOR,medium,"I agree with the statement ` Young people enjoy life more than older people do . '
There were two main reason for agreeing this statement .
They were ` variation of choice ' and ` passionate ' .

For the first reason , young people can have more choice than older people do .
Usually older people have less opportunity than young people have because of their age and also they have bad health than young do .
Also when older get hurt , they are recovered slower than young do because of older 's cells are too old reproduce themselves .
This cause older 's choices became limited .
For example , oldies cannot ride a ski or snow board as youth people do dangerous trick because they have more risk than young riders have .

For the second reason is related with passionate .
Young people usually have more passion than old people do .
For the reason of this , it is because of hormones and the different amount of experience .
Old people have less hormones than young guys have and hormones is one of scientific catalyst that made exciting to the brain .
For the result of this , even if young and old people do sex with a same situation , their excitement are different because of amount of hormones .

For passionate , amount of experience also affect a lot .
Usually beginner has more exciting than veteran does .
For example of this , when two different type of people have same girl friend , the amount of excitings are different between ladies guy and the person who never had girl friend because ladies guy already has experience about having girl friend .
This relationship does not change a lot between old people and young people because old people usually have more experience than youth people have .

Old people can also enjoy the life , but young people usually can get more exciting or enjoyness from same activities .
They caused from a lot of reason and some of them based on scientific data and psychological data .
However , this does n't mean old people ca n't enjoy their life even if the exciteness is different with youth group , they still can enjoy their life .

6396,1059344.txt,P8,SPA,medium,"`` Life is just one , and we have to substract from it all as we can '' , I mentioned and used that phrase all my life .
Since I was a kid , I understood that I have goals , the ones that made me work and continue through school and college .
I experienced a lot of things , which made me the man I am today .
I took risks during that time , like moving from my town to get a better education , but at the same time I continue with the same goals and doing what I did best , maths and sciences .

I understand that people do both , they take risks , while they do what they know how to do well .
For example , a story about a guy that knows how to sell TV 's to people .
After doing that for a long-time period for a `` X '' company , he realized that he could do that kind of job with his own company , and he quit the job .
Then he started his own company named with his son 's name .
Thats was the huge risk he took but he understood that people like him had choices , and that he will be success because he knows how to do the job .

With that story , an integrationg of risks and experiences can be observed .
He do know where he is good at , and he use that to try new things .
My experience tell me , that I should integrate both , while they are acceptable .
My life is made about experiences , and each day I take risks to keep living .

Overall , I do not agree with the statement `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .
People are the owners of your actions , and the success will depend on it .
A person can be success by just doing what they know how to do , or by trying new things , which will take them again to the point of doing what they know how to do .

I know that my future is around scieces , but I do know that I have to take risks to achieve my proffesional goal , be a Meteorologist .
I have to move from my home-country , knowing that is for my own good .
Thats the bigest risk I will experience next year , while at the same time I know how to talk to people , make new friends , and take the best from every opportunities I encounter .
Success is around the courner and should experience it with new things or by just doing what they do best .

4868,848395.txt,P6,FRA,high,"Travelling is the greatest opportunity one can have .
It opens up new horizons , exposes you to different cultures and opens you to a realm of exciting possibilities , all necessary to make you more open minded and a better human being .

Some say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
I strongly disagree with this way of travelling .
Though it has the advantage of making the planning of the trip easier , as well as showing you the major attractions of an area in a short period of time , its negative points are too great to be ignored .

Travelling in a group means that you have to follow a planned schedule .
Now we all know that different people have various interests , and this limits you in experiencing and seeing what you are really interested in .
Also , travelling is not suppose to be routine , you should be able to decide where you want to go and when , and be able to change your intinerary according to how you are feeling that day , or depending on the weather , etc .

It is true that you do get to see the main attractions of an area when travelling in a group , but you do n't get to experience the culture of the country your are visiting .
Being surrounded by a group of people who roughly share your culture and social status does n't leave a lot of room to meet locals , be immersed in a different language , explore spots that are n't major tourist attractions , discover the cuisine of the country or it 's every day traditions .

Having traveled a lot , I believe that the best way to travel is without an itinary or a plan , being flexible and deciding your schedule according to who you meet along the way , your discussions with locals , your interests and your feelings .
Is n't that what travelling is all about , discovering a new area and culture and learning more about yourself along the way ?

284,50229.txt,P3,FRA,high,"In our society , young people tend not to spend a lot of time helping their communities , and that is due to the society in which we live .
Indeed , we observe at the moment a sort of individualism , which is expressed by the fact that people tend to live by themselves without taking care of their neighbours , acting like sheeps .

Young people used to care for other people , but that was what the society told them to do .
Nowadays , the matter is not that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities , it is just that they do not have time to do so since our society is based on work and money .

How could it be possible for young people to care for communities when they have barely time to take care of themselves .
It is true that more and more young people live their lives according to their personal needs , which is kind of hypocrite in a way , but one has to admit that our society does not help young people very much .

On one hand , studying is becoming more and more expensive .
If you are courageous enough to make your dreams come true , you can try to find a job in order to finance your studies , but this does not seem normal .
On the other hand , you have some countries where studies are paid by the government , as it is the case in Denmark for instance .
In Scandinavia , one can notice that people and especially young people care for others , take part into helping communities .
In brief , they are deeply involved in their society , willing to help in order to make things go better .

In a nutshell , I would say that the young people 's investment in their communities is closely related to the society they live in .
If young people have to bear adults ' role in life when they are not adults yet , I do not see how possible it is for them to get involved in their communities .

719,115743.txt,P8,TUR,medium,"I agree this statemen .
Successful people try new things because they want to get new degree .
There are several reason for this .

All people who have alot of achievement do n't satisfied to try new thing .
As their ambitious force them a new achievement , they want to learn new things even if it is risky .
They consider taking a risk about one different thing they did n't know before about it because this kind of people do n't like monotone life .
In my opinion , this kife is better than the other .
Trying to new thing adds to our lifes numerous new concepts .
For example , I like playing soccer .
When I was in my country , I played soccer every weekend .
After for a while , I bored to play soccer .
I want to change someting in my life style .
Before I came US , I did n't know about American football .
Now I am learning about it .
I also like it , I learn several new rule about sport , so it encourage me to play it .
The other example about risky .
I had took phd education for two year in my country .
I want to change my education place even if it has many riskies .
These are spending alot of money , passing the toefl exam , and complete a new phd education in US .
They did't know how much money I spend before .
I also did't know Whether or not I will pass the toelf an complete a new education .

3840,665880.txt,P2,KOR,medium,"Although I think I am young , I can not enjoy my life because of lack of money and time .
I had to study hard to attend a good university since I was a child .
After graduating from university , I also had to get a job to earn money for living .
As a result , I disagree that young people enjoy their lives than older people do because of lack or money and time .
I think that the older can enjoy life more .

First of all , the older have more money than the young .
we need money to do something .
If I like reading novels , I have to buy books .
If I like a travel , I have to buy a car or buy a expensive airline ticket for going abrod .
Because of this money problem , I can not often travel abroad .
However , my parents used to go abroad for their enjoyment because they are rich .
They have enough nomey to buy expensive tickets and to pay for luxury hotel room .
I am envious his welth , so I am working hard to earn more money .

Secondly , young people have no enough time to enjoy their lives .
when they were child , they have to study hard .
Because their parents want to go more high repuataional university , they have spend all time to study .
They also have no time after graduating from university .
Because tuition fee of university is very expensive , the young people would have a lot of depths after graduation .
After all , they have to work hard for the depths and then for marriage and for their children .
In contrast , old people would have a lot of time if many old people already retired .
Thus , old people were not worry about lack of time .

In conclusion , although young people have more high physical power than older people , young people can not enjoy their life more than the old people because young people have no enough money and time .
As a result , I disagree that the young enjoys life more than the old does .
I think that when young people work hard , they can be seen a good people .

7562,1165565.txt,P6,ZHO,medium,"The answer of this statement depends on personal life exxperience and different culture background .
Some people agree with travelling in a group meanwhile others have a negative attitude .
Howere , in my part , I prefer to make my trip alone than in a group as my inclination .
Among countless reasons , there are two conpicuous aspects as follows .

The main reason why I disagree with the statement is that it is not helpful for cultural exchange .
If you join a group you can only go to the places which the tour guid lead s you to and hve no free time to communicate with the local people .
IN contrast , travelling alone you get the access to the local people ' s life and culture .
Trought talinking and living with them , you hcan shre different culture and perspectives on life .
That will only present you a new culture or tradition of life , also cast a new light on your old viewpoints on the culture and world .

there is another reason deserves some words here .
Travelling in a group led by tutor is a waste of money in some conditions .
Becuase the guide depends on the money you spent on the trip to survive .
They usually convice the traveller things that have no value become the necessarities and buy them .
In contrast , If trvalling along a person can use computer to get the information about the unkown place .
Through internet a traveller can find things they rreally need , such as local tasty food , the ticket for museums and other basic necessiries .
They save money and spend for the trip .

Of coures , travelling in a group also have a couple of advantagges .
In some areas , travelling with a tour guid is much safer than alone .
And safe is the foudation of every trip .
But the disadvantages carry more with than advantages .
BAsed on the aboe reasons , I can easily come the conclusion that I disagree with make the trip in a group led by tour guid .

5480,960227.txt,P1,FRA,medium,"I think to be specialised in one specific subject is good , but is not enough for your personnal development .
First of all , I think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because it is better to improve your communication with people .
I mean , if your knowledge is really broad , you will certainly be able to talk about a lot of differents subjects with a lot of different people .
Being open minded in your knowledge leads you , most of the time , of being open minded socially .
It is important to be interested in several things , that shows your ability to adapt yourself to different situations , and i do believe that being able to adapt yourself to a given situation is always a good point ; whatever you actually want to do in life .

Furthermore , the more you learn , the more you want to learn ( and need to learn actually ) .
The wilingness to learn can be found if you are specializing in one specific subject , but a single subject may leads you to isolate youself in technical considerations that non one can actually understand , whereas plurality of subject makes your mind breath .
It is no longer a question of ` academic '' knowledge , it is a question of curiosity .
According to me , acknowlegment goes the same way as it goes for food , that is to say if you eat the same food everyday , you will just be quickly disgusted .
Therefore , if you just study one single subject , even if you go deeply through it , you will be disgusted one day somewhat .

To summarize , I rekon it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because you can thus talk about more things , and it makes you so much curious as if you were majoring in one specific subject .
I agree to say that learning about a specific subject is a good think , because everything can not be superficial in your life , but if you have only that in your life , that not enough to make this one fun

It is n't enough for me to do only some part of it .
I think , for getting a success it is very important to complete the job .
Eveybody wants to have broad knowledge but there is an important point , do you specialize on it or do you know only a part of it .

In daily life , there is lots of people who are trying to talk about a subject whether they have a knowledge about it or not .
I do n't agree with it .
If I do n't have a knowledge about a subject , I wo n't talk on it , I will only listen people to get their ideas and learn something about this subjects .

6322,1053038.txt,P3,ARA,high,"I totally disagree with the statement , even though oneself may believe that it is true to a certain extent because of the fact that young people love to play and no certain entity holds them responsible for their actions and the consequences of their actions .
The following are the reasons and examples that explain why I strongly disagree with the statement mentioned in the question .

Firstly , if we examine some of the extracurricular programs offered at elementary and high schools around the world , we will find that many of these programs are devoted to helping local communities .
These programs include activities such as ; cleaning side roads , collecting charitable donations and different socially responsible endeavours .
Based on a research conducted by a leading consulting firm in Europe , it was shown that 5 % of a young person 's time is being dedicated to assisting their local communities .

Secondly , social responsibility and helping communities is becoming a very hot topic in the corporate world .
This phenominon has extended its effect to outside of the corporate world to invlove the rest of the society .
Therefore , many people are becoming more aware of the importance of being socially responsible , hence , they are starting to convey the benefits of being socially responsible to younger people ( i.e. their kids , students , dependents . ..
etc . ) .

Finally , many young people groups are being used as great examples of time dedication in helping communities .
Not only their communities , but also international communities .
For example , a group of kids from France have gathered their toys and other belongings and sent them to Lebanon to help the kids who have left their homes because of the current Israeli-Lebanese war .

11391,1873223.txt,P5,SPA,high,"I agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
First of all , I think that the people today worry much more for the envioronment than in the past .
The goverment and associations such as Green Peace try to get people involved to protect our planet and in my opinion their are achieving their purpouse .
There are lots of people that go to work in bus and other public ways of transport , or share a car with other people to go to work every day .
The governments in some countries are also trying to control the pollution by laws and restrictions such as not allowing to drive cars one day or another depending on the number plate .

Another fact that I think will influence on the decrease of the number of cars in use is their price and the price of gas .
Young people that start their first job do n't earn enough to buy a car and to pay for gas every month .
I think the priority for them is to buy a house and since these are really expensive they do n't think about buying a car .

On top of this , going by car to a big city is a huge waste of time because there is always a lot of traffic .
For example , my friend Ana has to leave home at half past seven in the morning to go to work , but she does n't start until nine o'clock .
After the hard day of work she leaves at half past six in the afternoon , but she does n't get home until eight o'clock .
She wastes three hours every day on the road !

4408,764880.txt,P3,KOR,high,"I do n't agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I think the young people nowadays do n't seem to be giving enough time to help , only because the people who say that fail to correctly observe what the young people can do , and are doing to help .
They expect the help to be in a certain form , and they fail to see that the young people are giving help because the help of nowadays may not be in that form .

For an example , let 's say there is a child with a rare blood type .
This child has somehow lost a lot of blood , and need a large amount of transfusion .
But because he has such a rare blood type , him and his parents are having a hard time finding enough blood in the hospital , and need a living donor as soon as possible .
When young people of today find out that there is someone like this , they take actions to help using new means of action , for example , by posting an ad on their internet homepages , or sending out e-mails to all the people they know , to go and donate blood if any one who sees the ad has the same rare blood type .
If the child does find the right donor in time this way , I 'll say that this is a good way of giving time to help someone in the community .

What I want to say is that if the observers expect the help to be only in some physical form , such as going out to sweep the neighborhood , they wo n't be able to see this kind of help , and they will be apt to judge the young people to be not helping .

The world is rapidly changing .
If we observe the young people of nowadays using the standards that are decades old , they might appear to be not caring about their communities .
But if we give a moment to understand the world now , and to compare and see how different the lives of today and ten years ago are , we will be able to see that the young people of nowadays

1072,176239.txt,P5,TEL,medium,"The statement is In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
One group of people agree with this statement and one group of people donot agree with the statement .
I find many reasons for not agreeing with the statement .
I personally donot agree with the statement .

Yes , technology is developing day by day but this does not necessarily mean that there will be no cars in twenty years .
This is unpredictable .
Now a days people are working hard and are making their lives comfortable that is they are acquiring everything they need .
What makes life more comfortable ?
the answer is having more luxuries and having more comforts .
People are more concentrating on luxuries which includes mobiles for communication , vehicles that is cars , bikes for transport , own houses for living and so on .
So people buy vehicles bikes , scooters , cars etc .
Most luxurious of all is Car .
Not only luxurious , it is safer than many other vehicles .
So buying cars will definitely increase that is there will be many cars in use in twenty years .
These reasons donot support with the statement .

secondly , people are trying to reach the goals above their standards .
For example a person using a two wheeler vehicle , even though it is hard for him to buy a car , keeps his goal of buying a car due to various reasons .
Some of them are for avoiding pollution and accidents .
They feel having a car is far better than having other vehicles .
The main reason is Car is affordable .
And moreover now a days cars with electric facilities ars available that is having gas engines .
This is safer because it doesnot lead to pollution .
Therefore , using cars is day by day increasing .

For all these reasons which are discussed above , i donot agree with the statement that fewer cars will be in use than there are today .
I strongly believe that there will be no attrition in the use of cars in twenty years and there will be more number of cars in use than there are today in twenty years .

431,76891.txt,P8,ITA,medium,"I absolutely agree with this statement , I think that everybody that wants to be a successful person at work but also in his private life needs to try always something new and take some risks .
I also think that to reach some success in life somebody has to take his responsibilities , for what he thinks or does , and must have the very difficult ability to learn from other people and from himself .

Trying new things , means for me a need of changing , a sensation that what 's surrounding is not big enough , but I also think that the first step for trying new things starts from the inside of everybody , such as trying new feelings .

Taking the risks is also very important because if anybody arrives to the success without any risk or stop it 's success does n't mean anything .
The responsibilities are one of the most important part of the success , because when you take some decisions for your future you must be able to face the problem that this decisions will cause you , and if you can manage well your decisions and your responsibilities you can also fail but with a smile on your face .

To reach the success I think it 's important also the ability to learn , and I do n't mean only from other people but also to learn from ourselves and from our mistakes , and not to think that we already know what to do and nobody else does because there will always be someone else that that already committed the same mistake and that can teach us something to find our solution .

If we only do what we can do well we 'll never be able to follow our path but we 'll only walk around in circle .

7024,1116626.txt,P7,TUR,medium,"I agree with the statement .
It is more important to understand the ideas and concepts .
Learning the facts without understanding the bottom line of it does n't make sense .
It does n't help people to improve themselves and derive the point from the facts .
For example learnin about science , if we do n't know the basic idea behind the fact we never get the connection between the releated facts .

Besides if we dont teach our students the concepts behind the facts we would just developed a banch of encylopedias for future not an efficient and smart generation .
They have to know reasons , factors , consequences and developments about the facts .
Only knowing the fact does n't stand for much .
There is some before the fact and there is some after the fact .
If they know both part , it makes sense and draw a picture in their mind .
It will fly and never stable in mind without it .

Also it is really necessary for students to know concepts behind the facts to make it easier them to understand easily .
Think about it .
When they are learning gravity , if you dont explain the factors , reasons and just tell them the ground pulling us through what they would understand .
Probably nothing .

In conclusion , humans always look for reasons , results and factors .
They want to know why ?
So for students it s important to know ideas and concepts .

7336,1144441.txt,P5,TEL,medium,"I will disagree that there will be fewer cars in use in the next twenty years .
I can give the following reasons for my opinion .
Firstly , the population of the world is increasing exponentially .
This will increse the the need of transport .
When viewed in detail about majority of the countries , the chief means of transport is car .
As per to satisfy the needs of growing population the usage cars will definitely increase in the near future which can be a good reason to contradict the statement

The second reason is the declination in cost of car .
When studied about the statatics from the time of invention of car .
The cost of cars is declined to a larger extent .
This made cars available to the large middle class societies in the world .
Since the economic and financial status of the people are incresing the middle class societies also incresing .
This mens the need of car is also incresing .
This combines the declining prices of car and the usage of car will be incresed .
This means that in the near future the usage of car will be further incresed .

Nowadays cars are manufactured which runs on battery .
So , eventhough shortage of the petroleum resources will never reduce the usage of the cars .
Car has become the comfortable transport ..
The comfortability will increase with the advancements in the technology furthermore , which makes people to use cars as their chief means of transport .
Also cars are safier to travel when compared to bikes and cycles .

In view of the above reasons I believe that the usage of car will never decrease in the next twenty years .

5898,1016883.txt,P7,KOR,medium,"I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understanding ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
It is true that learning fact is important but not importan than ideas and concepts .

As my experience , most of the professor gives test based on the ideas and concepts of the what we learned .
purpose of testing is the how much students gets ideas and concepts of the content and how to apply it .
None of my professor wanted the students to get pass the class without understanding ideas and concepts .

According to Korean Newspaper , most succeceful students are getting ideas and concepts of the subject , not the facts .
Reseachers tested experiment in one high school .
They had fifty people were studied only concepts and ideas , and fifty student were studied only facts .
The result of the experiment was forty out of fifty students who were in the idea and concepts group got A 's and ten out of fifty students who were in the facts group got A 's in the test .

After reading this researchers paper i focus on the understanding ideas and concepts of the contents .
As a result my grades were higher than studying facts .
I think understand ideas and concepts is more important that learning a facts .
Just getting a good grade is not the good point for the student .
Student have to understand ideas and concepts and walk one step forward to the feature .

8785,1387789.txt,P5,JPN,high,"I agree to the statement that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today for three reasons .
Thinking of the polluted air and the growing width of the ozone halles , the number of cars must be reduced whether we like it or not for the survival of the global citizens .

First of all , we have to improve the condition of the polluted air .
In developing countries , such as China and Korea , they have a growing number of automobiles , which causes even worse air pollution .
Also developed countries , such as the United States , have as great numbers of cars as before , as they are used to the convenient way of life with automobils .
However , we have to have clean air to survive on the earth .
If we continue to live in this polluted air , much more people would die because of polluted air .
We have to do something for the betterment of human beings .

Secondly , there will be less amount of petral available to keep the cars running .
Oil is not sustainable resource and it will be used up if we keep using it .
To obtain enough amount of oil , there will be more cases of international conflicts and wars .
Therefore we have to think of alternative ways of transportation , such as public transportation , car sharing , and even walking to work .

Thirdly , the number of people who can buy a car will decrease because of widening of the gap between the rich and the poor .
These days , the rich get richer and the poor get poorer , and unfortunately , the number of the poor outnumber the rich in many cases .

This is why I have to agree that we must reduce the number of cars in twenty years , although I now indulge the luxury of driving to work .
I really have to think of what I can do to improve this environmental issue of the world .

5474,959192.txt,P4,ITA,low,"we are in the XXI century and now I must write about the most advertisements that make products seem much better than they rally are .
I agree whit this idea because often many products that the people watch on tv or see around them , do not appear what they really are .
In fact I thinck that the television introduces different ideas in the head of people .
For example some people buy only shoes or the dress or gadgets that are sign by important Many people do not know what is the true , because some products are good and have hight qualty .
We can value these products for the material they are build , for their aspect , for their end .

The apparence is most important but I thinck that is not the most important element of vatulation , but for many people it is the only element of confronte some objects .

This idea is rediculeus because the apparence is not all in the life of the people .
For example , I am an architect , when I make a proget for a house I thinck that this house must be confortable , beautiful , faschion , and help the people in the life .
It must be the hause of live not only a beautiful house .
By the way many people do not understand that a house or another kinds of products are good when each elements that compose the product must be in the sit good .

10272,1669741.txt,P5,ITA,medium,"I-m agree with the statement and I really hope so .
I think that in twenty years a lot of thinghs must change and the use of cars is obsolutely one of these .
Considering first the main problem > the price and the disponibility of petrol .
In twenty years maybe some giaciments will be empty and the new one more and more unusefull becouse of the revalities between the east and the west of the world .

SO if the price of petrol is too hight we can-t use the car , is too expensive for a family have two or three cars ...
so become only one .
Another important reason to get fewer the number of cars is the pollution !
if the number of cars continue to encrase we will be summersed by smog , smokes and poisons !
isn-t possible to live in a world more sick than this .

I think also that inthe 2026 all towns will have new kind of busses and trains more conforteble , cheaper and faster than the actual one .
So to go to the work , to go out for a pizza or to do anithing else you will take the underground not like now .

Infect a lot of towns don-t have underground an the most of people don-t fell safeful taking it !
For example i-ve been in japan , to Kyoto and i can surely say you that there wasn-t traffic !!
all by bicycle or by train !
So you can go aroud and not hear the noise of the cars and without sniff their smells !
I rally hope that in all the world people can enjoi their country , can live in town without problem and expecially that all economical and en problems close to petrol will desappear !
I give you 20 years of time

3368,583905.txt,P4,ITA,medium,"Surely most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are .
We have always to remember that behind any advertisement , when we watch tv , when we listen to the radio , or just when we walk in the street , there has been a deep and accurate research to make the people like that product .

It 's not just a matter of what is the product , what is possible to do with it or if it is definitely the best in the market , there is people studying and working to find out how to make it impressive .

The advertisements work !
And so , or we believe that the products that we see in tv are really better than the otehrs or we believe that the companies want to show it in a better way .

Sometimes the companies create advertisements even nice to watch , trying to create in our mind a nice picture of the product .
Every day in tv it 's possible to find examples , it happened to me to notice that even for product that are proved to be harmful for the health as cigarettes or drinks , the association is always with something positive , beautiful or cool .
Why ?
For sure because nobody would buy something is not attracted by and because a brilliant image is much more attractive , and this makes us think about the positive sides of the products .
In this way we will go to buy what we have seen even if another product has the same qualities .

4002,694920.txt,P5,ITA,medium,"I think that there is only a little chance that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than today for a lot of reasons .
First of all today cars or similars ( trucks , bus etc . )
are the most common way to transport everything , people or materials and there are a lot of roads ( like highways ) destinated only for cars and it will be a very big problem to change all the system that we use in few years and I am sure that twenty years are fewer time than the time we need to make this change .
onother evidence of this is that the selling of cars is not in a decrease .

I think it 's possible that , beacause of the problems related with the decrease of petroleum reserves and the rise of gas cost , cars will change and they will use some alternative resources to function ; Biological and refreshable resources like wind , Sun or hydrogen are the future of the transport problem but today I think they are only a future far from us .
The thing that is also possible is that the way to use cars change .
Today we see al lot of cars in every roads that contains only one person .
For example there are often a lot of cars that are obliged to go very slow beacause there are more cars then a street could contain ; i take the bus every day to go to the university and I know very well this bad situation .
A way to change this think is to use more public services , like bus or train , but I know that they do not work very well so people prefer to take the car .

One other way to change this is to organize people to have cars full of them and not with only the driver .
I definitly think that in twenty years there will be more cars or the same as today beacause to reduce the number of cars you have to change the mind of the people , and this is very hard to do in a few years .

For instance , there are lots of advertisements about lossing how much weight in a certain shrort period of time .

8686,1367579.txt,P1,ITA,medium,"I do n't agree with this statement .
Of course you need a little of broad knowledge , especially to be able to talk and understand when you speak with people that are specialized on other fields , but you need to be specialized in one specific subject to do well your work , because you need to know that really well , and it 's impossible to be specialized about everythings .
Also if you know just a specific subject there is really a lot to know .
For example , I am a psychologist and there are a lot of fields I could work , like developmental , clinical , health , evaluation and others .
But everyone of this need a lot of theory and models to know and a lot of experiences to do , that take years to be really prepared in just one of these subjects .
But after all the training if someone has a problem about what you have specialized you can be sure that you can give him the best support , that you can help him in the best way because you know what you are talking about .
Instead if you just know a little about everything you ca n't be really helpful but you can just tell to the people where going , usually a specialized centre , to have all the information they need [ that is doing counseling ] .
After my degree I worked three years in a department of neuropsychology and until now I ca n't say that I know that subject because it 's really wide , so when someone has a neuropsychological problem needs to talk with another one that did a lot of years studing and working in that field , that knows all the acquired brain pathologies and all the tests to do the right diagnosis and that knows also about the rehabilitation , and that is able to explain to the relatives what is going on .
Of course I do n't want to say that you have to know just about one subject , but that you have to be specialized about one subject and know , i.e. in a less specific way , about many .

1621,273464.txt,P3,JPN,medium,"I agree with the idea that young people do not support their local community nowadays .
There are two reasons why the young do so .
First of all , the mobility of young people is supported by the economic power of their family .
Long ago , typical Japanese life depends on their local community .
Under these circumstance , young people can easily help their local community because they are familiar with that region and have many friends and neighbors .
In these days , young people tend to move for the seek of their ideal universites .
They are isolated in the new region because no one knows him or her and no one informs them of the content of the activity held by the new community .
This is the one of the reason why people keep a certain distance from the communities .

Another reason is that that young people seems to be not interested in the activities of the local community .
There are various jobs and attractive activities in the country and even above the country .
While the activities of local community are still the same , new jobs are apt to enchant the curiosity of the young .
For example , in our city , the event of local community is the volunteer activity for local elder people , but our university look also looks for students who help the poor children in other country .
If the cost and time and other condition is the same , it is obvious which is more attractive for students .
In fact , our university hold many attractive program like this throughout a year .

As I mentioned so far , young people do not spend their time in helping their community because of their mobility and their low attentions .
And these tendencies will progress more rapidly in our future with the advent more attractive jobs and other international activities .

10619,1731030.txt,P7,HIN,medium,"The author 's assertion that - `` it is more important to understand the concepts and ideas rather than learn facts '' , i partially agree with the saying .
True understanding of any subject is to be said - when all the ideas and the purpose should be clearly known but how one can imply thes into practicality ?
For this to be done , an individual has to learn the facts supporting the ideas .
They work as a pack and package to acheive completeness .

An example which supports the notion that understanding gives the bases of any subject which can further be expanded to opt for the research in any particular field .
For-example one has learned all the dates and origin of any technology as well as how does it works but do not know any thing about the concept and logic regrding how it works ?
Then this might not lead problem for the instance now but later when some drawbacks comes in the technology and need to be modified this time all knowledge would appear to be mere waste .

Furthe , while watching a television one might not have information about what are the characteristics of a picture tube or how the quality can be improved because we are interested in learning only fact how to operate in order to fulfill our desire for entertainment but if we understands the funtionality then this might help in improving and getting more better picture quality .

Furthermore , this can be clearly understood by the illustration that , for a mathematics student it is necessary to understand the concepts and idea related to a topic but one cannot imply those concepts without learning the facts .
Here the facts implied to the formulas which is mandatory to learn to get a solution .
Concepts and idea sometimes sufficient to deal efficeiently with the problem but it might take longer time than employing formula which is a short-cut method to reach the answer .
But sometimes gap of formula can be filled from the concept but vice-versa is not true in order to make it empirical .

To conclude , it is true that in some ways concepts and ideas outways the facts but the their worth cannot be reduced to minimal because facts needed to strengthen the concept and idea .
It actually enhances and broden the knowledge of the subject .
The two things are like our both hands .
One cannot measure the significance of one over another .

8097,1254592.txt,P6,JPN,medium,"The good way of the group travelling with a tour guide is that the group touring is makes travel funny .
We can meet many people who have n't meet yet , and we can also be friends .
And if I have tour group we can talk each other about place we went and could discuss about it .

Also if I go to truvel with a tour guide she will teach us about good place , good restaurant , and lots of other things .
It might be very good things for us .
Thats because if that place we travel is unknown country , we do n't know where is here and also we ca n't speak language .
When that happen if we have a tour guide , she will set up all thing that we need for us and surely she will presentate place where we travel correctly and truely .

The good way of travelling yourself is that you can go to anywhere you want , but if I go to travel with group it might not be true .
Example , if I want to go to Dysney Land , but the tour guide said we will go to Univertial Studio so you should follow them .

That means I think you can choose group travelling or yourself travelling in the stuation like if you want travel with many people , you can go with group .
When you want travel all around freedom , you can go to travel yourself .

3331,577738.txt,P7,DEU,high,"I defenitly agree that it is more important for students to unterstand the ideas and concepts they have to learn than just to learn facts .
There are different reasons for my opinion and I will point out 3 of them .

The first point , I want to mention is that it is easier to learn and remember things , when you understand what you learn .
For example if you study without understanding the ideas there is the probability to fail in an exam because you are not able to reproduce the problem correctly and you can not be good in tests about transferring different information to a new point of view .
So it is not very useful to learn facts by heart , it is more important to get the whole situation .

Another point is that you should be able to connect diffferent information to understand the whole problem and I think this ability is not improved by learning single aspects of a problem .
Facts can change but the main ideas , for example the theories of Milton Friedman will be true even in ten years .
And you will need these thearies to understand different processes .

My last and most important point is that you learn for life and not for school or university .
That means that the lectures and texts in university are important and the knowledge which you should aquire are necessary to succed later in your job .
University education prepares you for yours tasks later in your work life , but if you just learn stupid facts and do not use the offered knowledge , there is a high probability that you will fail .
You must be able to solve a problem and I do not think that facts and figures will help you at your job .
If you need facts in your job , you can use primary and secondary data , for example to launch a research , which will get you the facts you need .

So all in all I prefer that students should learn complete thories and no single aspects .
On the one hand that is more difficult but on the other hand you will aquire much more timeless knowledge

3555,617929.txt,P6,JPN,medium,"The statement said that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
I disagree with the statement because if you travel by a tour guide , we can not learn as much as individual travel .

First , if we travel by a tour guide , we can not go everywhere we want to .
Because the tour guide has a plan and also we can not spend as much as we want in one place .
We have to fallow the tour guider everytime .
Sometimes we can not go to the place that we want .
If we go travel by ourself , we can go to the place everywhere we want .
Also we do not have to worry about time .
But there is good things about the tour guide .
That is the tour guide explain that sometimes people do not know .

Second , if we travel by a tour guide , we depend to other people .
Because we can not make a decision by ourself .
We always have to ask other people 's opinion .
For example , if we want to go to the restroom , we have to ask the tour guide .
And it will cause that everybody has to wait for them .
Because we can not walk by individual .
This was real happen to me .
When my family went to travel by a tour guide , I wanted to go to the restroom and I asked my parents to go to the bathroom , but they are not let me to go to the restroom .
Then , I had to hold .
So I thought travel by a tour guide is not very smart .
Especailly , people have a litte children .

Third , if we go other country to travel by a tour guide , we can not learn language .
For me , I am interesting to learn other language and while I try to speak other language and the tour guider helped me , it bather me .
I try best as I can .

There are good things about a tour guige , too .
The tour guide prepare everything we need such as hotel , meal , or plan during travel .
Also , the tour guider translate when they go to the foreing country .
This is good for people who do not want to speak other language .

In conclusion , the best way to travel is not in a group by a tour guide .
It is fun to travel by ourself .
It will be like adventure .
Traveling by ourself has a lots of advantages .
I think we should not depended other people , because we will not grow .
If we travel ourself , we will grow by step by step .
But we will not see it .
We should try travel by ourself .
Especally , who travel a lot by tour guide .

5196,904235.txt,P7,HIN,high,"I would strongly agree with this statement .
In today 's learning environment , a student needs to focus on qualitative learning as opposed to quantitative learning .
A need for comprehension of the concepts and ideas becomes increasingly important for a person to achieve success in his/her life .

As a child , Benjamin Franklin was relieved of studying at junior school since he would not learn up everything that he was required of him , which he believed it to be unnecessary as they were already provided .
He went on to later become one of the greatest inventors of all time .
Now I am do not believe that school is not important , but that these ` facts ' , which are merely clusters of information , are actually derived from ideas that other people once had .
Once a concept is understood , the idea can always be derived .
Once a theorem is known , a derivation can be made .

In contrast , if a student is made to only learn facts with lesser importance given to ideas , then that student may not be able to contribute to many aspects that require thinking in his life .
If everyone were taught to do something but not told why it is done or what principle underlies it , then innovation would become an extinct concept .
I would next like to highlight another important result - innovation .
It is the only thing that has given us what we have today ; this PC that I am operating on , the ETS testing system and countless other things .
Complacency would really bring us back to the stone age .

In conclusion , if we were to only learn facts and figures , then we would not require schools in the first place .
Everyone would be academically equal or based on the capacity of his/her memory , which would be a large encumberance to progress .
This is the reason that all universities stress on concept learning than ` mugging up ' .
To conclude , I would say that this statement is perfectly right and that it should prevail .

7060,1120348.txt,P6,HIN,medium,"I disagree with the statement ` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide ' .
I would like to putforth examples and situations I personally have experiences to support my opinion .

A person who travels alone I believe will have a lot more independency in making his own decisions rather travelling along with a tour guide .
With a tour guide we see our desicion being influenced by the guide and we get to see places the guide wants us to see rather than what we want to see .
It was in my school trip that my classmates and myself had a pretty bad exerience with the guide appointed to us .
The guide would take us to places we did n't want to see and he being a localite got us into a hotel that was quite expensive , because by doing so he would get a commission from the hotel authorities for getting them customers .
Other than that we had some other bad exeriences only because of the reason that the guide was a localite and was looking for grabbing commission wherever we went .

The best advantage in travelling alone would be that we could find out about a place by interacting with the localites or getting a copy of the local travel guide to guide us to the best places of visit .
In today 's advanced world we get to have the information of a place on our fingertips through the internet .
We also have amazing travel guide books that come in various languages and help us in getting a feel of the local culture .

I would like to end the topic on the point that I took this decision based on my personal experience and the other travel experiences that where great just because of the fact that we did n't take guide along .

In the following discussion , I would like to provide the evidence to support my view on this topic .

As the developing of the technology all over the world , Things are changing with each passing day , the inventions always appears in the market , and we could fairly said that the specialist in the program is doing the great construction .
They have deep mind in their own major , and would provide the worthless suggestions to the people , if without their suggestion , it might be hard for people to invent the novel things .
Although they do not have the wide knowledge of all the area , acturally the depth of the major they are specialized may not be touched by the generalist .
And because of the depth , they could find out the useful imformations generalist could not find .
To be honoest , if without them , just using the broad knowledge way , not all the inventions could come out so quickly .
Hence the specialist is really play an important role over the world .

the specialist contributed to the society , does not mean the generalist is less useful .
In the actual life , they just using their wide information to connect the major which they researched with the other areas , which is important to the research .
If a major just have their way and not communicate with the others , they would just like the frog in the hole , which could not get the farther developed .
And the generalist using their broad knowledge of many academic subjects to straighten the connect with the reference major , which would provide the researcher more spaces to think and to compensate the weakless , using this way , the technology is growing so fast and just this way can giving the sociey long development .

From the above we can easily see that the specialist and generalist are all suficient to the society , either of which could not be missed .
Just using the whole imformation that they both summerized , the inventions would stable in the society , and meet the need of customers .
If just having the specilist , the things is just adopted in the small area , which means it can not get the greatly developed .
And also , just using the generalist 's mind , the things are not deep stand in the society , which means the other products would easily over them in the short time .
So the specialist and the generalist can not seperated .
From the specilist , the generalist could get the details of the inventions , and from the generalist , the specialist would not just focus their eyesight in the tiny area , hence as the compensation they two get togher would take the novel developed to the technology .

10184,1656037.txt,P6,SPA,high,"Imagine walking through the Costa Rican tropical forest with one 's closest friends .
As you march through the various types of plants and life-forms , you encounter the rarest type of bird in all of Costa Rica : the `` Mancha Roja '' .
Its astounding colors amaze you and you 're friends to such a point that you become frozen on the spot .
Such a scene would not be frequently seen with the structured group tours guided by an expert .
It is obvious that when one drifts away from the traditional ideas and creates one 's own pathways , one will discover new and amazing things that would have otherwise been hidden .

If one does not separate from the typical behavior produced by human nature , society would still be living under medieval age conditions and no true discoveries would be made .
It is essential to think outside the box in order to get the best from an experience .
If one uses a tour guide to explore and discover the riches of our world , one will not be truly discovering the hidden treasures but instead be following a simple lesson .
If that is what one truly seeks , then maybe a textbook would be more cost-efficient than an expensive tour guide .
With this conservative attitude of following someone around , Thomas Alva Edison would not have discovered the lightbulb , or the Wright brothers would not have soared in the skies .
In order to see the unseen , it is key to make one 's own path and explore , try new things and base one 's opinion and thinking upon that , rather than on a tour guide that one does n't even know .
Going back to the initial example of the mysterious bird , if one had walked along the amazon with a group of people , that bird might have been scared away by unfamiliar noises .
One would have missed out on what could have been the most enlightening and fabulous experience of years of exploration .
Had one gone along the inexistent path , one might have seen this bird along with many other incredible animals , therefore the pre-written path does not lead to discovery and hence must not be followed .

Creating our own paths in life is absolutely vital to the enrichment of our minds .
Following a group , led by a tour guide , into the unknown cannot even be compared to the experience of entering the unknown without direction or expectations .
Without a doubt , the best way to travel is , and always will be , traveling through the rugged , virgin and unexplored paths .

12041,1986859.txt,P4,HIN,medium,"I completaly agree with the point that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are and to elplain my point here are some examples which we see in our daily life .

Advertisements are to promote the products and to make the consumer feel that this is something really big for example there is a advertisement for hidden vally ranch salad dressing and it goes like this , there is a girl sitting in her dining room and she takes a bite from her salad boul .
the moment she takes a bite the backgroung of her dining room change and she is presented as sitting in a garden under the tree and all is so nice and green and the weather had change after eating that salad and she is in new land and happy .
The point is can any one really get transfered from a busy and stressfull life of city to a nice and pleasent life of country side ranch by just eating a salad dressing this is not true and they really make product seem better than it really is .

Another example is of the the crest toothpaste in the advertisement it tell that it if u start useing the crest whiteing tooth paste ur teeths will be white as pearl in few days .
But theortically it has been proven that every human being have a different color of there teeth based on the mineralization that took place during the formation of teeth , there surroundings , there genetics some tribe have whiter teeth than the other , there eating habbits etc .
simply brushing the teeth will not make them pearl white .

Another example is of a nutrigrain bar .
In the advertisements it says that just haveing the bar will fill u with energy and u will feel really good and strong .
The actor in the advertisement starts jumping and make u feel like u will be all muscular and strong by just eating one bar .

Conclusion is most of the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are and i totally agree with the point .

3468,601537.txt,P6,TUR,medium,"Travelling by a tour guide or alone ?
Some people prefer the former while others prefer the latter .
To each his own .
However I am a person who likes to travel alone , therefore I am disagree with the statement for the reasons below .

First of all , in these kind of tours , the guides usually give general or most interesting information - according to them of course - and do not state details which I may like .
Therefore I like to have my own books about this certain places and travel with them and read detailed information which are interesting for ` me` .
For instance , while I was travelling around the western Europe , I had these books which gave me extremely sufficent information about the places I have seen .

Secondly , you can take your time when you are travelling alone , however you do not have opportunity to spend your time efficiently when you are travelling by a tour guide .
Therefore you usually do not have time to examine the places that you travel , moreover you do not feel them since there is pressure of the guide because they just want to finish the tour and get their money as soon as possible .
For example , in the same trip I mentioned before , I had an experience like that .
The guide finished 30 minute tour in 10 minute , using the hot weather excuse and then I never attemped to go a trip by a guide .

Last but not the least , by travelling on your own , you have the flexibility of choosing places which you do not have if you take a all included trip .
So you would not face to travel all over the places which you do not like or even hate .
Because it is waste of time and money .
Trerefore spending your energy for the places that you like is more sensible .

To sum up , people who like to gain general information and like to see most interestingly claimed places in a time like blinking your eyes , should prefer guide tours .
However I prefer travelling alone because of the flexibility of time and possibility of choosing place and the detailed information .

6538,1072397.txt,P6,KOR,medium,"The paasage reads that it is the best to travel with conducted group tour led by a guide rather than travel alone .
Obviouslly , traveling in guided tour can be amusing and safer than single tour especially for those who do not have travel much and do not want take any risks in travelling .
Nevertheless , I have different ideas to this .

First , I believe travel ifself is a teacher of our life .
As , during the travel , we get to see lots of differnt people and living enviornments we may have thinking back and forth of our lives in the place we are living and to the people we are interacting about future and the past .
Thus , it can help grow our thoughts to more delegate and mature to which often group guided tour cannot teach as we may spend much of our times with other people in the group and listen to guider all the way of travel .

Second , travelling alone can have more open chance of unique experience to which group guided tour may not have such as talking with native residents and experiencing unique cultures and foods to which most group tours miss as they tend to focus on what mass tourists like and hear in shallow .
For me , while I travelled Europe alone in the early 1990s , I got to experience all the newest unique things which nobody did tell me before .
It was absolutely unforgettable experiences I have until now .

Finally , as tour-guide led travel does not require lots of information and tolls we are travelling , even after travel , we become forgetting easily and do not know much about country we had been putting aside of more money it cost as group tour more focus on spendig the money .
On the contrary , travel alone does require lots of pre-information , studying , and planning ahead of travel .
However once we are back , the outcome we have thourought travel cannot be the same of group guided tour .

As above , for me travel should not be necessary accompanied by group of people nor amusement should follow .
Just being alone can match great journey as being good traveller .
So , I disagree to the sentenace of favoring guided group tour .

2920,505538.txt,P7,TUR,low,"It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
I agree with the following statement .
Students are young and generally do not enought experiences for their life .
They do not responsibility for their life and they are generally very busy on their life .
Thats why , there are many reasons for my support idea .

Firstly , they are young and they have not done enought experiences for their life .
I am a Faculty at the Dokuz Eylul University in Izmir , in Turkey for seven years .
I have studied a lot of students .
In my experinces , they understand and believe ideas and concepts because they are so young for life and they have not done anythings .

Secondly , almost all students are very busy .
They learn a lot of things .
They have studied on their life such as homework , listening , reading , speaking and writing .
However they have not had any experinces such as earning life , earning money , doing help anybody etc .
Actually I do n't know another countries but at least , in Turkey is this .
Our curriculum teach generally good math , geography , history , biology or anything but it does n't teach life knowledge , This is big mistake and Turkis educational system and its curriculum has to be change .

Finally , they don ' have enought responsiblity .
In my view , this is educational system 's problem .
For instance , in Turkey almost all students go to secondary school and high school .
They study and they do homework .
Neverthless , usullally they do n't do any home made .

In my opinium , if we succed for new generation , we have to learn life 's facts and we have to give more responsibilities .
We have to change our traditional educational systems .
They have learn life , world , and world 's problem such as war , peace , environment , conflict and etc .
Because , tomorrow life for them .

2106,362565.txt,P2,TEL,medium,"I strongly speak in favour of `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
Although older people who are successful in achieving their gaols and retired they always think to go back to their young age and still wants to enjoy their lives .
The following sentences and examples will further support my view .

The younger people have always in a motivation to achieve their joy .
They have the spiritual power and physical strength to reach their enjoyment .
As they have n't seen the world as much as old people do they always look for some new ideas and try to enjoy in what ever they did as its their new experience .
Even though young age is the time to decide about their future they always take it as a challenge and try to build their way to sucess .

A person always wants to hide their age and feeling of getting old to make themselves look younger .
I want to mention about an experience in my life .
I happen to meet a really good old couple who adopted me as their daughter .
I remeber asking them whether they like their old age or their younger life , they answered me like this `` we are not old by our heart , its only for our physical appearance '' and they always wants to go back to their younger life and wants to enjoy more than what they did .
They even encouraged me by saying that young age is the only time where you can enjoy up to the maximum and after that you will have lots of responsibilities to do .

On an all a person will get old in the near future but never can come back to their young age .
I always wants to go to my child hood days and play alot with innocent mind .
So every stage in our life has its own experience and enjoyment where we want to go back to experience it again .
All of these stages young age is the best age to enjoy your life so I will enjoy my teenage life now .

2926,507175.txt,P5,TUR,high,"Cars are the main contemporary transport devices that are widely used by people today .
However , although there are a vast number of cars in our world , I think that they will start to decrease in a few decades .
I believe that in twenty years , by the decrease in the amount of petroleum , and by technological improvements that will enable us to travel longer distances in cheaper costs , the number of cars will decrease dramatically .

Petroleum is the main natural resource that is used as the fuel for cars .
However , because of the huge consumption of this natural resource , it was greatly reduced .
After twenty years , the petroleum that is left will not fulfill the needs of overpopulated people in cities .
Because of that , petroleum prices will be much higher , and the people will have to think twice before purchasing a car .
For example , because the gas prices are more than people can afford in Turkey , people prefer travelling short distances by foot , and large distances by busses , which are considerably cheaper than using owned cars .
Because of that , the number of cars decreased considerably .
Therefore , because petroleum is a natural resource that is decreasing constantly , in twenty years , people will use other ways to travel , instead of cars .

Moreover , thanks to the technological improvements , new transportation devices , which are more convinient , are used .
Years after years , devices that enable quicker mass transportation have been made .
For example , the usage of the underground travel system , namely metro , has increased in all around England .
Because of the traffic caused by the high population of cars , metros superceded cars in England .
In twenty years , this new method of travelling will be widespread in the entire world , and , as a result , there will be fewer cars used for travelling .

Consequently , I believe that , in twenty years , by the increasing technological advances in transportation , cars will not be used anymore , as they are used today .
Because of unique inventions and the depletion of the natural resource of petroleum , healthier and more convinient devices will be invented for the benefit of human beings .

8150,1266585.txt,P3,DEU,high,"It is true that the question whether young people give enough time to helping their communities has always been of great interest .
Although many people argue that community involvement is not sufficient , especially within the younger generation , I personally believe that there is much more activity than many people know .

First of all it has to be taken into account that many young people , after finishing high school , spend a couple of month or even a year working for the community .
Indeed , no matter whether it is military or social service , this time is sacrified for their country or for projects abroad .

Second , unlike many people believe , statistics proove that community involvement has even increased during the last years .
For instance , already during high school many pupils spend their free time within clubs or associations .
These activities might be related to sports , within a religious community or even related to political work .
But the growing engagement of young people is especially obvious on colleges .
Indeed , all universities have different kinds of student associations and they are likely to have also one where students deal with social projects .
These may include fundraising for a third world country , helping children with their homework or organizing events for elder people .
There is a large variety of what students do , but they all proove a high committment for other people an the community .

But there is also another reason , that clearly indicates the growing importance of engagement which is not directly related to the acedemic or professional career .
Since a couple of years , it can be noticed , that companies are looking for people to hire who have a proven track record of social engagement .
Indeed , social skills are getting more and more important , and young people are also aware of this .
Therefore , they try to proove their community involvement and thus improve their career opportunities .

To conclude , given the examples described above , there can be no doubt about a significant involvement of young people helping their communities .
On the other hand , there is still potential for more and people in general should always try to spend some time in helping others .

4500,783076.txt,P5,ARA,medium,"I agree with this statment because in the future less people will obtain cars due to the advanced technology in the mechanical feild which might produce new inventions that might be easier to use , safer for the enviroment , has a lesser consumption of fossil fuel and doesnt cause traffic jams which is a major problem faced by our community today .

Cars now adays are a major head ache to the people who live in developed cities due to the traffic jam caused by them .
This started making some scientists to think of macking hay while the sun shines by building flying cars which could have special air tracks and traffic signals which will stop the traffic jam .
Ofcourse they are still working on the project trying to minimize as possible the cars price to offer opportunities to major people to buy this kind of cars .

Many goverments started thinking of building under grount trains that also will fasilitate the decrease in traffic jam and at the same time provide convinience to the people who use them as thy will make them reach to their wanted place in a lesser time due to their high speed and it makes them also save a lots of money as they dont have to pay for petrol or cars maintanence .
Not to mention that the trains tickets pice will be very low .

Other goverments like in china enhance the people living their to use bycicles to go all around the city by macking special tracks and signals only for bycicle users not to mention the secial parking rods that are placed in front of each building to make it much more esier for the people over there to park their bycicles safely and head on to their jobs .

So the phrase `` products that seem much better than they are '' is an hillusive assertion because we really do n't know what we are buying , eating and always thinking .
So I surely agree with the statement but I think is not usefull to complain about a situation if you do n't work to change it .

The real conditions of many products are hiding to the consumers : we can find many example , from medicines to energy drink ..

So probably the only thing to say is that we are all blind !

The matter is about imperfection of market and information : with a basic economical study everyone can understand that there 's no needing of marketing for the right process of production and distribution of things .

5635,988688.txt,P8,KOR,high,"People can be successful in many fields such as arts , sports , or study .
In my opinion , successful people have enthusiasm that leads them to try and achieve something that seems challenging while other are just being lazy .
As if there is a saying , '' no pain , no gain . ''
.

First of all , I would like to say that people who are successful are challenging taking risks .
In my country , there was a famous swimmer .
He was very famous , especially when he was young .

He used to take all of the medals from the competitions and was considered as the best swimmer in my country .
He was very eager to try the father distance to swim .
after he retired , despite his age ( 40 ) he tried to swim across the river in Korea .
The river was the biggest in Seoul , and the every scenes were being aired on TV .

Even though he looked very hard , people could see that he would success to swim across the river .
After the success , he tried another river and also to the island near the mainland .
Actually , after that , he failed by tireness and long distances , but he kept trying to achieve his goal with his challening spirits .

Secondly , successful people have common in their willngness .
What I mean by that is that people who are successful have strong wills .
There is a singer who is very famous in Korea and Asia .
When I saw him first , he was ugly .
Many people thought that he would probably not be popular and quit the job as a singer .
But his capability to dance and sing was so amazing that people were surprized .
after getting popularity , he had lots of interviews and he used to say that even if he is ugly , he promised himself that he would success as a singer by his talents .
Now he is a attractive and talented singer in Asia .
He never gave up and strived to become a singer despite the people around him who used to oppose him to become a singer .

In a conclusion , successful people have their strong will and challening spritis in common as explained above .
Even if people know how to do something well , if they just lose their enthusiasm , it wo n't certainly lead to a success .
People need to take the strong will before giving up .

456,81507.txt,P8,ZHO,medium,"As people know more and more in their lifetime , they suppose it is the most important to try things new , in order to bring them to a higher level that can make them a successful person .
However , this could hardly be true since success not only costs new ideas , but also hard working and patience of woking on things they have already known .

First of all , it is said that practice makes perfect .
Without repeating over and over again , doing the same thing , people cannot finish a task greatly .
For instance , the famous Chines athlete , Liu Xiang , as one of the best runner in the world nowadays , he is successful .
Yet he is trained to do the most simple and basic things everyday to win the golden metal .
He is requested to go slowly running and log distance running , and jump back and forward in the field .
These things are certainly the things he knew how to do when was five years old .
Although knowing how to do them , he keeps on practising everyday , and the repeating , however , takes him to the first place in the race and achieve his success by this kind of training .
So , doing what a person has already known and do it better and better , even the best , can enventually make a person successful .

In addition , poeple keeps doing the things they already know is much more important than merely trying new things .
This is just like a basic attitude towards life , which shows that a person can not do things he knows well , can barely do things he does not even know .
For example , if a person does not read very well , that means he/she cannot read fast and accurate , he/she will not achieve a nice score in university that requires a high level of reading skill .
In this case , the reading ability is the person has already known and , further , may has the approaches of how to read well , but the poor reading ability affacts him/her in the field of further education , and the real situation is , before he/she tells other people how to read , or tries the new ways of reading , he/she has already failed the universities .

Finally , a person concertrated on trying new things will overlook the purpose and importance of doing things in this new and risky way .
Noting knowing how to ride a bicycle , is the question remains untill a person fell down from the racing bicycle or a motorbike .
The things people have already know may seem boring , but the day people understand it really well , they can see through their aim of trying new things and will be mote possibly , successfull .

Hence , it is the most significant for a person to become successful to do things they have already known and do it as great as possible .

At least as far as our civilization will save unchanged its concept of progress and wellfare .

It is a matter of fact that the main source of energy for our society , ( that 's oil , petroleum ) , on which is based also the whole productive chain of our new millenium culture , wo n't last for ever .
Thus answering about the population of cars within twenty years becomes quite a complex subject .
Just consider that a similar crisis , the lack of the source energy ( slaves ) which was at the base of their productive system , deeply contributed to the fall of Roman Empire ...
and yet we do not have reports about wondering whether in their future the Romans would have used slaves for their leptigae or something else .

And then , would it be possible that an old device such as a car has become defintely obsolete in more than one hundred years ?
Because otherwise you see , I really cannot understand why a tool supposed to improve our speed and mobility nowdays just jam us more than else .

7404,1151272.txt,P6,SPA,high,"Alone , the Best Way to travel it

I disagree with the statament that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
I consider that it is better to travel alone .

I believe that when people travel in groups , they have to be accountable to the group .
This can be very stressful and could affect the way they enjoy their vacations or trip .
For instanse , if anything happen to any person of the group , the other people have to wait or spend time assisting this person .
In the contrary , I believe that when we travel alone we are able to develop our own schedule and to enjoy more freely without any interferance from any other person .
This will have a possitive impact in our vacation or trip that it was ultimately taken in order to relax and enjoy as much as possible .
Also , we will spend the time in the best manner without wasting time .

Moreover , when we travel in a group with a tour guide , we are not able to decide our trip 's plan , but we have to relay on the guide for any step to take during the trip .
In the oppositive , if we travel alone we know that we can make any decision regarding our trip 's plan or to decide the lenght of our stay or visit depending on our own circunstances , which defenitevely is more suitable and appropriate for me .
The goal is to enjoy the trip .

Also , travelling alone seems to be less expensive that travelling with a tour guide .
The fact that we have to hire a guide will increase the cost of the trip .

Furthermore , I believe that if travel alone , we will have more time to see the thing that really interest us .
For instance , in my own expenriece , when I visit a museum i like to spend enough time looking at the pictures rather than the other things .
If i have to follow a tour guide during a trip , it could happen that he or she will show the group the things that he or she considers important for her/his own , but it could be less important for me .
This could be dissapointed in the case that you cannot move forward to really enjoy or see what you really want to do .

Moreover , if you want to take any break during the trip , you will allow to do so if you are alone without asking anybody for permission .
We know if we travel with a tour guide in a group , you have to fully cooperate with everybody , and if you take a break will affect the group and their schedule .

In conclusion the best way to travel is alone , without a group or guide to follow as per all the above mentioned reasons .

2825,488721.txt,P7,TUR,high,"It is asked whether grasping the idea and concepts are more valuable than learning and just memorizing the facts .
I hold the view that , although sometimes it is useful to learn the facts , to be able to understand the idea and the underlying reasons behind a particular topic is far more crucial .
The students should be expected more than learning the facts and ways of critisizing these facts should be taught them .

To begin with , I believe that the facts do not always remain constant .
They can change with time and old facts can be replaced with completely new facts .
Thus , the facts itself are not always reliable .
To illusrate it with an example , before Galileo and some other scientists it was believed that the world was flat .
Besides , it was a well accepted fact .
However , later the facts were questioned and replaced with newer facts .
What I can recommend here is that learning the ways which go to these facts are more important and the ideas and concepts behind these facts form a more solid understanding for the students .

Secondly , the facts are usually more difficult to keep in mind .
Since I am also a student , I know very well that the facts are easily forgotten after one year or even after the courses finish .
Thus , to understand ideas would enable the students to carry their knowledge to their later periods of life .
Besides , focusing on the concepts and general ideas would also enable them to study more effectively , since they are usually more easy to remember .

Thirdly , the facts do not prepare the students for a real life at all .
Usually at school , the students just keep the facts in mind , which are explained by the teacher .
Later on , the students just memorize the facts in order to be ready for the exams and they usually do not grasp the topic as a whole or they cannot add something from themselves .
However ; when these students will graduate afterwards and will be in the real life , they will be expected to be able to interpret , to make comments and to offer new solutions based on basic ideas and concepts .
Therefore at school , the students should be trained and encouraged to question the facts and offer alternatives to these facts .
That is often a more effective way of education than learning the facts .

In conclusion , I support the idea that to understand the ideas and concepts is more crucial than just trying to keep the facts in mind .
There is no guarantee that the facts would remain as they are and a student should learn to do more than just memorizing the facts in order to be ready for a life outside of school when they graduate .
Thus , students are better encouraged to understand the ideas and concepts and be able to critisize the facts , which I think is more important than the facts .

For example you are a professor in a university and your departmant is biology but a chemistry proffesour can not be able to reach at school so that you can give a lesson about chemisty by using a relationship between this two subject .

Finally ; a person wants to improve himself or herself so it is very important to have a wide knowledge .
For instanse a student asks about an academic topic which is not your specific subject you can give an answer to the student because you knw many thing about many subject so that student may consider that you are a knowledge person .

When all the above things are taken into consideration ; having a broad knowledge or specializing in one subject are not too different from themselves .
But if a person wants to know so many things specializing in one subject is not suitable for him or her .
Best way is having a

1954,337831.txt,P1,KOR,medium,"In my opinion , being an specialist in specific subject is much more important than having a broad knowledge .
That 's because Modern society wants specialist .
At the previous time , such as 19 century , slight and broad information about all range of academic subject would make out efficient solution and perspective view of the problem .
But the world has changed .
We can get that kind of knowledge in internet , very easily .
It 's not wealth anymore .
So , having a normal knowledge about all over the academic subject can not makes you a needed person .

When you were teenager , school ( or teacher ) teaches you all kind of subject such as English , Mathmatics , Biology , Art , etc .
But when you get in to University , you have to choose your major and study deeply in that parts .
Why the education programme is changed general things to specific thing ?
University makes a leader not a just normal citizen .
When you roll as a leader , you need a specialized knowledge about your major .

The society goes to diversity , they need an specialist on several parts to solve complexe probleme .
So the importance of specialist is emphrased .
If you want to be a needed person , you have to study your own subject , and be specialist .
That way will make you wealth people .

2509,436408.txt,P3,DEU,high,"In my opinion , young people already do spend enough time helping their communities .

There are at least two kinds of communities they currently can be involved in , one is the parental community , consisting of the family members and the closer friends of the family , sometimes up to the whole village some people live in .
The other community is the one where the family usually is not involved in , this can be the colleagues from work , but also communities found on the internet or by creating or simply appraising works of art .

Some young people nowadays tend to spend more time in the latter , thus leaving the first community behind with a kind of ungrateful feeling .
This feeling is a remnant of former days , where people where forced to live together in order to survive and support themselves .

Nowadays these tasks that used to be distributed among all generations in a family can be transferred to public organs or private institutions .
This relieves other parts of the family off their burden , giving them more time to do and produce what they really like .

Even more , our modern societies practically force people to leave home .
People are required to be able to travel for work , or to move to different cities in order to obtain a proper education .

The possibility and the need to leave the community in which people grew up in of course weakens this link back home .

These young people pay back their former duties to their families or communities by different means .
Some of them are taxes , which in turn - at least in most of the European countries - are put back into community projects , or specific dwellings for retired people .
Another , equally important way , is to pay back their duties by creating works of art which can support the whole society .

I think by giving the people a choice of what to do with their time is having the biggest impact on the societies , and also communities .
The communities profit indirectly from this freedom .
I think the impact is a good one , the people who are criticizing this simply have to accomodate to the fact that the ways of feedback are changing .

9202,1468002.txt,P8,ZHO,high,"When people think of successful people , they think of a person who is willing to try new things and taking risks in life , a person who always jumps out of the comfort zone where he or she is so used to .
I completely agree with this statement .

In the business realm , new oppotunies are always there but lie in the hidden , unknown and risky areas .
Many people may see the oppotunity , but only successful ones are willing to take the risk to explore it .
Nowadays everyone is talking about the double-digit ecnomic growth of China and I believe no one on earth can not see the oppotunities there .
However , only a small handful of them could actually take the action to jump into this unkown territory and strike great success .

When students graduate from college , they usually think of finding a job related to their major .
Rarely do we see students are willing to explore new domains or unknown areas for more oppotunities .
However , it is usually from these small group of students who are willing to experiment new things where successful people emerge .
Take my personal experience as an example .
When I graduated with a computer engineering degree , I did not go routinely to search for an IT or engineering job , but instead , I jumped into a very new field called `` Bioinformatics '' by spending another two years in graduate schools for a master degree .
It was a daring move at that time because there was virtually zero `` Bioinformatics '' industry in the country I live in .
However , two years later , I embraced the prosperous of the field .

Our society needs all kinds of people .
Sometimes we can not judge a person 's success by measuring how much money he or she earns .
There are many great successful people out there doing notable work to our society , the poor people and the environment .
Many of them had their careers , and had lived their life comfortably .
But they did not choose to live on that way , but jumped out of the comfortable zone and did something more marvelous .

In conclusion , with all the above discussions and examples made in different domains , I totally agree with the statement that successful people are those who are willing to experimenting new things and taking risks .

5431,950654.txt,P4,HIN,high,"Advertisements , The Truth or False Exaggerations

Nowadays advertisements make products seem perfect and without any flaws .
But do these advertiements actually show the product 's true quality and worth ?

Recently I saw an andvertisement of a soap product that said that the soap would kill millions more bacteria and germs as compared to other soap products when used .
It stated that it contains certain chemicals , which had long and very `` flashy '' names .
Howewer this was not an exact detail , as even sunlight can destroy millions of germs and bacteria .
Later out of curiosity I checked the ingredients on the wrapper , And I saw that the ingredients were actually the same in almost every soap product of the similar type .
Another example is present within a soft drink company in India .
Several official reports stated that the product contained alarmingly high levels of pesticides , while the company continued to broadcast an advertisement which said that the drink had 0 % pesticides and was perfectly safe for human consumption .

Another advertisement was once brodcasted about a stock market fund .
It stated almost nothing about the risks involved in the investment , but only a very fine print at the bottom saying `` this investment is subject to market risks , please read the offer document carefully before investing '' .
The only thing it showed was celebrities saying that they would invest in the fund as they felt it right .

This is only a few of of many examples that a lot of people experience .
The truth is that the producers or the advertising Co. only want their product to be sold , irrespective of the truth about the product

Howewer this does no mean that all advertisements lie about their products .
Certain advertisements not only state the plus points about their products , but also the negative things , such as side effects , risks etc .

To conclude it can be said that , in the end it only depends on the consumer 's judgement to choose the product wisely and not fall for the exaggerations made by advertisements .

8328,1299460.txt,P7,ZHO,medium,"I disagree it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
Facts have more verious phononems and interested for students to understand .

It is more interesting to see the facts than just memorize the ideas and the concepts .
People are more likely to see the phononems than to read a book .
For example , in a chemistry class , if the teachers intend to show the reaction in front of the students. , what will they do ?
They prefer to do the experiment more than just talk about it and let the students to image .
It is the easiler way to show the process of the reaction , like the colors , sounds , smell .
Also , it has the variaty of the facts which can attract the students attention .
If a teacher do not use the facts in class , the students maight feel tedious and boring to listen .
At that time , they will move their attetion to another things .
Thay will cause bad effects to undetstand the knowledge .
In conclusion , it is interesting to use facts more than memorize .

It is also a good way to help the student to remember the mathod by prove it through the facts .
Sometimes people maight not understand what the teacher are talking about in class .
They need a better inprovement to improve them understand .
For example , the students may not understand what is the wave like .
Because of wave is not seen by people , it do not have the color , smelt and sound .
At this time , if the teacher use a fact which is like put the method into a experiment .
The teacher can show the wave by press the water and the student can see what is the water wave like .
That is why the facts have the better way to make the students understand .

In conslusion , using more facts are not only interested but more easier to help the students to understand than just read ideas and concepts .

11510,1890984.txt,P3,HIN,high,"Communities builds future of the nation by nurturing youth of today .
I believe no human being would disagree with the above statement .
Whatever we are or whatever becomes of a person depends largely on the community that he belongs too .
Today 's youth is aware of the above fact and people always tend to make the reason of your survival better .
Thus , I do not agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .

Young people of today are more responsible .
They understand the importance of community and thus consider its betterment their moral responsibility .
They are aware that communities are essential because man is a social animal and he needs support from his peers to survive .

They are more enthusiastic and work towards it .
The young people have much more caliber to plan and perform well as compared to elderly people in much less amount of time .
I work in a corporation where the maximum population is in their twenties .
We have so many groups that are functioning to helping the community .
These used to be an individual effort which turned into an organisation after recieving overwhelming response from the youngsters .
Now they consist not only people from our corporation but also from whole of the state .
The one i am with , works for the special care of mentally or physically challenged children named as DISHA .
Yes it consist of middle age people too but we are never short of young volunteers who like to help .

The NGO 's or non profit organisations are not the only way they are helping community .
Politics is a field where no youngster wants to end up ; specifically in a country like India .
But we have young MP 's ( member of parliament ) like Milind Deora and Sachin Pilot who at an tender age of 23-24 are helping people and trying to give a better future to our communites .

Young people are now diverted towards teaching too may it be part time .
Imparting education to the generations of tommorow is indeed a spendid way of helping the society .
Young people do whatever work they have to their full capacity which results in betterment of society .
Even investing in share market helps in betterment of the society because the money flows in the market resulting in more funds for government maybe for schools or even hospitals .

Yes i do agree today 's generation is more busy with their own life .
They do not find time for their families sometimes but i would rather say exceptions are always there .
But that does not mean that the young people are indifferent towards the community .
People in our organisation work on saturdays and sundays , sometimes during some function we even work late nights because we believe children who are yet to come need a better community as we got in our childhood .

Summing up i would state today 's youth is aware of its responsibilities towards the community .
They understand the importance of community and thus consider its betterment their moral responsibility .
Even if they do not have enough time some people would plan out and work actively in organizations for the betterment of the people .
And we would soon realize that today 's youth faces more responsibility than just being a fast forward generation .

I think people can enjoy life no matter how old they are .
I also think a person can feel miserable no matter they were young or old .
The reason people enjoy life has nothing to do with there age but is caused by other external factors and circumstances .

One factor that helps most people to enjoy life is being around the people they love .
This means that an old lady could enjoy life by being around her grandchildren .
It also means , that a young boy can feel miserable and unhappy when he is living away from his parents and friends .

Another factor which causes people to enjoy life is health .
People in good health usually enjoy life more than other sick people .
This means , that an eighty years old man who is in an excellent health condition is most probably enjoying life more than a sick eight year old boy .

Never the less , I believe that financial security help people to enjoy life .
Richer people usually has more means to enjoy life than poorer people .
This might sound shallow , but no one can deny that it is true .
This means that a very old billionaire can enjoy his life as he can use his money to do fun activities like travel .
At the same time , a young poor man may not be enjoying his life as he does'nt have the means to have any luxury .

In the end , I would like to stress how I do n't think age affects how much people enjoy life .
I think you can enjoy life wheather you were young or old ; however I believe there are other things which help some people enjoy life such as good health , money and being around the people you love .

10409,1697152.txt,P2,TEL,medium,"In my opinion , older people enjoy life more than young people do , although both of them have their own unique ways of enjoyment .
Young people mostly spend their time away from home enjoying outside , whereas older people enjoy most of their time spendind at home itself .
One reason may be that they are not strong enough to move around at that age or may be they have enough spent their time outside during their young age .
Younger generations are involved with studying and career development , where most of their teenage is runs off .
In contrast , older people must have either retired by then and so they can enjoy without any thinking for the future .

Moreover , responsibilities arrest the younger generations from enjoying their own life .
This does not happen with older people as all their responsibilities might have been finished by then .
For example , a younger person working has support his family finacially and should be responsible towards everyone in the family .
so , most of his time has been spent in accomplishing his goals and supporting the family .
Older people enjoy more because of lack of obligations at their age .

Although , younger people pass their time with friends , they do only occasionally .
First few years of teenage is spent in studying , after graduating jod search starts .
Later , work tensions builts up stressing in all aspects .
So , there is hardly anytime left over for joy in life .
In contrast , as the older people have already passed through these stages of life , they are absolutely free of such work pressures and hence enjoy their life to the maximum extent .

Another factor is money .
Older people are financially more strong than young people and so spend as much as they can because , they dont need to give explanation for the money they spent as do the young people .

To conclude , older people enjoy more than the young people .

Whenever this question stands in front of me , I ca n't even say a ward to answer it , but instead just stand there deligently and deeply considering what I really want to learn for endless time .
In some of the universities , they do n't ask to choose major but they give an oppotunity for students to take any subjects they want to .
However I do n't want belong to it .
I personally think that the knowing and specializing in one specific subject is much important because there are a lot of disadvantages of trying to have broad knowldege of many academic subjects .

Firstly , it is impossible to put all knowledge in the world in people 's small brain in such a short amount of life that we have given .
Human 's history is surprisingly long , and every new facts and information were found by people at that time .
Besides information and knowledge are always changing and increasing as time passes by .
As a result , the sum of those knowledge , which were found and will be found , are a lot and anybody ca n't input them in the brain less than a decade we got .

Furthermore , there are a lot of people who ca n't get job that they expect and become a unemployment .
One of the reason of this is because they have spread their views too wide and have n't focused on what they can really good at .
Even though they have broad knowledge , but it 'll be useless when it comes to reality since when people are getting job , they have to specialize what the specific job they work for .

To conclude , I believe that specializign in one specific subject is considerabely essential for people 's life since knowing as much as they can on many academic subjects is impossible .
Nobody is good at every subjects , however it is true that everybody has certain subject that they can do better than others do .

Firstly , the cause of global warming is the important point which i would like to support my view .
Elucidating about that .
We can observe the temperatures around us during the summer season .
The seasons are modifying gradually .
We ca n't expect the rain in the rainy season .
It is due to the alteration in the atmosphere cycle .
It 's happening all around India .
The main reasons are the atmosphere is getting warmed due to the green house gases that are emanating from various sources like the motor vehicles , cars , factories etc. , concentrating mainly on the cars .
They are releasing the harmful gases like carbon monoxide , carbondioxide etc. , which are detrimental to the human beings .
May be the government introduces a law that usage of cars may be prohibited and the usage of public transportation may be considered .

Secondly , the earth is running out of the renewable resources .
Even though that is not predicted , i hope that is so imminent due to the usage of the natural resources like petroleum , diesel .
Today the prices of the petrol and the diesel got hiked and they will definitely go more higher in the coming years .
From economic point of view the people may prefer other means like public transportation for reaching their destinations .
Let the petrol and the diesel supply be ceased for a month everywhere in the world for cars .
Then see how much the number of people using the cars would defintely decline .
They will definitely opt for the public transportation .
Later see the pollution of the environment .
I bet that u can definely notice a steep decline in the pollution level .
Even if any other source for driving the cars other than petrol or diesel is invented .
That too does n't last long .

Lastly , the science and the technology is developing at a rocket pace .
Nowadays you can buy everthing from your house by a single click of your computer mouse .
I hope that the entire world will be digitalized by the next twenty years .
If that happens , then definitely people dont need any cars for transportation .

It is unevitable concequence if he goes to a university .
Some people believe that having a variety of knowledge about a range of academic subject is better than to master only one acadmic subject .
However , without any doubt , it is better for person to specialize only one subject in his academic life , for his rest of life wheter he plans an academic career or not .

First of all , if a man proceed to focus on only one subject in his academic life , he may become a proffessional or master about that topic .
As a result , he may be a remarkable person who is recognized by a range of people .
Moreover , people begin to show theirs respect his thoughts , academic works or papers rather than others who are not special on the related topic .

As an another point of view , a person who works only one subject may likely to help to develop a device for humankind .
As an illustration , new technological advancements are emerging in everyday life such as those companies that produce computer chipset .
They develop and design smaller and smaller computer chips while their effiency inceares .

the reason behind it is they hire the person who has a mastership on related research areas such as computers or electronic science .

10965,1795364.txt,P5,DEU,medium,"With the rashly development of the automobile industries in the 1950's the use of cars increased exorbitantly .
By the following years to date most of every household possess at least one car or sometimes more than that .
After this explosive growth of applying a car the awareness of polluting and damaging the environment is also increasing .
This has been happening in the 1960's when the hippie movement was on their peak .

This means that up from then the people begin to think about the consequences of using a car and particulary using a car for movement for which a car is n't necessary .
They also started to consider what kind of aftermath their behavior will have for their children and the children of their children .
They recognize the impact of the using a car for the environment , for example they receive that the high use of pollutant like cars can be harmful for the ozon lawyer .

The turnover of conduct and so the try to treat the environment more carefully can be also found in many politcial strategies or in new laws for protecting the environment .
But in my opinion this changed thinking can be only found in industrialized countries like in the United states or in Germany .
Most of the far east continents like Asia are the contrary .
At this time they are getting through their industralizing process .
There the car use will be increse for the next twenty years .

Independing on this situation in asia I finally agree with the statement that in twenty years less cars will be used for the reason that some parts of the world have noticed the influences of using cars for the environment and necessitiy for acting now against the alreadz done damages .
Due to this awareness the decrease of using cars will recorded in twenty years .

1322,220420.txt,P5,DEU,high,"In twenty years the number of cars in use will not have diminished by a large number , I believe that rather the opposite will be true .
The number of cars will increase during the next twenty years .
Due to population rise and the development of different fuels the number of people able and willing to afford their own car will increase and so will the number of cars in use .

In countries like China or India , that have a large rural population without the means to buy a car today , the continuing growth of the population and the fast economic development will lead to more people being able to afford a car in the near future .
The prices of cars will go down in comparison to the income and this will lead to more cars being in use .

Another reason for my belief that there will be more cars in use twenty years from now is that new fuels are currently under research and will be on the market in less than twenty years .
For example the hydrogen powered car is already in use today , though it is not ditributed at large .
This development of alternative fuels will restrict the impact of the decrease of the resources like oil and gas has on the automobile industry .
That way nobody owning a car today will have to get rig of it because of fuel shortage .
These people can just as easily buy a car powered by alternative fuel , when their current car breaks down .

The alternative fuels , that are being developed today , are also cleaner and less poisonous to the environment .
This means that maybe people not willing to use a car today because of environmental reasons will change their mind and buy a car when the use of a car is no longer a hazard to the environment .

These reasons support my belief that the number of cars in use in twenty years will not be lower , but higher , than the number of cars in use today .
Population rise , the development of alternative fuels and the rapid economic development in countries with large populations will contribute to an increase in the number of people able and willing to afford their own car and thus to an increase in the number of cars in use .

He is energetic and active .
He always tries to do his best in his field .

For instance , my young sister has a goal of getting straight `` A '' s in her class .
She told me that she enjoys her life because she has a goal to achieve .
On the other hand , my mom told me that she ca n't enjoy her life as much as when she was young .
The main reason is that young people are more likely to have more goals than the older ones and the `` goal '' plays main part enjoying life .

To conclude , young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Firstly , young people are more active .
Secondly , they do n't worry about aging .
Lastly , young people are more likely to have more goals .
Once the time passes , it never returns .

525,95508.txt,P4,FRA,high,"I agree with the statement saying that most advertisements make products seem much better than they actually are .
Indeed , advertisements are made in order to sell a product , they are not based on objectivity .
In my opinion , advertisements are not a fair representations of the products they are proning .
Most of the time they emphasyse the good side of the product but they avoid mentionning the eventual problems that can be found when they are used .
For instance , an advertsiement for a piece of clothing will insist on the aesthetical aspect or on the fact that it follows the current fashion , but it wo n't insist on the fact that the fabric may be of bad quality .

Furthermore , advertisements make product seem better because , when it comes to clothing , the garment is advantaged by the fact that it is wore by a person who fits the aesthetic criteria of the population .
When a potential byer sees a piece of clothing , it is always presented to him in a way that it appears to perfectly shape the body whereas , in reality , the advertisors have certainly choosen the person who will make the garment look perfect .
It probably wo n't be the case when an average person wera it .

Last , the people who designed the advertisement often do surveys prior the release of the product .
The surveys are used to ask to a certain number of people , representative of the class aimed by the product , what they think about the product , what they like or dislike about the its shape .
This way of funcionning unables the designers to know what are the attracting sides of the product , it is easy then to highlight those aspects in the advertisement in order to attract the buyer .

That is why I think that people should not trust the advertisements they run accross .
Most of the time it has been designed to appeal to the customer and , when used , will prove to be much different than what one could have expected by seeing the advertisement .

I think that specialize in one specific subjcet is better .
Specialising you can give to your reserch a peculiar prospective and than increase your field of study .
Let give us some example based on my experience as anthropologist .
I think they could clearly illusterate what I mean .
During my anthropological field work in Cameoon , West Africa , I argued that there were lots of intresting aspects of this african society ( for example kinship , economical or religious sistems etc . ) .
However I Decided to foucus my reserch on witchcraft and sorcery .
Observing life in a small village I saw that I colud note phenomena of witchcraf in all social fabric .
The occult power was used a socilal and economical levellhood .

Moreover when I wrote my BA 's thesis I used a specifical prospective and a peculiar method of analysis .
I used the post-modern prospective on hidden cults of japanese chirstians and i demostrated how these hidden cults influenced the modern japanese chistians and others religious movements .

I tried to anlize just one aspect of the African or Japanese society and I tried to explain how these particular aspects reflected on whole society in different levels .
I think that have a broad knowledge of may academic subjects is not good or usefull .
A man could not be omniscent - as god - so is uneuseful try to accumulate many many notions about different arguments and topics .
Thus men , students , professors and so on need to recognize their limits and to work - as better as possible - on within their field of study .

This are the reasons why I think that specialize in one specific subject is the only way that men could adopt to costruct a brand new paradigm about knowledge .

Thus , I totally agree with the following statement .
All people would have experienced the power of the advertisement a lot of times .
I have a few examples to support my idea .

When I go to the mall , I see the new products each time .
One of them is cell phone .
I watch the TV almost everyday , mostly advertisement , I see the new cell phones everytime .
So many abilities of cell phone lured me to buy it , such as camera , mp3 , recorder , mirror , and walky talky .
Although I thought I will going to use it for sure , I did not use those abilities not much as I thought I would .
Because those abilities were less than I expected .
I will buy digital camera rather than camera phone , mp3 player rather than mp3 phone .
I was lured by watching advertisement .
I did not see the inside of cell phone but only believed in my vision .

Everytime I go to watch movie , I always decided to see the movie that has interesting poster , or has interesting short scene from the advertisement .
There are so many times that I regreted .
I realized that advertisements are important as much as qualities of the products .
I would not think that movies can not success without the advertisements .

The purpose of the advertisement is lure customers .
There are people make interesting advertisement , and that 's what they are for ; make it look better and nicer .
The market of the advertisements is growing , sometime company spend a lot of money to make best advertisement rather than make better quality .
However , we need to be warned before we purchase the products as well as understading the products .

3892,674795.txt,P7,ITA,medium,"I think that understanding a concept about a subject gives you a better knowledge of it instead of learning the fact related to it .
A theory gives you the mental preparation to face all kinds of facts , studing only facts does n't get to anything because facts can change during time .
If you see and study a fact , you can get the highest level of preparation on that specific issue , but probably it does n't give you that standard procedure you need to deal with it .

I am an university student , my degree course in economic is primarly based on theory , while another university in my city bases its courses on practice ; people of that university always say that they 'll get the best preparation on their subjects because they are studing them from the real world ; as an example they watch the every day stocks variations and use models to describe them .
I wo n't say that this is unusefull , but I think that instead of it , it would be better to study as many models exist in order to get a complete preparation of all kind of stocks markets .

Learning a theory enables the student to understand thousands more , and , more important , could give the student the possibility to think with his own head and enterpret all kinds of events with a single way of thinking , which can adapt quickly to any situation .

Moreover , if you think about how any kind of exam it 's made , you 'll find out that what is asked is usually not what was said by the professor in the classroom , but is something related to it , something new that you must elaborate with your acquired skills , otherwise is just a memory test !

To conclued I think that as we are not like computers recording data , we should use our brain to understand facts in order to know how to deal with other different situations that we will face .
Experience can help , but is not enough .

9995,1622079.txt,P2,HIN,medium,"You are active enough when you are young and this enables young ones to go for making enjoyment .
The word ` enjoy ' can be defined as the way by which people feel themselve happy and which gives a feeling of satisfaction .
In my opinion there isnt any distinction for enjoyment because everybody is unique in there enjoyment .
I am giving following reasons for holding this opinion .

Some young one takes enjoyment in doing crazy things .
They feel that doing something crazy will give them enjoyment while other may look it as risky thing which will not give any kind of enjoyment .
There is feeling of adrenaline rush which is enforced within the crazy performers , when they do some crazy things like making a jump from high altitude place , or making something different from the world .

In case of elderly persons , their ways of enjoyment are diffrent they like to read novels , magzines or some religious literature .
They will not perform any other physical activity .
This does n't mean that they are enjoying less .
Their ways and views towards this phenomenon is different that the young ones .
Some may like to talk they may feel enjoyment in talking about memories of there time or talking about one of the friend of them .
There are many number of ways to feell enjoyment and to make enjoyment .

Moreover today the most prominent problem of world is depression which people gets from their job work or any other stressfull comdition .
So everybody tries to get relaxed from that and want to get some kind of feeling of rest .
So they tries to grab every opportunity which they get for making an enjoyment .
Therefore you can observe many people doing some crazy things while othere simply watching them and stilla making enjoyment in their life .

To conclude , there should not be any distinction between young and olderone about who enjoys more and who dont .
Everybody is having their ways of enjoyment for them .

8905,1411008.txt,P3,TEL,medium,"I agree with the statement that `` young people do not give enough time to helping their communities '' .
Because in this modern world there are many things to concern with to them and the young people donot find time to helping their communities .

The young people are most enthusiastic when they are doing some thing .
Easpecially when they are spending their time for a variety of aspects , they may include studying , playing , watching the new vesions of films , listening music and to be say honestly they much inclined to enjoy themselves .
Most of the young people are students .
They do not find much time to think about community , their life goes through their studies .
Most of the young people are ignoring the community due to their competion among themselves .
At this era of their life they put more concentration for developing their future .
They donot spend their time for thinking about community , also it is not possible for them to help the community at that time .
Because every student is ruled by his or her parants .
One may think that he or she can serve the people when they stand successfully in the socity .
This may be the best time for any young person to think and serve there community .
There are many young people who are mainly facing the problem of poverty , thay even cannot efford for their education , in such a way they are in capable of helping society .

According to my opinion finally I can conclude that the age of the young people is the mainly and only cause that put them to ignore their community .

2361,408839.txt,P3,DEU,high,"`` Why do n't you get more involved in church community activities ? ''
, my father used to ask me when I was younger .
In my oppinion there are a lot of factors that have to be taken in account , when analyzing the modern situation .
But the trend certainly shows , that young people spend less time for helping their community .

Modern improvements forced us to focus more on individuality than years before .
For instance , many television advertisments show successful stars , who want to show the importance of individual potential .
If you are a great actor or singer , why focusing on the community ?
This will sooner or later evolve to an attitude of egoistic .
Which means , I am the most important person in my life and this is what really matters .

Second , young people are less bound to their evironment and requirements for a successful life changed .
Today , you need to be able to adjust in a short time , for instance , to a new city or country .
Otherwise , employers might choose someone else for the job .
Furthermore , expactations of adults towards children changed , too .
School and marks are more important than anything .
As a matter of fact , students in Japan spend most of the time in school or at home , while preparing classes and learning from textbooks .
There is hardly any time left for the community .

Yet , the most striking factor is human lazyness .
For example , when you live in a big city , you do n't rely on your neighbours .
However , many people living in huge , crowded areas do not even know the people living next to them .
There is no reason for communication and as long there is a possibility , that people take advantage of your friendship without giving something in return , human nature tends to refuse interaction .
Supermarkets , cold stores and several other services enabled people to live independent from any community .
There is obviously no need for a community .

In conclusion , I agree with the statement .
Roughly speaking , young people avoid responsibility towards communities in recent decades .
Certainly , they should think about changing their minds in the future and realize the benefits .

2788,483654.txt,P4,FRA,medium,"I remember an TV-ad about some kind of perfume which , once applied on your body , could bring you all the beautiful girls or boys that you may have dreamed of .
I bought it and I can assure you that it does not work !
Maybe I was abused by the advertising but for sure , but in my view the advertisement tends to overstate the main features of a product , and I will give the main reasons for that .

First , the main goal of an advertisement - and it is also the aim of marketing - is to promote a good or a service in order to increase its sales .
As a consequence , the presentation of the product could not be fair in a sense .
Indeed , I am quite certain that if a TV-ad shows the weakness of a good or service , in order to be partial , this good or service would be as appealing as the same presented by an ad which shows only the good aspects of it .

Second , advertisement tends to reach the imaginary part of our person to increase the attractiveness of products .
By doing so , consumers are dreaming about such products and idolize them .
For instance , you may have the strong desire to buy a luxury car because you have seen it on the TV and it was shown in an ideal place .
Or you want to book your holidays in a pleasant place because you find the photographs you have seen very beautiful .
But in fact the real situation could be , at least , normal .

As a conclusion , I do think that the advertisement does not provide a fair image of the products it supports .
But it is worthwhile to mention that it depends on our own mind to distinguish between what it is true or not .

3000,521806.txt,P5,ZHO,high,"This is a controvertial topic about whether the number of cars will reduce in twenty years .
As far as I am concerned , there will be fewer cars .
My reasons are listed as follows .

First , we should take a glance at the opposite opinions .
Some people will deem that with the rapid economic growth ( especially in China ) , people will continue to buy their own cars because it is a convenience to their lives , they do not need to wait a long time and get into a crowded bus , which is commonly seen in China .

However , these people seem to ignore several essential aspects that would lead to the reduce of the numbers of cars .
The important reason is that people 's awareness of protecting the environment is gradually increased .
We all recognize the fact thatour environment is facing serious problems caused by human pollution , like global warming and water pollution , air pollutions .
And the government as well as the increasing number of people are taking effort to protect the environment .
They can give up using of plastic bags , so they can also give up buying their own car .

The equally important reason is that the oil price skyrockted in the last year and the prices are going to increase in the future .
It is just too expensive to afford a car to the majority of people because they have to use a lot of money to support their family , to pay for the education fees of their children , and to pay for the medical services .
They will choose to use public transportations due to the higher and higher oil price .

Moreover , the government is taking great effort to build public transportations .
They use a large number of money on developing more rail road , more buses to every corner of the contry .
and also metros have been built to easing the heavy traffic in more and more big cities .

Taking into account of all the aspects mentioned above , I am firmly convinced with the opinion that the number of cars will reduce in twenty years .

4454,774257.txt,P8,ZHO,medium,"Have you ever tried new things and take risks ?
Have you ever had a false sense of feelings when you do this ?
Or , you just want to concentrate on things that you know ?
If I were you , I would prefer to try something new and encounter any kinds of risks .
These kinds of behaviour are indispensible , and they are the role to suceed .

Trying new things would probably expand your horizons .
You would have an opportunity to explore the universe - discover different cultures , polish your laguange abilities , improve your communication techniques or leadership qualities - all are invaluable experiences .
Only if you had the faith to try new things , you would enjoy the fruit .
Take Nadal as an example .
He is undoubtedly one of the best tennis players nowadays .
Have you ever heard of his story ?
He played soccer instead of playing tennis when he was in his fancy age .
In spite of the fact that he had never played tennis before , his bravery encouraged him to taste tennis .
Shortly after that , his envious talent in tennis was discovered .
His success nowadays , was originated from his bravery to try new things .
Why do n't we try new things ?

Apart from doing something new , learning to take risks is also critical to a success .
Risk management plays a major role in any kinds of business , sports , politics .
Once you have made a decision , risks are inevitable .
Imagine that you were a participants of a gambling campaign , once you have gambled your money , risks occur .
You may loss your money .
But once you learned the skills to take and manage risk , you would take the loss as a piece of salt .
Taking risk may develope your strength as well .

All in all , trying out new things and taking risks are the major factors to succeed .
Albeit that doing what we already know may be saft and secure , others qualities are also important .
"
4532,787404.txt,P3,HIN,high,"I do agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not devote enough time to helping their communities .
To be more clear , by young people i would mean people in the age group of 20-35 yrs .

As times are changing , people are getting more and more involved with themselves , and the materialistic pleasures of life .
This is especially true of the young generation , who value money more than anything .
As a result , most of the attention of our youth is on earning money , and hence they are busy fulfilling their aim .
Today 's world is very competitive and in this struggle , young people often do not find the time to contribute to their community .

Another reason for such a thing , is that communities are no longer close knit as they used to be .
There is a lesser feeling of belonging to some particular community , and there is the emergence of a global community .
More and more people travel to various places , and hence it is difficult for them to associate with a particular community .

Reasons apart lets state some examples from our experiences .
One such example is the lack of participation of youth in voluntary organisations , such as those for educating the poor people .
It might be true that young people contribute money in such schemes , but we dont see too many young people , actually going out there and teaching .
Another example is the absence of young leaders in our government .
Young people do not find such a career very financially rewarding and hence abstain from actively participating in the functioning of a government .

So as time is progressing , young people are getting motivated to work more for themselves , than for their communities .
I would not say that this is true for all young people , but it would hold true in most cases .
Such a drift away from community responsibility is primarily motivated by the current lifestyle of the younger generation .
"
4740,827072.txt,P3,DEU,medium,"I agree partly .
The whole situation changes from time to time and through the globalization there have been a lot of important changes in society .
Young people definetly have more possibilities to spend their free times for things they really like and therefore one could easily say that there is a big change in the behaviour of young people .
Furthermore life becomes faster and that is why everybody , not only young people have to think better how and why they do the things they do and if it is the best they can do .

Besides that it differs from age , religion and place in society how active or passive young people are in their communities .
My own experiences are that I myself help a lot in my community and lots of my friends do so too .
An other point one have to have in mind is how the young people feel in the community .
If they are happy with the world around them the help of the young people is logical , but if they have no friends and fun at work it is logical that they are not willed to help the community and prefer to sit in their room next to the computer or television .

Besides that the government could try to make help and work of young people more public , so that the young people can see , that they can help and perhaps can have a better feeling throughout that , what they have done .
For me it would be important to show which goals young people can reach .

Finally it seems as if young people are lazy and do not give enough time to help their community , but in my opinion nothing changed and nothing will change .
There will be young people who help and there will be young people who does not do so .

1542,258207.txt,P7,TUR,medium,"I agree this idea .
It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
The students should find a new ideas or new concepts for the our future .
If they learn only facts it is bad because they will be afraid from the facts than they can not to find new ideas or they can not learn the concepts .
For example when my father start to fruit business he tell me about the business and some information about the money i said this is very big business and we can earn lot of money but when he started to tell me the facts i afraid of that business and i promise myself if started to work i will not do fruit and banana business .
Now i am 18 years old and i dont do that job and i can not find ideas and i didnt learn any concepts about this job i am very upset now and than i promised myself again and i will never learn the facts before i started the new job .
I want to mantion about that now my father the best in the banana business because he always learn new ideas and new concepts .
The students should learn and understand ideas and concepts .
When we started to new projects or new jobs we have find and learn new ideas and consepts than i think we will see the facts .
The life is hard and every time you have to learn something and you have to learn ideas and concepts .
"
2776,482407.txt,P7,HIN,high,"I do not subscribe to the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts .
Students should be more focussed on getting the facts right as facts hold them are unalterable and are bound to hold them good in long stead .
What may seem a great idea to one person may be perceived as unfeasible and dismissed by another idea from person who has taken a different approach .

Ideas can be whimsical and outlandish .
They can even range from bizzare to plain absurd .
It is here that facts stop whimsical ideas to take flight and cause unnecessary wastage of time and effort by a team of creators .

Let me quote a recent example .
Donald Trump , the real estate mogul from New York , mooted the idea of the new season of hit TV series , The Apprentice on racial lines .
The contest was previously held between university graduates and non degree holders .
For the latest season he came up with the idea of the contest taking place between colored and white people .
The idea , before it could shape up further , drew huge criticism and widespread uproar among the society as to how come racism form the basis of a tv show that is essentially a recruitment process which is broadcast all over the country and abroad forcing Trump to abandon the idea and issue an apology .

This idea would never have been come up , if Donald Trump had acquainted himself with the fact , that anything remotely racist would be condemned widespread as racism in any form is still a sensitive issue .

This is not to say that ideas and concepts should be trashed away completely .
They should be allowed to prosper only after the facts have been taken into account .
Facts form the basis of ideas and concepts and unless a student has got his facts in place , he will not be able to come up with original and progressive ideas .
A building cannot be stable when the very foundation of it is weak and infirm .

4075,708119.txt,P2,HIN,high,"Accoding to my opinion young people do enjoy life more than old people do .
The first reason that supports my opinion is the age factor .
Young people are free from troubles or fears that come with old age .
Talking about the fear , i mean the fear of death and the fear of physical ailments that come with old age .
Although old people are free from the basic responsibilities of life but still they cant enjoy their freedom from responsibilites the way they want or deserve because of thier old age and the problems that come with it .
Young people live with energy and a youthful and positive attitude towards life .
Even though they have responsibilities and goals to achieve , but still they are always filled with energy and an attitude to achieve what they want from life .
This is because they are free from all the barriers that come hand in hand with old age .
These barriers discourage old people from enjoying life to the fullest .
They are nomore in a mental and physical situation to accept challenges in life .
They are not capable of setting goals in life and this inturn keeps them away from the ecstacy and joy of achieving a goal that younger people have the ability to enjoy .

Another point of view would be the advancement in technology and the generation gap .
The older genration is still suffocating in the claws of orthodox and conservative ideas which also stops them from enjoying life to full extent .
They are also unaware of the technological improvements that have taken place and are also not ready to identify with them .
They still want to stand by their old orthodox traditions and dont open themselves to the fresh breeze of todays world .
They want to keep a closed mind and dont want to breathe in the fresh air of the modern world .
All these factors act as big barriers in the way of their enjoyment .

On the other hand , some people enjoy the afraid feeling and the risks .
Many times , the some people , who try something not familiar , could be successful , fortunately .
In my opinion , trying new things is effective and essential to make one 's life and others ' lives successful .

The first reason why I think trying something new is right is that it needs to be brave .
Even though there are a lot of damages and risks as you try a new thing , the difficulties probably can give chances to your life .
Bravery is one of the most important factors in order to not only be success but also live confidence .
In that , trying something new means the person is very brave , which need to be self-esteem oneself .
I believe someone , who loves oneself , can enjoy his or her life .

In addition , trying something new gives more oppurtunities .
If you do what you already know how to do well , you would probably do not fail .
However , you cannot success as much as you want , because the ordinary thing is for everyone .
The new things are only way to get more oppurtunities .
For example , Bill Gates is the richest person in the world .
However , at first , his company was not that much wealthy to make him the wealthiest person in the Earth , because `` computer business '' was not famous , then .
Fortunately , Gates chanllenges into the new field , and he attains his goals and helps other humans to enjoy computers .

Finally , trying new things makes the world improved .
When people who try new things success , it means the world becomes more comfortable .
Such as many inventors , scientists , or artists are the person who do express their idea in a new thing .
Because of their bravery , many human beings ' lives become more convenience and interesting .

Successful people who try new things should be honoured by other people .
I also want to be a successful people in order to improve not only me and but also other people .
Even though the first time to try new things is hard , I will not be afraid of doing that .
For thes reasons , I think trying new things is effective and essential to make one 's life and others ' lives happier .

1656,280564.txt,P6,SPA,high,"When we talk about traveling a lot of things comes to our mind like prices , places to visit , time to expend in such place and if is good to be led by a tour guide or not .
I think the best way to travel is by oneself , without a tour guide .
There are many reasons that support my idea .
For example oneself could visit other places not offered in the tour , design their own schedule , and skip non interesting places .

In a tour the guide take their group of tourists to an especific place , already planned by the travel agency .
In contrast , without a tour guide oneself could go wherever he/she want .
For instance , I traveled to Toronto and I found interesting travel to places by myself .
I had the chance to talk to people from the city and ask them the best places to visit from their point of view , they know better than tour guides .

In a planned tour , the tourist have an schedule to follow .
I prefer to plan my own schedule , according to my interest and necesities .
For example , what if I want to go and relax all day on the beach .
If I have the chance to elaborate my schedule .
I can adjust my plans to visit other places in order to get what I want .

Finally , some tour agencies have tour plans to visit places that are important to certain type of people .
I went to visit Florida for my vacations and I had bad luck because I traveled with a group of old people .
They were not interested in visit places like Busch Gardens or exiting theme parks like Universal Studios .
They just wanted to stay at the beach , or go to quiet places .
If I would traveled by myself without a tour guide , I would visited theme parks with those exiting roller coaster , or visited beaches full of young women .

In general , I consider a better option to travel without a tour guide .
The experience is more exiting and suit to oneself interest .

4242,738187.txt,P1,TEL,medium,"In general , it is better to have both the tasks i.e. , Broad knowledge of many academic subjects and also specialization in particular subjects .
Depending on the present concern , i prefer specialization in one specific subject rather than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
Having specialization in one specific subject shows ones own interest in picking particular subject of greater importance in the present trend of education .
I prefer this because having broad knowledge on many academic subjects is of no use as all the academic subjects may not carry equal importance .

Additionally , specialize in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is that we cannot have the ability to analyze the problems in all the subjects efficiently .
This will make me more strong to have good command on one particular subject than having a broad knowledge of various academic subjects .

Finally , i choose specialization in one specific subject superior to broad knowledge of various academic subjects is that we will be able to take up any challenge or if any problem in that particular subject can be efficiently sorted out with the command or the specialization on a particular subject .
This efficiency cannot be achieved by having a broad knowledge over a subject .

Ultimately , i believe that the specialization in one subject is better than having a broad knowledge of academic subjects because we will be able to master that particular subject and also we can select the subject depending on the person 's interest and also the present boom for that particular subject .
This is because , all the academic subjects may not be so important to learn so deeper .
This makes me very strong to prefer specialization in one specific subject over having broad knowledge of many academic subjects .

3477,603456.txt,P7,SPA,high,"There is this theory that it is more importante for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts , I desagree .

I believe a student should both learn facts and understand ideas and concepts , because good education must be based on both rather than focussing on one or the other .

For instance , a student must understand the concept of democracy in order to study history , but he also must learn some relevant events in history to fully understand the meaning of the concept democracy .

I believe the learning of facts is not contrary to the understanding of ideas and concepts , in the long run , you may forget a lot of the facts you were thought , but at some point they were absolutelly necessary to understand the underlying concepts and ideas .

Throughout ones life we forget and learn facts as we continue in the process of understanding new concepts and ideas .

An education based solely on facts will produce students who are unable to conect those facts and produce original ideas and opinions , while an education based exclusivelly on understanding will make for adults not fit to interact in a cultivated enviroment .

The basic approach to education has changed significantly in the last 50 years , our parents were thought rough facts , they were forced to memorize endless ammount of information to be repeated over and over again , while younger generations were brought up under the impresion that memorizing facts is useless , in my opinion , neither is desirable , nor the student who is full of facts but lacks in analisys , nor the student who doesnt know the names or the most important capitals of the world or the basic facts in its countrys history .

I also believe education should be balance because students will be likely to study in diferent institutions throughout their lives and a well rounded education allows them to better adapt to the different teachig methodologies and approaches to education that each particular institution has .

841,137466.txt,P7,ARA,low,"Studants must understand ideas and concepts , on the other hand they must learn facts also .
But the question is : what is better for them ???
Well as I see , learning facts is more important , becsause ideas and concepts depend on the person who give it to us , in another words , its may different from one person to other , so whats the reason of understand this ?
On other hand facts , are as it is , in all the world , everytime and everywhere .

For example , '' Womes must work in order to help her Husband '' Somebody agree , others do n't .
Well , sombody says she has to work because she is a human as her husband , so she must work outside home , not only her husband .
Others says , she is a WOMAN if she worked outside maybe somebody will hit her or even do n't be faire with her because she is a lady .
Here is an idea the first reason is more powrfull than the other , so what we will gain if we study ideas ???

But if we studied facts , such as Theory Of Gravity .
In this case we will improve our knowledge , know whats happen in the world and maybe we will take it for a research in order to get a Depluma on Physics or any other higher level .
If we looked everywhere in colleges we will notice that almost of the study is studying facts .
Also , what is a student ??
Student is a person who study to graduate from a recognized college , recognized from all over the world , so how can he study idea or concept and being recognized ?
Recognized means that there is no doubt that he is right , so if he study a concept , what will happen if he is not on right way ??
he will lose everything he did for nothing .

And everybody has his own opinion .

First , I think now is information society .

Now there are many kind of materials .

they constrate their things .
Internet , TV game are very fun more than to helping their communities .

Second , I think now is individual society .
People are selfish .
Current 's people are very busy .
I think ancient ages 's time more slowly .
People must do something everyday .
They do n't have sufficient free time .
Especially , yong people must go to school , study hard to take high level education .

Third , I think they want to helping their communities , however , they do n't know how to care about community .
Now , They do n't have many brother or sister .
And , They were playing indoor .
I think they do n't know how to communication another people .
However , they want to take care about communities .

First af all , I see that my grand-parents enjoy as well as me their personal time because they do a lot of things , they travel and they do some little works .
They are very busy with the family because they also care my little young cousins .

I could be agree with this sentence in a different meaning like the possibility for young people to do more like sports for exemple .
Maybe some old people do n't have envoy to do because they are also old in their mind .
My grand-parents are very young in their way of thinking , in their souls .
Despite the pass of the years , they are always the same and sometimes I say to my grand-mother to be calm or quiet because she does n't have twenty years and she ca n't do transport some heavier things for exemple .

It 's funny to describe that because I realize that I 'm lucky to have them , a very good exemple for my future .
Of course I think that other old people do n't want to do the same things of when they were young because they are tired or they have some pain .
It 's difficult to be old because you have to minimize your activities and generally you do n't want .

I think that all the `` epochs '' of the man 's life have something interesting to do , to accomplain ...
Old people could for exemple go to a university to obtain an education that they ca n't acquire when they were young , for different reasons like to war or the poor conditions of the families .

I have a cousin that go into a university of the `` Terza Eta ' ( third age ) and he 's enthousiastic of this possibility .

4508,784347.txt,P3,JPN,low,"I agree this opinion .
I have three reasons about this .
First , the age of communities is growing up .
There are usually many older people in the communities with enlonging the mean age .
Older people have many witness , skills and cultures , so young people have to absorb it to heridate the new generation .
Indeed Young people are difficult talk with older people because the interested thing are quites different .
We have to get those things .

Second , it is safty to protect our communities themselves .
The ratio of damaging by the thives could decrese with power of protecting themselves .
In fact , it is possible to decrese it by walking around the communities at night .
We are be too careful to close at doors and windows as possible as we can , but thieves are often appears .
It is necessary to prevent from invading thieves with communities powers .

Finally , humans live with groups .
We cannot live alone .
While young age , it is little opportunities to be helped by other people .
If they need , they take a telepone some friends at long distance .
They get not helps but opinions , we can put it off .
"
1651,279504.txt,P8,FRA,medium,"I do n't believe this question can be answered by yes or no .
It all depends on the people , on the activities of these people and in the period they live in .

In the industrial revolution for example , you had to try something new to be successful because the activities were changing .
An activity in which one might have performed well suddenly got surpassed and that person was forced to change his activity .
The people who made the right changes became rich , others who had put their bets on the wrong horses became poor .

In the actual time both ways are possible to become successful .
The first way would be to stick to something you know you can do well , but you have to do it better than everybody else .
That usually is n't possible without investments and the risks that go with it .
So I think that , in most cases , there is no success without taking risks .

Another path to success would be to try something new .
In that case the risks are usually higher , but if it was the right thing to do , the rewards are higher too .
The difficulty here is that you have to get into the right thing at the right time .
The advantage by trying something new is that if the new thing does n't launch off , you can still go back to what you can do well .
If that happens you probably wo n't get really successful , but you have tried .
But to try something new is n't possible to everybody .
To get into a new thing requests the right ideas and much bravery .
Most people stay in what they 're doing , even if they 're unhappy , because they do n't have the guts to make a change .

In conclusion I would say that the most important factors for success are bravery , to take risks ; luck , to be in the right activity at the right time , the character to want to be better then the others and fantasy , to have the ideas .
Of course , you also need the skills to then lead your activity to success .

2019,348802.txt,P8,TUR,high,"Inventing the Wheel Again

The method for being sucessful in life is not written on an ancient egyptian scroll .
In today 's world no one can really determine what will be a hit or not .
Inventing a new things is sure necessity to be sucessful , but one should not blindly take risks in the sake of it .
One 's experience is his best treasure and his best guide for reaching sucess .
Successful people improve on what they already do well .

Imagine someone who wants to be a good swimmer .
He first learns freestyle and as soon as he learns it enough to look good , he starts learning butterfly , backstroke , breastroke and so on .
While a competitor chooses his best stroke to be freestyle and puts just the same energy and time to freestyle only .
The first swimmer can race and be good in all styles but when he races freestyle , the second swimmer will win .
Success in sports is similar to success in life for many things .
If one does n't focus on one thing and learn it quite well he wo n't improve on it .
Successful people plant their strategies well and work on the things they already know to improve themselves .

In order to be sucessful in a subject one should bring something new into that subject .
In order to bring in something new to the table , one should first know what 's been put on the table .
Successful people who has experience on their subjects already know not only what has been done upto that point , but also they understand what is needed next .
Someone looking at a picture from outside cannot see the next step , cannot see what that businness field is lacking and what would be a big gap filing invention .
Taking a risk on new things without and experience on it is like driving in dark with no headlights .

Being successful does not mean doing only what has been done up to that point without chaning it .
Successful people always re-invent and improve things in their fields .
The first rule of being successful is not stopping and always improving on what one have .

Success stories are based on doing dramatic things .
However it is only a fair luck to be successful in a field by just taking risks and trying new things .
New things are necessary for improvement and success .
But for new things , experience is a must .
Successful people are the ones that try new things in the light of their experiences .
"
1879,323858.txt,P8,FRA,medium,"People do things by differents ways .
Succeful ones try new things and take risks instead of using ways they already know .
I agree with this statement for many reasons .

Successful people used to find out new ways of doing well even if they already know others successsful roads .
It is because of their need to have more success and also need to be more proud of them .
Because they want proov them and people than they merited their ttle of SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE .
so they take more and more risks to increase , if they succeed their fame .

In addition when you are a person who succeed , you have to continue but not to be contented of what you already are .
Because ther is a hioghly degree of fighting spirit .
For example , a very successful company of cell communication , which is faced to a new one whose prices are more availabable than hers must take risks by cutting down her prices in order to have more profits .
It is a new popularity and money entrance .

All the same , even if having experience and use it is important , test new methods is also good , because people do not finish learning and must try to increase their abilities by trying more ideas .
So there a popular short word : If do not risk , you wil have nothings .
Successful people are knows as persons who are couragious , fighting , and humble .

Because of all these previewing reasons successful usually try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
From my point of view it is right .
Being more successful are important for successful people and they used to choose this way .
It is a paradix but it also law of the nature .
But some people only do that .
everybody has choice .

9352,1496452.txt,P2,DEU,high,"I would agree with the statement , even though I must admit that the question if young people enjoy life more than old people do , is certainly very difficult to answer , because you have to compare people out of different times and social structures , with very different problems , options , possibilities and wishes .

Let me first shortly explain the background , out of which most - if not all - older people that I know come : Most of them experienced war or the time after war ; a time full of scarcity and poverty .
Everyone had to work very hard for his life .
When there was money left , it was seldomly simply spent for something like holidays or having a fine dinner or theater .
It was rather saved for bad times that could probably come again .
They preferred - or perhaps were forced by society and expectations put on them - to go on working rather than enjoying life or doing something for themselves , just to be secure .
Over the decades , life got easier of course and also those people learned to enjoy life .
But I think that in most older people there is still always this feeling of first work , then enjoy their own life .

On the other hand , life for young people today is also certainly hard and not easy , since they have a lot of pressure to bear , implied on them from school , study or job .
But I think they grew up in a society in which enjoying life is something other people make money with .
Its a business - enjoying life is something like a symbol for wealth which is highly promoted in advertisement and marketing .
Furthermore , it is socially accepted to enjoy life , to go on holidays , to visit bars , restaurants , cinema or to subscribe for a wellness-week .

For these reasons I think its easier and more common among young people to enjoy life than for old people .

We all want , try and work for it .
Have you ever thought of the first and the best comman qualification of successful people ?
I thought and share with you : always try new things , be creative and have self-confidence to take risks .
When you look around you will see the most successful ones are the ones who take the radical ideas and do not worry to give life to them .
First ; The old needings of human are the best reason for new things .
If you do not worry about if it will be liked by everyone you will become a great candidate for a successful people .
For example when the television first invented nobody thougt it would spread so rapidly but the inventors belived and now we see what happened clearly .

Secondly , new things mean creativity and i belive you do not need anything in your entire life if you had creativity .
Creative people always achive success , near or far one day they see its helps .
For example in the TV competition called Survivor : it is a coompetiton about human against nature : there is an island and men with nothing .
The competitors are similar in their physical conditions but their creativity make the difference .

Lastly , taking risks .
If you do not worry about others thoughts and have a selfconfidence there is nothing to stop you to success .
In my country there is a man without arms and legs he lost them in a train accident when he was 5 .
But now he is one of the greatest swimmers of my country hemaybe compete in Olympics soon .
He did not mentione the risks can occure when he was swimming .
All he has is self-confidence and belief in himself .

Consequently , i think successful people try new thingns , are creative and has enormous self-confidence to take risks .
If you have these qualifications i believe one day you will be very successful too .

Learning is a process that accompanies us until the day of our death .

Personally the fact of having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject

Depending on the field , knowing about a variety of matters will give the person a broader overview of the topic in which he is trying to specialize .
The knowledge of more fields than the one he is interested in will give him more possibilities to link his necessities with a particular information available .

The more skills a person gets will allow this person to perform in more fields .
Not necessarily mastering all of them , but knowing enough to face any situation .

On the other hand , the ones who focus their energies on a particular subject are being on the risk of becoming too good on the preferred bussiness that can not draw their attention to something else productive and constructive as well .
The neurosurgeon who has a flood in his house will not be able to handle emergency scenarios like this because of his total ignorance about plumbing .
I would not say that all neurosurgeons are urged to take a plumbing course or something similar , but the point is that knowing some basics about how to use this tools or being aware of the water or sewing system around the house this person will be ready to perform first-hand measures to save his house until getting specialized help .

Because , using a new thing can help people learn more stuff , can catch the line of world 's change , having fun by working in new things .

4722,823461.txt,P6,KOR,medium,"I had a trip to Che-ju island in my country , Korea , with my friends , and it was a trip that led by a tour guide .
After the journey , there were more bad memories than good ones , because of these reasons ; caanot choosing visit places , and the problem of extra fees .
For my experiences , I disagree with the opinion that the tour group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel .

First of all , People robbed their rights to choosing the spots to visit , If the travel team is organezed and led by a tour guide , people of the the team have to follow the schedule which is made by the guide .
For example , I could n't visit the museum which exhibit the numerous kinds of unique plants grown only in Han-ra mountain in Che-ju island .
Instead of that , we merely followed the typical travel courses like teddy bear museum , and restaurants that sells black pig .
How waste of time !!
I can see such a thing not only in the island , but in my town .
To follow the schedule we had to sacrifice our right to decide where to go .

In addition , going travel with a guide is too costly .
There are many so called ` options ' that we can choose whether we will experience it or not .
However , in reality , the ` options ' are not option as it means literally .
The guide makes people to do , or sometimes buy something madatorilly .
and of coures it is not conclued in the travel fee people already paid .
To illustrate this , a TV program in Korea revealed the reality of the ` option ' system .
They research about that , and conducted a survey to the people who experience the guide tour .
Most of them did n't wanted to do the program , but compelled to do that by the reason that if someone does n't participate alon , then he or she will break the harmony of the team .
Furthermore , about 90 % of them disappointed to the cost , and quality of the optional programs they had experienced .
It shows how expensive to tour with a guide .

In conclusion , I disagree with the view that the tour with guide is the best way of travel , because we cannot go where we wish to go , and have to pay for the extra fees for optional program , As for me who experienced such a bad-memoried-trip , I am planning to go Euroup next summer with my own preparation , and organization .

6619,1078433.txt,P3,DEU,high,"I would like to discuss the statement that young people do not spend enough time to help and suopport the community they are living in .

To my mind young people nowadays spend less time helping their communities than they did some decades ago but you should consider that there are quite a lot of things that have dramatically changed over the past few years .
Now , there are many new services offered by the government that give us the opportunity to spend our time doing something else than working for our community .
An example for this would be the improved helthcare system : Some time ago , it was nearly impossible to work in full-time job if one of your relatives was very ill and needed permanent care and help .
Today , you just have to apply for special services that are paid by the insurance and you will be given help .

However , there are still some some services which cannot be provided and / or paid by the community .
In those cases ( i.e staff at the fire brigades , ambulance drivers , trainers at sports clubs etc . )
there is indeed kind of a shortage .
In my free time , I am working as an ambulance driver without being paid for this .
Often have I experieced situations in which we ran out of personnel because nobody wanted to work on the weekend or wanted to stay up all night .
I wish that in those cases , more people would recognize how important their contribution would be .

All in all , I think that we do indeed need a young generation that spends more time helping their communities than many people do now , but we only need their support in some fields .
So my suggestion would be to try to make some advertisement and promotion in order to show them how much fun it can be to play an active role in society and to help them to find the right kind of occupation for them .

4187,727446.txt,P7,DEU,high,"There have always been varying opinons on the importance of learning facts or in contrast the understanding of ideas while studying .
In my opinion the way a student should handle his stdudying depends first very much on the relevant field of study .
For example studying history requires the knowledge of certain historical data .
These are facts tha have to be learned , they can not be derived frim the understanding of a concept .
So there is an importance for the students to learn them .

On the other hand studying economics , the are a lot of models and ideas the students have to understand in order to be sucessful .
Those can no be learned ..
But can the student of history gain success in his studying only by learning facts ?
No he can not .
He also has to understand for example the strutures of ancient societies .

And can the student of economies be a good econimist just by understanding many of the econimic models and ideas ?
Again no .
There is also the need to combine this understanding with certain facts or formulars that simply have yo be learned .

Another important fact is also the type of person one student is .
Some people can keep fact they have read in their minds easily , but its hard for them to understand concepts behind .
Others have diffculties in remembering facts , but are likely to draw right conclusions from concepts they have understood once .

So it can not be said that simply learning facts , or understanding ideas is the key to sucessful studying .
The solution should be a sensible mixture of the two extremes .
Depending on what the aim of studying is and also depending on what one 's preferences and talent are .

As far as I am concerned , I agree that successful people only try new things and taks risks .
In my opinion that successful people must have some kinds of the special capacibilitis that normal people do n't have .
These are my opinions in the following reasons .

First of all , I wander that what kind of people will have a lots of guts to become successful ?
They must obtain a greatness dream to stimulate them keep moving on .
For example , if they want to finish this hard work that boss ask for them to do , they must work on harder and harder , even no time to eat .
This target is one they want to achieve and want to get the boss 's praise , so they take the risk may become unhealth to conqure the goal .

Secondly , no pain , no gain .
I indicate the people who are willing to take the risk must have the scene of confidance .
For stance , there ca n't be complete the whole thing without confidance .
however , the successful people show their confidance in when they are find the way to deal with the problems and figure out the tough issues .

Moreover , the hard-wroking people represence the most confidance when they have no ways to do , they can utilize their individual ability to overcome the problems .

To sum up , I utter that the successful peopole that try new thing and take risks make them become success .
In the end , I will conclude my opinions by emphasizing .
People need to have the creatibility to think the new methods to deal with problems , espesially when they get stuck in the awful way .

696,114151.txt,P8,DEU,high,"Overall , I agree with the statement .
Progress of individuals and of society as a whole has always been based on taking risks and exploring new options .
Not only would the known world not include America , had Christopher Columbus not taken the risk of sailing thousands of miles in a frail little boat , we would also still be traveling on foot instead of using cars , planes and submarines .
While trodden paths can tak us through everyday situations , success requires us to see and , more importantly , use oppotunities .
However , the key to success is not taking every possible risk , but to recognize and take those risks that one can benefit from most .

A successful manager will not avoid risks , but rather weigh them against their potential benefit and then decide to his best knowledge .
A successful general will not seek to avoid confrontations but choose a battlefield that gives him advantage over his enemy .
On the other hand , someone driving at night at a high speed without headlights takes a considerable risk without apparent peronal benefit and might be called a stupid rather than a successful person .

Taken together , I think that an intelligent balance between risk and benefit distinguishes a successful person from the average or outright dumb .
Simply taking risks does not .

355,63189.txt,P1,HIN,high,"The question whether to have a broad knowledge of many acedemics subjects OR to specialise in one specific subject is a very arguable and can lead to many a heated discussions .

In my opinion , it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than to just have expertice in one .

According to me , the practical value of a person increases when he know about various other subjects apart from his major .
This makes him a lot more versatile and flexible .
He can take care of a lot of things without external assistance and thus can prove to be an asset .

Moreover , in todays world , one has to be aware of a lot of things to make himself as well his family prosper .
For example , a doctor by profession has to have a basic knowledge of electricity and safely measures of electrical appliances to safely operate the appliances .
If he does not pay enough attention to this , and only be expert at his profession then he may unintentionally cause an accident .
Also for example , a Chartered Accountant needs to know the basics of first aid in order to administer the same when the need arises .
In the same way a Contruction Worker needs to know the basics of taxation where he can save a dollar more .
Hence for a comfortable living in todays world , one needs to have a practical knowledge of a variety of subjects .

Seeing in the practical aspect , this opinion is reflected in the corporate world also .
We dont have a lot of experts of scientific or civil fields .
The reason for this is the amount of extra effort that they have to put in to become an expert .
To further explain this , the time when a student starts learning the contents of a subject , I believe , he is not mature enough to decide whether this is what he actually wants to expertise in .
He is unaware of the other subjects and possibilities that lay ahead in them .
For making a sound decision , one has to spend some time in knowing the subjects and then deciding .
In we take this approach practically then , by the time a student gets aquainted to all the subjects his learning time has lapsed biologically and he thus becomes Jack of All but master of none .
But there are a few exeptional ones who do pursue specialised education and become specialists in their fields .

Hence I feel that , the choice should afterall be of the student to decide between Master or Jack .
But given a choice , I would prefer to be a Jack rather than a master .

8327,1299334.txt,P4,ITA,medium,"I think it is true that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
In my opinion it happens particularly during spots on television : in fact each of us can remember that he brought something because it was introduced very well , or because the spot was really nice or interesting .
It happens because the power of tv is too much strong , in fact each of us has a tv and watches it every day .

All the reasons that cause this phenomenum concerne business , in fact industries use spots to convince people that their products are very useful and they always insist about the good quality of them .

In my opinion sometimes producers lie because they want to be richer and richer , but sometimes they lie because they live in a critical economic period , even if I do n't want to justify them .

In fact we must consider that in the period of globalisation a lot of products have generated a real invasion of market all over the world , and it is very difficult for industries to defend their products because the competition with other products is hard .
About this aspect we can remember the most important new element of global economic , that is represented by the Chinese market .
This market through its low prices causes a real crisis of modern economy and forces a lot of European or American industries to be more competitive .

As a result a lot of this industries try to send their products by doing false advertisements about their qualities .
I think it is completely wrong because the customers always want to buy faithful products , characterised by a real good quality ; so if they are not satisfied by things they buy , they will change products immediately , particularly in the period of globalisation , during which you can find a big variety of products .

This time , they shoud support young people like they let old people support who support them before .

1023,167685.txt,P2,ZHO,high,"Life is like a virgin forest , with primitive mountains , rivers , grassland and flowers in it .
You cannot pick a peak out of it without exploring or probing the true face of it .
So does age .
Different age-experiences enable us to interprete the codes of life , the different primes in life , the dynamic enjoyments by walking through life .
Hence , I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I believe different age groups can experience the identical happiness or joy by appreciating the different beauty inside of their life .

First of all , it is believed that all ages have its prime .
20s means smartness and quickness , 30s encountering diligence and perseverence , while 60s sounds sophistication and wisdom .
They just focus on different strength .
It does not deny or differ their enjoyment in life .
Many Nobel Prize winners who achieved their biggest professional peak , enjoy the happiness of it when they are wellknown and prestigious in their later years .
They had a particularly hard time in proving their hyposis or theory in their youth , like Albert Einstein , Nikola Tesla .

Secondly , happiness is a lifetime pursuit .
People through all age bracket seek for the real joy of life .
Many sayings tell us the happiness does not discriminate ages .
A wise , intelligent novel or person can win high praise despite of the age of the author .

Furthermore , many people think the life is too short to waste .
So , during their youth , most of their endeavors contribute their career , family and friendship .
While , retired people can enjoy their interest , develop their skills since they got more free time .
Can we say that only young people enjoy a better life than older one .

In conclusion , I support the idea that all ages deserve the right to be happy as long as they explore the beautiful colors of each age and pursue the real value of each age bracket .
That is the color of life .

2006,345566.txt,P8,HIN,high,"Yes i agree with the statemen , `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' as people gain success they experiment with new ideas and takes risks of implementing those ideas .
The main purpose of this experiment is to increase their growth and success in fields other than what they already know perfectly .

For most of the successful people success is not the only goal , but their goal is an increase in success with the passing time .
I think risks must be taken so as to explore other fields inorder to achieve success .
Success of an individual depends mainly on his self confidence and his skills in adapting what he dont know .

Trying out something is the basic step of attaining success or failure .
Only after trying out something that is new people are directed towards success or failure and in case of success people try to expertise themselves in that particular field and later on try for some new things to add on to their success .

An organization which is successful in providing people with a soft drink of a particular flavour will later on take a risk of trying out something new by introducing a new drink , if it fails then the drink may be withdrawn from the market but in case of success the gain a huge business and sales .

Success it attained by dedication , hardwork and skills , a successful person feels independent and keeps on trying new paths or ideas to increase their success .
But people who dont try new ideas maintain the same position at which they are present since a long time .

Success is achieved by taking riks and implying new ideas , new ideas are helpful steps and a right path for people who are successful .

I am thinking that older people could enjoy their life .

Evidently , young people are busy to prepare their future life .
Specially , after starting school , they spend the most of time to study and learn skills .
Also , they have a lot of questions of real life as they are growing and try to figure out the problelm through talk with friends or parents .
They could enjoy life to spend time with friends but this is not enjoying .
I would like to say that is one of learning how to stand between people in our society .

Some young people are not like that I mention in above .
They are just spend time for fun .
They do not thinking about their future .
However , in this case is not only for all of young generation .

On the other hand , older people could enjoy their life .
They have comfortable time and money .
Older people who have a career on their job and good health , of caurse they can do .
Also , it cuold be good model to young gerneration .
Even my parents usually have a short trip together on weekend .

5076,884203.txt,P5,FRA,medium,"I cannot say if there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today , because there are a lot of things to take into account to have an opinion .

On the one hand , there are more and more regulations about cars in big cities to avoid pollution and make inhabitants of towns feel better .
People want to be able to walk on the street without feeling oppressed by the cars there are around them , the noise they create and they want also to smell other things than petrol .

In addition , nobody knows whether there will be enough petrol in twenty years so that everybody can use one 's car as much as one uses it today .
If petrol becomes less and less available and , therefore , more and more expensive , people will have to find new solutions to move from one place to another .
I think it is totally possible because there are a lot of means of transport which waste much less petrol than cars .
For exemple , people could take the train or the bus , or even their bike .
The main problem is that they are used to driving their car at each time they need to go out from their home , so they do not think to take their bike instead , or to walk .
When driving will have become too expensive for the majority of people , one will learn to live without one 's car , and people will probably enjoy it .

On the other hand , the cars industry is still growing and brands are developping new models which are more comfortable , better designed and possess all the new technologies .
They want people to keep buying their new cars so I think that they are going to do their best to attract customers , especially if the trend confirms that people give up using their car .

The fisrt group may give some reason to support their idea , because facts can be consider a logical conseguence of the ideas and the concept , and if a student understand the ideas and the concept he can learn fact easylier and quicklier .

The second says that for a student is more important to learn a fact and not to understand ideas and concept , because the history is do by the fact and not by the ideas or the concept .

As far as I 'm concerned , I perfectly agree with rason of the second group of people , in fact I think that for a student is more important to learn facts than it is for them to undestand ideas and comcepts , because in my opinion facts is the application of ideas and conception , and if a student learn facts he has more help to understand the concepts .

For example if I must study the second world war for me is more important learn facts and not what ideas or what concepts there are under the facts .
For example if i study the german 's invasion of poland I learn the fact , but from this fact I can understand that the Nazism 's project is to conquist all the world and this project starts from the Poland .

Finally I think that a student must learn the fact because from fact he understands the ideas and the concepts that there are under the facts and not more important in the history text for example the question is about the fact and not about the ideas , this is only an example , but it is another reason for me that is more important to learn facts .

3222,558522.txt,P1,TEL,medium,"I agree with the topic given that is `` It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject '' .
First of all i agree with the topic because when you have a good knowledge on the academic subjects you can do well in the upcoming future .
Because now-a-days no one is looking for specific task that they has to perform so thats the reason one should have the concepts of all academic subjects .

For example considering an civil engineer he should be able to handle all the problems which will occcur during the desinging , construction and finally during the final estimated cost of the plan which he has to do the project , so he able to handle the problems which are going to occur during soil investigation , planning and desinging of a structure .
This example explains as a part of a civil engineers view .

Another example is that now-a-days the software companies are looking for proffessional students never bothered about to which branch they are related and also they are giving training about the work they had to do for the company and they are selecting on the basis of the academic subjects what they had .

From my point of view everyone should have a overall view about the all academic subjects to improve their sklls regarding and they can furnish knowledge on every subject and they can move relatedly to their work which can improve their living and they can be lived happily whatever resources they are getting from each topic and also they can improve their knowledge about the latest techniqes are going to come and accordingly they can improve their strategies what they had about the latest techniques .

Finally my conclusion regarding to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one subject is that we can improve our knowledge on each subject and its modifications can also be studied to benefit ourselves and can live a better life which should be foremost important to us .
This makes my conclusion about the topic `` It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject '' .

It makes you feel uncomfortable .
And if you lost your way alone , you also feel un comfortabl because you know little giography in foreign country .

Also , since your travel is in group led by a tour guide , you would visit good place which information book of this country do n't list .
So , a guide has many information about many places which you might not know .
After that , as you are in a group , you probable do n't lose your way .
if you might lose your way , someone would announce you not to go so far from here .

Next , you can go to places which you want to go on time because a travel tour is supposed to be on time .
So , if a certain travel tour match your ideas which you are supposed to go to somewhere , it is best for you .

In additional , a travel tour certainly contains hotel to stay for you , tickets of rounf trip , breakfasts , lunchs , dinners , and some options .

But is it important to have a braod knowledge of many subjects or is it better to specialize in one specific subject .
You can earn more acknowledgement if you know as much as possible in one subject .
That can be explained in many reasons .

First , when you are a specialist in one subject , it is more possible to go deeper in the material .
You can do a scientific research and firgure out why are these or this problem .
With that knowledge it is possible to investigate things .
For example , if you are in the economic word you are able to understand what happens .
This could not work if you only know a few methods .

Second , people , which you make a academic conversation , have really more trust in you , when you have deeper knowledge .
When talking about the dollar 's weakness against the euro , it does not make sense to talk about it without that specific kwnowledge .
You are able to discuss and to investigate .
People almost ever argue to each other on a high level .

On the other hand having braod knowledge of many subjects can be puzzling sometimes .
Keep in mind that you have a lot of knowledge .
It could be difficult to explain something when you are not certain about the problem .

In conclusion i mean knowledge in one specialize subject is the best way .

9934,1609400.txt,P5,ARA,medium,"I certainly hope this statment would be true , as I wish to agree with it .
But unfortuantly , I do n't agree , as reality implies opposite fact .
As i grew up , i have been noticing people changing their cars every now and then , i usually did n't care , but when it was time for me to get a car , i felt how important it is to ride a car that comfort me and get me to any where i wish to go .
And i realized why people were so interested to changtheir cars .

It 's either they did n't like their car model anymore , or maybe they just want to get the latest car .
However , being this tramendous change in car manufactering world wide affects all people , in terms of age or genders .
Now not only men interested in cars , but also women .

Even though most of the well famous car manufactering coorporations are trying to suit what is the best comfart car for a women , in terms of color , mirrors on both the front sits , where the driver located .

Also , certain type of cars were introduced for a small or a big family .
Nonetheless , the types of cars introduced , there are so many and uncountable .
Alot of different car industries are growing so fast due to the competition between them to produce most high technical and comfortable car with less maintanence , with ofcourse , the shape it has of modern looks and colors .

Many people are very impressed with the very high technology applied in cars nowadays , from the car 's shape till the car 's performence .
And lets never forget that cars now serves us in many of ways .
Any family ca n't live without a car , and thats a reality everyone should admit , as in case if you do n't have a car instead you can take another tarnsporting mean .
Which at the end is a car , going anywhere , to your work place or for visting someone or even travelling near or far still requires a car .

Car 's serves us in many ways , that makes me doubt that in twenty years will be fewer , even if telecommuting took place instead of going to yout place , and replacing cars with any other mean of transportation like for example airoplanes , it will be so diffecult to adopt to such a diffecult mean .
Cars just makes life easier in terms of tarnsporting .

10660,1738777.txt,P7,ZHO,medium,"There is a famous saying that says , `` all facts are made out of prejudice of our ancestors . ''
Hence , I agree with the statement .
Although facts can be seen as a short cut toward studying , I belive it is more important to teach the students ideas and concepts then lead them toward the knowing facts .
Going though this process , the student may have a changeable mind and an ability to turn ideas and concepts into facts .

If the teachers in school teaches only fact , the people who study there will become computers , for they only have to remember the text and they can pass the exams .
On the other side , the students have more challange and will learn more .
For example , if a biology teacher only teaches a frog is a slimy kind of animal that can live in both water and land , can the students pick the right animal when a turtle and a frog is presented to him .
On contrasy , if the students are given the idea of learning by experiencing themselves , the differences of the two animal shall be easy .

Another reason that I agree more on learning ideas and concepts are , most of the great inventions are started .
Youngs should learn how the great scientist acheve their success by starting on ideas and concepts others never or do not dare to think of .
Explaining the reflextion of a water based on the idea of light that run between the water and the face is more educational than just telling them , `` because there is a reflextion it is true . ''

Most importantly the students need to learn is the process between the ideas to the facts .
It is how things work and knowledge form , from the question you find to the solution you make after cutting out all the other posibilities .
Only if they get this ability , they can learn more and learn deep into the subject , and they can find the useful facts for life .
Therefore , by only understanding the process between the ideas and concepts to the facts , the students may really learn something useful for their lives .

The question of the best academical system is not solved yet , and many scholars continue to propose alternative ways to teach .
If we take a close look at the way education is organised in France , in Germany or in the United States , we immediately realise that many different approaches are possible .

How the professor should act in front of his students is not an easy question to answer .
To claim whether a solution is better than another may seem , I acknowledge , a bit pretentious .
But I am deeply convinced that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .
Learning facts and figures are , in my opinion , the worst thing you can do in a university

What we are asking to a student nowadays , is to understand and to analyse immediately the situation he/she faces .
This is what we call , the ability to react in front of an unexpected situation .
This skill does not appear alone ; it must be worked and practised .

The student must be able to think on his proper way , but he has also have to master some important theories which are the basis of our common and recognised society .
For example , you cannot speak about the evolution of the species without referring to Darwin .

But , once this general basis of common knowledge is acquired , then the student is perfectly able to evolve by himself .
Our society should not be made of people only good at repeating what they have heard , but of people who are creative , imaginative , original .

The possibility offered by an university to learn and discover a whole range of new knowledge , is certainly one of the most important thing ever .
It would be a shame to spoil this unique opportunity by being occupied with the learning of figures that would be forgotten almost immediately .

Anyway , recently , the priority has been given to the free will of the student .
The curiosity and the knowledge of every students must be aimed at the improval of our society .
Understanding ideas and concepts may be compared to the keys which lead to the achievment of such a goal .

Since many people are concerned about the problem , in twenty years , will there be fewer cars in use than there are today ?
Personally , I would say `` yes '' .
The reasons go as follows .

First , since the citizens suffer a lot from the traffic congestion in daily life , more people would choose not to buy a car , and find the alternative way to transport convieniently .
For example , a officer who go to work by car may not attend an important meeting on time , if he is unfortunately being delayed by the crowded traffic in the rush hour .
However , if he could take a bus or MRT , things

Secondly , gorvernment in many countries spend huge money in developing their public commuting system , such as MRT .
Considering the advantages of these system , like huge accommodation , convience , and safety , gorvernment are encourged to invest on these public transportation system .
It can be infered that with a well-developed public commuting system , the citizens would prefer to utilize the facility as possible as they can .

Finally , with the rising price of oil , having a private car would become a burden to those car-owners .
When it comes to oil , we may deem it as precious resource on earth .
Therefore , the rising price of oil is a natural thing .
Not buying or using a car would be a wise method to save the money spending on oil .
Furthermore , this could reduce the pollution produced by the oil .

Above all , it can be concluded that the fear of traffic congestion , the government 's effort in building public commuting system , and the expensive cost of oil will undoubtedly make people decide not to buy a car .
In that way , there will be fewer cars in twenty years .

I personally disagree with that statement .
WHY ?
I have experienced that many people in may surrounding spend much time in helping their / my community .
Let me give you an example .
I know many people who give evening - courses for pupils in their age for being better in school and that for free !
Another quit good example is the group of some pupils who meet older people / seniors during christmas-time for giving some hope and the feeling of being part of the society and I personally think that this is a great supportment for the whole community in a city .
There are also some young people in my surrounding who created an anti-drug club for preventing youngsters and also older people from taking drugs and / or commiting crime .
I do not want to show that topic onesided , I mean I clearly know some people who have not taken part in a free social programm instead they prefer watching TV , playing computergames the whole envening or night , disturbing other people , stealing or destroying things but I think the majority of the youngsters I know are really motivated in doing things for the community , just because of fun and avoiding to be bored by a situation .
I know in other societies ( china ) pupils have to work for their family and others instead of wasting the time because it is traditional .
But relating to the statement , what is enough time to help the community ?
I think it is quit enough when someone also do only a half hour or less every day for the community .
So it is clear that it is up to everyone to do what he wants to do but I think everyone has also the task to show respect for the community itself and for what they do for every part of the society you live in .

I have two points supports that , the more convenient public transportation and the oil more expensive .

Firstly , in my living country , Taiwan , there is a smaller place than most of counties .
It spends 5 or 6 hours from north to sounth .
If you want to around the iland , it just take 2 or 3 days .
Because of that , Taiwan have good public transport system .
If you want to go this place to another place far away downtown , you just have to check which bus you can take you to the place you want , enev you have not one chooses .
You can choose the way you want , like taking bus or by train .
If you want to go to this place to another place in downtown , you still not need to walk , you can take MRT .
It can take you to everywhere you want .
For example , I live in Hsingshin .
I must go to Taipen for TOEFL test .
All I need to do is taking train and MRT , I can arrive the place .

Secondly , the oil is more and more expensive .
If we have car , we must pay mush money for using oil .
The priece of oil will become more expensive in the furture .
It will cost lots of money for oil .
If we do not have car , we do not worry about those kind of problems .
That will help us save much money .
For example , many people want to buy the car which can use oil effectivily .
If we take public transport system , we can share the rise up priece of oil .
That may not cost a lot .

By those two reansons , I agree in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

5063,882476.txt,P1,JPN,medium,"Learning a wide knowlede of academic subjects is strongly important to nourish a person in univerisity .
Although there are various methods of gaining educational programs through life , the university is necessary as the place for the pre-step to work in society .
Let me explain these reasons as follows .

My primary reason is that a broad knowledge could stimulate students ' interests or help students find their interests .
When I enrolled to Tokyo University , I was thinking about majoring in civil engineering .
However , though many academic classes in first two years in the university , my interests expanded into a wider academic world .
Although I majored in civil engineering , I could solve problems according to buiding structure or environment engineering with various aspects of thoughts such as economics or chemical science , owing to a boad knowledge .

Next , various skills will be required in workplace .
Even one project of a constructing building need many knowledge and skills .
To research the site to build precisely , scientific knowledge is important .
Skill to make blue prints for it is also inevitable , in addition to the basic technique of using personal conputers .
In order to exoplain this building plan to other people and share this concept , limitted knowlede and skills are impossible to work better with others .

If a students hope to concentrate on the specialized subject , he or she could enter the graduate program .
In the graduate , students can pursue own interests more deeply and take a step to ahieve a career goal .
However , the young has great potential which an individual never find it by themselves .
Then , absorving the knowledge in the unknown world could play an important role through life .

I believe that unknown subjects of many academic subjects could expand students ' interests and ability in university .
Provided skills and knowlede in academic institutions also are required in the workplace someday .

6064,1031452.txt,P4,SPA,medium,"Nowadays we live in a very comppetitive world .
We are being overun by advertisements everyday .
We see them on tv , radio and they are even taking over the streets .
But how much of those products being advertised actually work ? .
What 's more , are they really as good as they seem to be in the advertise ? .

Sometimes you are watching TV and you see something that seems to do wonders in the kitchen , wonders on cleaning , a product that does the laundry , cleans the dog and also washes the car .
You just have to buy it .
But sometimes when you do and you try it for a few times you keep thinking : `` but this did n't happen on TV '' .
Thats because on tv they only show us what we want to see .
They dont put on air if its hard to use , or dangerous for the kid .
they put that on the box , in tiny black letters .
And it did happened to me when I bought a `` all-in wonder '' blender .

In the world of advertisement it 's all about appereances .
Most people is being suggested by those advertisements to buy the product because the people that sell it only show the good side of it .
Also to sell it they have to make it look spectacular on the eye , because nobody buys an ugly box .
All the effort is focused on making it look attractive , not where it should be : quality .
Companies are more interested in making more money by making the product more attractive to the eye , than making the product efficient , safe , and good .
Its the constant battle betweent quality vs costs , and unfortunately , these days that battle is won by costs , because it gives more money to the company that makes the product .

In conclusion , our globalized world is more interested in making a product more profitable than reliable .
We live in a `` use it and loose it '' world .
An based on personal experiences , when I hear the statement `` Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' I say to myself : sad , but true .
"
7998,1235163.txt,P4,HIN,high,"I totally agree with the statment that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
`` What you see may not be true '' some very wise person said that .
We people forget a very simple fact which company in the advertisement will show v that their product in not what you want or are expecting but will show that product is beyond your expectation and will do wonder .

Take an example of a cosmetic company in all their advertisments , we will see beautiful girls and boys who have the perfect hair , face and not to forget figures .
Why all thanks to the product of the company they are advertising .
We people get carried away so much by these beautiful faces and the magic created by the billboards and telivision , that we end up spending loads of money without thinking for one second that these people are paid models and its their job to look beautiful .

None of these advertisements anywhere will show or tell how harmful their products can be .
Also none of these advertisment will take any gurantee that what these products did for those models will do the samething for you .
Like meeting your prince charming on a subway if you wear a certain perfume .
The only thing I can smell is other persons bad breath or their underarm odour .

Most of the times as a parent it is vey difficult to explain to your younger children why a certain brand of cereal is liked by so many children on telivision and when you bring it home everybody runs away from it after first tatsing session .
Also why most of the food chains make their produts so delicious that you want to eat right there from the screen but when you order you feel like throwing out .

In my opinion companies should take responsibilty not to mislead people by showing that their products are not only of superior quality but will also achieve what they show in advertisement .
They should instead of spending thousands on publicity , should spend all that money on maintaing the quality of the products , because nothing works better than word of mouth .
publicity .

8023,1239837.txt,P1,ITA,medium,"I think it is not so simple to explain about this .
Why ?
Because I ask this question to myself different times .
I am a student .
I study civil enginnering in Milan .
During my different exams I have found some important subjects : general subjects ( for example maths ) and specific subjects ( for example road construction or structural design ) .

General subjects help you to understand the specific subjects .
But the problem is this : when I will take my degree people will see me as civil enginner .
What I can do in particular is not important .
I think that university must teaches different accademic subjects , so you can have a wide vision about a work , like a civil enginner .
After a degree , every person will improve his Knoledge in one specific subject .
In my situation , for example , a civil enginner will specialize in road construction or skyscrapers or off shore structure .
It depends what part of civil enginner he like .

and I thought If I come here and stay to study English , I can enjoy my American life .
but actueary , I think that American culture is rude .

on the other hand .
I have to understand about american culture if I continure staying here .

"
10672,1741582.txt,P7,TEL,medium,"I agree with the statement that , it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than it is them to learn facts .
For example , in science lab it is more important to understand ideas and concepts so that there after we can learn that facts to do the experiments with the concepts that we understand .

In any field , the above sentence matches .
Suppose in games like CRICKET we must first undersdtand the ideas and concepts in the game including foot work , line and length , only after understanding thoroughly the concepts of CRICKET we can learn facts i.e. we can practice .
And also in the field of Engineering , it is more important that the student understand the concept first and than to apply the concept he learned to learn facts about the experiment .

In the field of DESIGN also we have to first understand the concepts behind that design and ideas behind that design and there after we can design a particular object .
For example , take the design of a car .
First the designer will understand the specifications and concepts behind the design af the car and there after he put on the ideas how to design a new car .

so , for most of the areas it is important that we have to understand the ideas and then to learn facts .
Without learning ideas and details we cannot know the facts about the product or a system .
so , it is important for us to understand ideas and concepts to learn facts .
For example , if a new theory is proposed by a scientist , it is more important for us to understand the idea behind that principle and concept of the principle and thereafter we canable to learn facts about that principle .

All above examples will give information that it is more important to understand ideas and concepts , so by using the ideas and concepts we have learnt will help to understand to learn facts about a particular thing or an experiment .

11637,1915705.txt,P1,SPA,high,"When making reference to high school itself , it is much better to see a well-rounded transcript with Bs and As in every subject then to observe how a student had straight A+ in a certain subject , but failed in every other class .
The main point of academic subjects and school it to keep challenging yourself , never cieseing to strive for the best and never feeling satisfied with the least of what you can do .

Colleges are n't striving to recruit the A+ student that is n't committed to extra curricular activities , leadership and community service ; they 're searching for the `` well-rounded student '' .
Of course , if you can be a Honors student , athletic and president of the class at the same time , go right ahead !
But basically , everyone has to learn to do a little of everything to achieve success in life .
Being perfect at art crafts but pathetically stupid at mathematics wo n't allow you to succeed because you will need someone to do all you do n't know how to .
Once you think you 're perfect at a single subject , you must find a way to challenge yourself to improve in it as well .

Since the world has gotten so competitive over the past decades , knowing absolutely all there is to know about a single subject wo n't get you far in life because it is more important to be `` a well - rounded person '' than perfect at a single subject .
To impress someone you have to denote your overall cultural knowledge and not only your broad wisdom in history , for example .
To strive for the best , you have to know as much as possible from every academic subject .
In my experience , it has been impossible to be perfect at every subject naturally , but I find more satisfaction in constantly striving to do my best and being well-rounded in school .

An English teacher at school once told me `` it is not necessary to be , but to pretent to be '' .
When I first heard what he said I thought it was inmoral and an uneducated expectation of life .
Thinking about those words and referring to it by previuos experience though , I concluded that what he said was correct ; even though I did n't want him to be .
If you cannot find a way to be perfect in every academic subject you must pretend to be .
The way to `` pretend to be '' is to constantly rehearse on being the best , striving for the best and giving the best of your knowledge and will to that subject .
Soon , you will learn to love it , appreciate it , enjoy it and acknowledge important facts out of it .

In conclusion , is it better to have broad knowledge on many academic subjects rather than specializing in one specific subject because that 's what life it all about : knowing a bit of everything to be able to survive in this competitive world .
Every person needs to know a bit about math , sciences , arts , literature and history in order to stand out in society .
Someone whos life only reflects mathematical achievements will lack the intelligence , or knowledge , to be able to fullfill the rest of the activities in his daily life .

5285,918490.txt,P2,SPA,high,"I disagree with the statement .
I believe that older people enjoy life much more than younger people do .
There are several reasons why , first of all is that older people have more experience and can have a better idea of what they really want out of life .
On the other hand , young peple tend to be undicided on what they want .

Second , older people knowing what they want , tend to be more appreciate of life since they probably have encountered hardships to get to the point where they can enjoy life .
With young people is the opposite .
They do not have the experience nor have faced as many hardships ( if any ) in life to realize how difficult life can be .

Moreover , older people have worked very hard and have been patient enough to wait and enjoy life .
It is true that young people have more energy and probably are eager to enjoy life but older people have been waiting a long time and they can cherish and enjoy the the moment inmensely when it arrives .
I recognize that older people are more skeptical and less likely to take risks compared with a younger person so the way of life an older person might live is less intense and thrilled with emotion but and older people can enjoy their way of life as much as any young person .

Thirdly , let us not forget that older people were once young people .
They can look back and judge wether they are enjoying life more at an older age than at a younger age .
They probably would come to the conclusion that life is better at a older age just for the fact that they survived and reached an older age .

Finally , older adults certainly are , phisically , older than younger adults , but they can be young adults in spirit .
They can enjoy life inmensely knowing that they had a great life and that the best part is yet to come .

4758,829845.txt,P5,FRA,medium,"For the time being , the number of cars in the world has not stop growing .
Indeed , The technological breakthough with H.Ford and the Ford T provided the idea that each people would have a car .
But Nowadays scientits want to make people aware of the danger of cars .
So we can wonder if in twenty years ther will be fewer cars in use that there are today .

The market of cars in rich country is almost full .
In consequence , the numbers of cars will not significatively .
New cars are bought just when the former one is over .
In other way a lot of people especially in poor country do n't even seen a car or maybe so rarely .
In my opinion when those country will developt everybody would like to fulfill his dream and to buy a car as people from rich countries did .
Besides this problem , people that owns cars feel they depends on it because they take it so oftently .

But recent problems like polution make the point that the worl would have to reduce the number of cars .

The gaz exhauced by cars make the athmosphere poluted .
Those if we want to provide a available to live Earnt , we would have to change our behaviour .
Several govenement purpose bills to struggle with the widespead of air polution .
One of the major point is to put public transport much more available in big cities .
In my belief , this is a big step forward to recuce polution and also cars in cities .
If governement wants to reduce number of car in rich countries it have to make provide some waranties like developing also public transport in public area .
For poor countries , governement are experienced with problems of rich countries so I hope they will not make the same mistakes .
Before that cars become usual , they have to provide a good network of public transport not for population to see too much interest in having a personnal car .

Finally , I supports the idea that car will be fewer in the futur because , in my opinion , the problem of mass produced car is quite widespread and so governement will be smart enough to take them responsability to provide network of public transport and even to put restrictions .
However , I think that we have to focus in industry now .

4211,731320.txt,P7,JPN,medium,"It is a fact that if the students do not understand a concept and do not understand the ideas , the things surrounded by them would not make any sense and there wouldl be a confusion .
At the same time , it is also important to learn facts whihch make the things real to the students and students can easily visualize the things and can develope their own thoughts and ideas .
I had an experence related to how important it is learn the fact than understanding ideas and concepts ; therefore I disagree with the statement .
When the student can see the fact , they can accept a reality they face , develope their ideas and think deely and as the result , they will be more independent .

Before I had a situation to do a lab experminent in my chemistry class , my teacher taught us what the purpose of the experminet and explained the steps but it was not realy helpful for me to visualize what I suppose to do .
The lab was not appeal to me and I found it was boring becasue I could not use my thoughs to think deeply .
I thought It was really passive way of leaning .
Then , in my physics class , the other showed me the lab in front of the class and told us the all the facts what is happening in a real life which is realted to this experminent .
I could accept the rality of the lab really easily that time .
I was able to think beyond the physics experminent .
I also could use my imagination and so my thoughs got really deep .

Form my prsonal experience , I found it was much better to learn facts as my attitude gets more active and more independent from what the teacher teaches me a concept .
I can learn ideas and concepts from text books , so I think it is really important for the sudents to activate their minds and learn the facts .

9374,1500808.txt,P5,ZHO,medium,"People find that the traffic already become a terrible problem in those morden cities , those people who live in the cities and the countries spent a lot of time on the way between office and home .
More and more cars bring the worse and worse traffic , so people try to find out the other way , like MRT or public bus , to solve the traffic problem .

A group of people believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , because the MRT and public bus system will become more comfortable , and people will want to take MRT or bus but not driving by themselves .
We can see every morden cities , like New York , Tokyo and Taipei , spent a lot of money to build MRT system to reduce the amount of driving people .
Beside this reason , this group of people also believe that the higher price of gas will stop people to buy new cars but decide to take the public bus or MRT system .

There are still the other group of people think in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today .
Because people is getting richer and richer , and the price of a car is cheap enough to make almost every family want to have one .
They believe that the car is not only a tool for traffic , but also a important sign in their life .
When you driving , you can have fun during the process and arrive any place at anytime .
You do n't have to wait the bus or walk to the MRT stations , it means you will have more time to get together with your family .
In the other hand , the car coporation is develop the better cars that can use fewer gas or the other resource of energy , so people believe the higher and higher price of gas will not be the problem in the future .

I believe in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today .
The reasons are not only driving is so interesting that people will enjoy it forever , but also people will find out the other energy to replace gas we use today .
I believe the car is not only a tool of traffic , but also a box full of great memory with friends and family that is unvalueable .

6171,1040606.txt,P5,FRA,medium,"Today , to move , the people , in general , use theirs cars .
The numbers of cars increase always but in an other side , the prize of cars and oil increase too .
On one hand , some people think in twenty years they will use than there are today .
Indeed , having a car is more and more expensive .
On the earth , there less and less oil so the prize increase a lot and all people can not pay it .
Moreover , in the biggest cities , the common transports will be very developed like in Paris where the government make news bus ' route .
They want that Paris will becomea citie with no cars .
Indeed , some people think we need to stop use the cars because that due to the increase of polution .

One the other hand , the cars is the best to move .
Indeed , with cars you can go everywhere and when you want .
You do not wait like with bus and subways .
Maybe the prize of oil increase , however , all government try to find a solution .
For example , in France , the government want to introduce a new oil product with cereal .
This oil is ever use in some countries like Brazil where a lot cars use this oil and where the oil is less expensive than in France .
Moverover , this vegetal oil can stop the polution in the biggest cities .
And finaly , with a car , the people do what they want like at home .
They chose the radio station they want to listen , they can fume , they can phone .

According to me , the common transport can developed a lot again .

4678,815213.txt,P5,TEL,medium,"Although I understand the comfort of own car driving , i support the statement that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
There are several reasons why i feel this is right .

First , we know how many people are getting the diseases like cancer and so many respiratory diseases from the pollution delivered from the vehicles , cars especially .
In addition to causing dangerous diseases , the use of cars also spoil the greenary of environment .
Furthermore this pollution from the cars may lead to green house effect .
By considering above reasons the people may reduce the use of cars in coming twenty years .

Second , The cost of fuel for the cars is trying to kiss the sky .
Normal people are too eligible to use cars .
In addition , the natural resources like petrol and diesel are getting diminished in the earth .
This may result in avoiding of usage of cars like vehicles which consume petrol and diesel .
To increase the alternate for petrol and diesel people may have to grow natural bio plants which will replace the normal petrol and diesel .
By using natural resources we may improve the availability of sources , in contrast it may decrese the efficiency of cars .
This may result in decresing the usage of cars in the future .

Another reason i can give is that with the increasing technology scientists may invent new techniques with which people can fly with their own hands .
They may invent flying machines with which a group of people can travel at a time like as comfortable as in the car without any cost .
Morover this type of inventions will reduce the pollution problems that we have now like sound pollution and air pollution .
In addition to that it not only prevents accidents but also the life style of future citizen .

In my opinion , when technology is increasing it will definately replace a fault thing with a new thing which will be more effective than older one .
In the same way the usage of number of cars will decreas with the replacement of new technology .

11630,1914625.txt,P8,JPN,medium,"I disagree to the statement that states successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know hot wo do well for three reasons .

First , successful people prefer to train their skills and knowledge even though they already know how to do well .
Although they have good skills and knowledges , they may not try to take the new things and take risks because they know that changing their mind often can worse their ability .
By taking the new skills and risks , they can improve their knowledges and become more confident ; however , if they doing so , they may also take the risk to dwindle their ability that was aquired well because they should concentrate on only the new thing to improve .

Second , successful people want to utilize their knowlede and skills in the future .
The successful people , who have the great knowledge and interesting in the particular thing , dreaming to work in the future that requiring their ability .
Compared with the normal people , the successful peolpe have been enthusiastic about the only what they want to improve and what they intresting in while normal people have intresting in a variety of things , for example , tennis , pianno , karate , etc .

Finally , competing with others are the most important reasons that the successful people prefer to continueing to take the risk and training their skills that they already know well .
By having the rivel , successful people trying to defeat each others .
When the rivel defeat other rivel , then the other rivel try to defeat the rivel and work harder ; however , if one of them change their risk to take , then he/she will recognize it as rivel admit losing .

In the conclusion , successful people tend to do not take the new skills and risks because they have rivel , desire to utilize their skills and knowledge , and want to improve them .
In my opinion , taking the new skills or risks is not bad , however , if they really want to improve their skills , they should not try to learn any other new things ,

11414,1877217.txt,P8,ITA,medium,"I 'm completly in accord with the statement .
I think that a big part of successful it 's the capacity of to take risk and explore new frontiers .

At this time , the world change very fast , I think that if you do only wath you know without to try to emprouve yourself you can never reach success .

For example Heinstein it was yes very well prepared but also he had the capacity of risk to provide at the humanity something radical new for that time .
Just thinking about the Theory of Relativity was something extraordinary fore the 1930s and to be able to publish someting like that with the warry of to be under attack for the puplic Scientific World It 's demostrate courage .

Ther are a lot of examples in according with the statment , Steve Jobs with the Apple Computers and the I-Pod , or Bill Gates with Microsoft , they are people leaving every day with the risk .

I really admire that kind of people because I 'm really do n't know if I will be able to adopt one behavior so `` risking addict '' .
Not only in the businnes world but also in the ONG world the risk it 's a big component of the day .
For me that kind of people are really exceptionnal , I would like to be able to live like them .
I try every day to improve myself to take risk and to not be so conservative .

In this period I am under application for bisinnes school and every time that I think about the school where to apply I try to say : `` go for it ...
and try ! '' even if I know that this school it 's a `` top ten school '' and the admission it 's very hard I try to not be afraid about this and I go to take my risk .

The first one is young people spend their time in other things .
The second , they focuse their afforts in other staffes .
The last one , they do not have good supports from people to help their communities .

First of all , young people spend most of time in activeties belonging to them self not for their community .
For example , they spend time in playing , visiting friends , studying and help each others .

secondly , they focuse their afforts in things which it give the benefits for them .
For example , young people may do some works with very hard work if they get money or at least a littel gift which it unforchintly does not happen often in communities .
Thirdly , they may not have good support to that nither from school or home .
The reson is the school and home - speacily home - told them to do some things belonging to them or make benefits for them without thinking in socity .
I think young people will do some scoity activities if somebody give them a littel adviesment to participate people and help them in so many ways .
In addition , it is scoity clubs ' resbonseblity to help young people to give something to community where they live .

11798,1942513.txt,P7,ARA,high,"In my opinion , I would agree with the statement that says , `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . ''
But students have to learn both concepts and facts .
Then they have to compare between them and decide .
and sometimes facts change with the daily increase in science feilds like physics .
for example people used to think that earth is like the sphere then it was found that it is not exactly a sphere but has an oval shape .
And facts too that dinasours were just myth till they found the bones of real dinasours .

So when a student understand cocepts and ideas , he can think and used his brain and maybe discover something that can change facts .
But this still does n't mean that they should n't learn facts .
They have to learn facts but concepts and ideas are more important .

Lets say for example the laws of motion they are concepts but they were used in may discoveries after that .
why the first fact was that when you throw an apple in the air it falls back .
Therefore facts are important but concepts and ideas are needed for students and well after that scientists to discover things .

On the other sides facts are very important too .
For example the fact that if you jumped out of the window of the 7th floor , you will die .
If someone does n't know this fact in the end he is going to die just because he wants to know what will happen if he jumped but thats a far example because in our days this would never happen .
other thing is the fact that human ca n't just disappear .
But by studying concepts and ideas and doing tests .
You find that you can trick someone and you cannot be seen if you walk slowly and walk in the dark parts without making noise .

Illusion too is that you use concepts that human mind ca n't explain so you trick people by doing that .
So in the end both concepts and facts are important .
But concepts are more important .

Get well prepare to enjoy his journey is an important factor .
Choosing the destination is also what influences the most people when they are making plan for a trip , sometime we also have to choose if we need a partner or we just want to go alone .

Now the question come when it is time to go some place where we do n't know anybody , a place we are visiting for the first time , and that may require a tour guide .
A tour guide has a great benefit , it is usually a person who was born in that area , who lives there , who know the history of the place , the culture , the mentality of the society and can be a great help when we are looking place like good restaurants for cheap price .
He can give us a good recomnendation .

He also help to understand the culture , the society , the country we are visitng the history and the different dramas .
A tour guide has the benefit to be a professional .
If we plan to clamb a moutain , he can shaw us the best road , avoid some natural danger we do n't know .
We all listen the news , some countries are not that safe .
In certain areas some tourists are been keeping as hostages .
It is not something we are n't planning when we try to make a plane to travel .
In those area I think a tour guide will be well recommended .
It also help us when we want to buy some souvenir .
Usually in undevelop countries the tourist is always see as a rich person .
Local people may charge him more for a simple item .

For someone who is just going to the beach or planning to visit relative or family the tour guide is not necessary .
It depends on what we want to do and where we want to go .
Generally speaking a tour guide is a need when we are visiting big cites with history , special monument .

4641,808248.txt,P1,ITA,medium,"in my opinion would be great to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects but to be more realistic i think that is better to specialize in one or a very narrow range of specific subjects .

First of all i guess that it would be very difficult to learn about many subjects and that who wants to follow this way have to spend so many effort on it .
I totally disagree with the statement and the reason , which i mentioned previously , is because i prefer to be more realistic , in fact i think that if you are specialize in a specific subject you can improve your skill about it and you can get a job or be hired from someone more likely than if you have few notions about many things .
Another important point is that if you are spacializing in a particular thing you are supposed to be very interested in it and you can really enjoy to study it and go more in depth .
with a broad knowledge of many academic subjects you can probably just have a shallow knowledge of them instead of study them deeply .
at last i think that is pretty wrong to have a wide knowledge spread among a lot of subjects even because i think that without specialist , the world , would n't be as it is know , i guess that it would be still as it was in the past , without all the new inventions that changed history society and our way of live .
i know that probably i did n't argument my ideas in depth and i am probably too confused but that is because i was trying to disguise that i do n't agree with the statement because i do n't believe to be able to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects and i am disappointed about it .

8190,1273633.txt,P6,HIN,low,"AGREE The traveling with a group is good tour guide because whenever you go some where with the group so this is a good chance to know much more about the new places and this could be better amusement for you .
This is also the fact that you do n't need to travel in a group because somewhere you feel like to go alone and most of the peoples do n't want the company of others this is why this thought can not be applyed to every one .

Most of the peoples really want a company of some people because they do n't want to travel in group .

According to the tour guide it may be the best way because in your group most of the peoples know and they can give you the better idea that where you have to go and wher you can get a lot of fun and they can tell you where you are going wrong .

As a matter of fact it might be a good tour gide .

11224,1839454.txt,P3,ZHO,medium,"Do you agree or disagree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities ?
It is a great question to be offered because nowadays young generation ignore how to helping and contributing their communites more than the past .
I totally agree that instead of giving enough time to helping the society , they concentrate themselves more .

First of all , because of the education from the family and the society , they teach the young generation that they should think themselves first then the other things , even the things are about the country and the world .
The education tells them that no matter what happend , they should develope themselves first .
According to this kind of theory , nowadays the young generation becomes more selfish then the past one .
Due to this situation , I think that while we discuss that if the young people should pay more attention in their communities , the education of family and society should be discussed at the same time .

Secondly , nowadays no matter which country you belong , it is kind of tendency that there are fewer children in a family , for instance , mainland China , only one child in a family is normal .
Depending on this situation , the child does not know how to get along with the other people , how to care the peer and how to contribute himself for the society .
Surely , he will not focus on the need of the community and the world .
The first task he thinks is how to develope himself well .
Besides , nowadays parents always give too much pressure on young people 's grade , and I think that 's also the reason why the young generation ignore the communities and society .

To the summarize , it is kind of worse tendency that young generation does not pay attention to their communities .
In my opinion , if we hope to develope more wonderful society and world which we belongs , the first task we have to do is teaching the young generation does not be selfish any more , on the contrary , they should focus on the society and world more .

2894,501459.txt,P7,FRA,high,"Students go to the University to learn things which will make them more efficient in their job .
But is it more important for them to understand concepts than to learn facts ?

Understand a concept and/or an idea is very important in some subjects .
For example in chemistry understanding how a special reaction occurs can help researchers go further in research by inventing new molecules , find new or develop former reactions ( which were known to take place , but not knowing how it takes place ) .
Understanding an idea or a concept can make the student more efficient in his studies , researches , and in his future job .
Knowing how something occurs helps a lot in going further quicker .

Learning facts is also very usefull .
I take the same example of chemistry .
Some reactions are known but you ca n't explain how it works , so you have to learn it to go on .
Learning facts make you also more effecient , you do n't have to look every where for the answer to the problem asked .
If you want to use a known method to do each or each reaction , if you have learnt it before , you do n't have to look in the litterature everytime to do your reaction .

I think that both are very important for the students .
You need informations that are given to you by the lecturers and you have to learn and understand them .
Sometimes learning something can help you understand a point which was dark for you .
Learning things can make you also be brighter than you are already .
Sometimes you do n't have to understand something .
Learning things which can be useless to the students can be revealed later to be very important .
Learning gives you general culture .

In a sense I agree that for students it is more important to understand than to learn because once you have understood an idea you do n't have to learn it , and it make the students save some of time .
But your also have to learn .

In conclusion I would say that both learning and understanding are the keys which open the gates of the knowledge and of conciousness .

9843,1592602.txt,P2,FRA,medium,"About the statement which is `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' I agree and we are going to see four points through this topic .
In the first point , we will see the behaviour of the children , secondly the problems and stresses that does n't concern the children , thirdly the way how a child think and live and finally the fourth point is about their way to act through someone else or something .

On the fisrt hand , we are going to speak about the behaviour of the children .
Indeed if a child is in a good and normal situation , he is all the time positive and his objectives are to play , to smile , to watch cartoons , to do some paintaings and all things which concern leisure and pleasure whereas an adult has a lot of problems and things to organize all day in the life .
However the children could have some stresses and it is what it is going to be analysed in the second paragraph .

On the second hand , obviously the children confront some problems but they are really poorly compare to the problems we are going to confront during all our life , adult life as the job , the house , to organize and gain some money to live and so on .
The problems for a child is to have some friend and to be in good relationship with them and so on .
However the children could have social problems but it is felt different when you are a child or an adult .
Indeed , the child has a special way to feel the life .

Thirdly , it is true that foe the child , everything is beautiful , marvellous and good , like the believe in santa clauss and so on but when we are adult , the life is often less magic .
Their mind is pure .

Fourthly , when they act , the children do n't think how to act and to do this or that , they are not worried about confuse somebody or nothing like that .
The way to act is like they want to do it .

Finally , to conclude I think that when we are young , the life is magic and we think that when we will be older , we will ne doctor or anything and everythinh is simple to achieve .

1009,165771.txt,P1,TEL,high,"I believe that it is better to have a broad knowledge of multiple academic subjects than to be a specialist in only one .
The primary reasons for this belief are the balance a student gains from having broad knowledge and the interrelationships that exist between different subjects .

Lets start by looking at the importance of balanced knowledge .
Being good in multiple subjects such as finance and strategic management will allow a management consultant to give advice taking multiple scenarios into consideration .
On the other hand , a specialist in finance would be able to give a solution solely in terms of bottomlines resulting in a less practical solution for the customer .

The second advantage is that a company needs to hire one student competent in two fields , rather than spend more resources hiring two experts .
In addition , having two experts who do n't understand each other could result in an inferior solution because of the lack of agreement .

The final reason is the interrelationships between subjects .
For example , a physics scientist has to use complex mathematical formulas for proving some of his conclusions .
If he was specialized in physics alone , he may not be able to prove his theories unlike a scientist who is good at physics and math .

In conclusion , while a specialist may have value in certain situations , the better value proposition that a balanced student brings to the table and the multiple options he has in his career outweigh the advantage of specializing in one subject .

7108,1123878.txt,P5,DEU,medium,"I am of the opinion that it is hard to say if in twenty years will be more cars in use than today or not .
Today a lot of people - almost everyone - in Germany have a car or even more than one car .
A car symbolizes someone 's status nowadays which is pretty said .
I think that there are too many cars on the street because of the pollution and damaging the enviornment .
Why ca n't people walk or drive by bike ?
Why ca n't they even use the train ?
People get lazy .

But I presume that the tickets for a train cost too much also .
It is said that germans have no money but it is possible for them to buy a car . ? !
Where is the point ?
I think there is no point .
But I really like that trucks are not permitted to drive sundays a coulpe of hours because the noise is gone .
In twenty years peolpe are probably even lazier than they are today because everything becomes automatically and robots are going to be a normal use .
So I actually do not think that there will be fewer cars in 2026 .

On the other side it is possible that there will be fewer cars because people get poorer .
Everything becomes more expensive nowadays and people get less money .
Cars will be more expensive in a couple of years , too , and of course the gas .
The gas is one of the major problems .
It gets too expensive and people cannot effort buying it anymore .
And maybe there will be a law which says that people are not allowed to drive a car in a certain time period of the day and then people do not need a car .

As a conculsion I would like to mention that it is very hard to say wheather there will be fewer cars in 2026 or not .
People change and time changes , too .
You never really know what will happen in the future .
Everything happens for a reason .
"
476,84912.txt,P5,DEU,medium,"Scientist often make predictions about future changes in society , especially when it comes to technical innovations .
Indeed , it is imaginable that in future years , people use fewer cars than nowadays .
However , I would not fully agree with the statement .

On the one hand , it is true that the public transportion system gets better .
Especially in highly populated areas such as huge cities , the public transport becomes better integrated into the town 's scape , just think of Berlin , Hamburg , London or Paris .
There , it is more comfortable and much faster to take the bus or the underground .

Another development speaking for fewer cars are sinking travel costs .
Over the last years , it became much cheaper to travel by train or plane .
Companies like Ryanair or Vogtlandexpress , a competiting train brand , offer very good travel , even within Germany .
So that it could be a logical consequence that car transport will be used fewer .

On the other hand , do both theories work for areas of high population .
If I think my home town , the public transport system is nearly underdeveloped compared to Berlin .
Since the main part of Germany or other industrialised countries does not live in the huge cities , people will need cars to get from their home to the working place .
I think , that I will not change within the next twenty years , so that in average of the whole country , the car use will not decrease much .

3687,642008.txt,P7,ZHO,high,"Recently , many students try to find an effective and efficient way to study , but they are always confused by the dilema : Understanding ideas is the first priority or learning facts is more important ?
From my point of view , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts other than learning facts .
And this can be fully explained from three aspects : First , nowdays people have more access to those facts so they do n't have to memorize them ; Second , Understanding is more essential to help student to be more adaptable ; Third , understanding helps students to develop creativity , which is the key force in this technology world .

First of all , facts are easy to be found .
Nowadays people have a variety of ways to acquire data and information .
Books , magazines , Internet , video tapes are all the powerful resources which help students to learn facts .
For example , a student can easily get what happened in Canada in 1870 from the internet , He or she just simply type : `` What happened in Canada in 1870 '' , he or she can get thousands of ariticles and tests which are related to the topic .
Moveover , the informaiton is saftely saved and preserved from all those medias mentioned before , so what is the point to try to memorize all the terms and fact ?
It is a waste of time obviously .

Second , Understanding is more important to get ideas .
It is better to teach a man fishing skills other than just give him fishes everyday .
For example , if you just memorize `` 1 + 1 = 2 , 1 + 2 = 3 , 1 + 3 = 4 ... `` but do n't know really understand the concept of the rule of addition , next time I give you a question `` 1 + 100 = ? '' , you still do n't know how to do it .
On the other hand , if you know the rule of addition , that 's much enough .
You do n't have to memorize any facts such as `` 1 + 56 = 57 '' , you can do any addition questions .
That simple .

Last but not least , understanding helps students to be more creative .
As we know , this is a technology era , creativity seems more important than just accepting .
In order to understand , a student has to push himself thinking in a deep level , which helps to develop logical thinking and critical thinking skills .
The more a person thinks , the more knowledgable he or she tend to be .
Hence , he or she will understand more and be more creative .
This is simply because they can apply what they have learned and understanded into different situation .

In conclusion , learning facts is simple and brutal while understanding is deep and essential .
Understanding ideas can let students be more knowlegable and creative while passively accepting and memorizing facts is just a waste of time .
So it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

5680,996607.txt,P8,ARA,high,"The statement `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' is very true in my opininion .
First , if this sentence is taken and placed in a political context , many examples appear that illustrate the truthfulness of the sentence .
For example , the late president Sadat of Egypt introduced a new economic program to the country called `` infitah '' in Arabic and which means `` to be open '' in English .
This program was new to the country because it involved open trade with any country in the world , unlike the old system which was a socialist or a closed trade system .
That system had many critics at the time it was adopted but Sadat took the risk and implemented the program which turned to be a great economic success for the country .

Second , the statement is true when looking at it from a business point of view .
For example , Bill Gates , the owner of Microsoft , tried a lot of new things and invented a lot of software that turned out to be very successful although there were great risks for its failure at the begininning .
Moreover , the word `` innovation '' is used by many businesses nowadays to illustrate thier belief in new things and anything new must have great risks at first .
Major companies have entire departments directed for research and development , also called `` R & D , '' and they spend huge amounts of money to fund these departments .
Therefore , the business enviroment believes that new things lead the way for profit and thus success .

In conclusion , i totally agree with the statement because it could be applied in any context and found to be true .
Being innovative in any aspect , whether in politics , economics , or business , will deffinetly lead to success but with great risks involved .

9249,1477367.txt,P4,DEU,high,"The statement I am going to deal with is ` Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are ' .
I agree with the statement because an advertisement is meant to emphasize the positive characteristics of certain products and not to give a objective description .
There are large companies which dedicate themselves to the research of human behaviour in order to analyse how to gain the interest of a huge amount of people for a product for instance in a TV commercial .
They try to characterize people of different ages and different origins into interest groups and then figure out which interest group would be the most effective for selling the product to .
Then they come up with a commercial that directly points at this very special interest group and that 's why members of this interest group are so attracted to the advertisement and think better of the product than it actually is .

In order to emphasis my point I would like to give an example for a consumer who fell for that advertisement trap : Me .
Two years ago when I still stayed at my host parents house in Washington I went to the baseball try-outs of my highschool because I never played baseball before .
My host dad gave me one of his old baseball glove ( must have been about 40 years old ) and so I tried out .
I had been a pretty good pitcher back in Germany so I thought it would be much of a problem to join the team ( at least the reserve team ) .
Instead of showing my pitching skills the coach wanted me to catch a couple of balls with my glove .
I tried to do so but I could n't really figure out how to use the old glove so the ball would actually stick in there .
After the try-outs the coach told me to come back when I was was abel to catch properly with my glove .
That day I saw a brand-new glove at a sport goods store .
It was all black and had a faked autograph of saome major legue baseball player I never even heard of on it .
The commercial sign right next to it said `` You gon ' catch every ball ! ''
.
My host dad told me it was overpriced but for about the next couple of days I went to that store and looked at that glove .
After a couple days I finally decided on buying that glove .
The next day I went out to the field with my host dad to play catch .
I proudly told him that I was going to catch any ball .
Actually I could n't catch anything .
I 'm just a bad catcher , that 's what the 60 dollars I paid for the glove made me realize and showed , that most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are .

10336,1683847.txt,P1,TEL,high,"Education is something which increases the self-esteem and improves knowledge of the one who tries to pursue that .
It also increases stature , which is of primary concern in today 's society .
Given the two options , it would not be a good idea to deal these two options in the same way .
So , I would like to view this topic in two different ways :

1. Undergraduate level
2. Graduate level

First , during undergraduate studies , a student has to learn a wide variety of subjects because it is the high time for him to learn the basics .
If he does not study many subjects , there wont be a difference between him and uneducated person .
After all , everybody expects him to be familiar with all the related subjects present in a stream .

For example , a Mechanical Engineer is assumed to have knowledge about thermal , production , design , material sciences and many more subjects related to his mechanical stream .
Because all these depend upon one another , it becomes absolute necessity to learn the fundamentals of all these in order to excel in mechanical field .
And the same is true about all the remaining streams too .
There is one more disadvantage , If he studies only one subject at this part of his life , he would probably find it boring and insipid as time passes , and would definitely end up becoming nothing in his life .

Secondly , during graduate level , it would be a better option to select any one of the subjects he is familiar with , and deal with that particular subject in detail .
Then , he will gain in-depth knowledge about a subject and that can help him in achieving a good job in his respective domain .
Later on , even if he finds the domain boring , he can drift towards different subject because he has the fundamental knowledge of many subjects .

keeping these two choices in view , I would suggest to gain basic fundamentals in your undergraduate level and then go on search for a topic which fascinates you and then pursue in-depth knowledge of that particular subject in your graduate and doctoral level .
In this way , you can become a jack of all trades , and , indeed a master of few too .

6359,1055473.txt,P2,HIN,medium,"The very word enjoyment can be inferred differently by diffrent people .
Each and very person has his own perspective about life and thus on things enjoyable .
But , considering young and old as two groups of people .
Rather than group of unique individuals we can mention generally and not with convection who enjoys more .

when people are young they have a lot of vigor and curiosity for life alltogether .
This can be reflected in there activities as compared to the old .
If you take for example , a teenager is more likely to have a funfilled action packed day than an older person .
If a person does more stuff in a day , say work for that matter and he likes it he is enjoying .

Also , when you are young you have lot to do .
A young person has not lived as much as half of the elderly .
A young person has lot to enjoy .
But , the elderly have gone through the whole thing and dont find it interesting or are altogether out of place for enjoying the stuff .

The most important factor is that the elderly are not healthy and this imposes a few restrictions .
I dont think an old guy would love to go trekking with his grandson .
Even if he loves to , he possible cannot do it practically .
So , this indirectly restricts the options available with them and thus restricts there enjoyment sources .

The problem mentioned above also affects the elderly pshchologically .
They develope a certain pessimistic attitude .
Even if they can , you wont find them getting indulged into activities .
Lets consider that they do participate .
But , this too will be on a self concious basis and they wont be able to let go completely .

So considering all the above factors and even though you consider a few exceptions .
It is very clear that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
As , even though older people may have the intent to but the are not capable , because of the above mentioned reasons .

5943,1021281.txt,P2,ZHO,medium,"Nowadays , there is a hot topic about whether young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Some people think that old people have more time to enjoy the life .
Others may disagree and contend that young people are more energetic and more likely to enjoy the life .
If I were faced this issue , I will definitely support the latter point .
there are numerous reasons to support this point and I would only explore some of them and describe as follows : The first and foremost reson to support my point is just as someone said , young people are more energetic than older people .
This is essily seen in the entertainment fields .
For example , young people are more concering on the entertainment events like movie , music , entertaining stars .
They will spend lots of their leisure time talking and watching them .
Their physical conditions also allow them to do so for a long time .
You seldom see the old people in a disco bar .
In a word , since young people have more power , they are more likely to enjoy the life .

The sencond and significant reason for my view is that young people are more creative than older people .
It is obvious in teenagers .
A scientific research show that since young people 's brain in the formative period , they conuld accept new things easily .
For instance , the Internet is widely used in the recent decades .
The user of them are mostly young people .
No wonder someone represent young people as the rising sun at about eight or nine o'clock .
their creativity enable them to enjoy the life most .

In conclusion , it is not hard to find that young people can enjoy life most than any other age people because of their energy and creativity .
But we also encourage the older people learn from the young and never give up the life .

1649,279246.txt,P7,ITA,high,"Is it important for students to understand ideas and concepts ?
of course it is we cannot deny that studying a subject and learning this subject does not necessary imply that you undestood the whole idea and the whole concept .
Sometimes might be better to understand the whole sense of a lecture at your first read for example instead of reading it more and more times to learn every single word of it and being able to repeat it in front of the professors during an oral examination !
I would rather look like a computer machine repeating binary codes without understanding why and what it is really doing !
I think that to better comprehend this idea , comptures might be the perfect example .
The whole concept is that scientist built the machines to help people perform their jobs easily simplifing complex procedures using software based products .
The machine is able to perform all this complex operations in a very short time because somebody programmed it to reapeat a matrix of data and multiplexing it in different ways , the machine is able to reproduce always the same actions but is definitively not able to understand why is performing this action , is not able to learn from his errors , is not able to modify automatically his behaviour .
That 's mainly why I think any sort of attempt to learn facts for what they actually are whitout understanding what is the whole idea or concept behind them is totally unuseful for the student .

Once again if the student does n't understand the concept he might not be able to modify his beahviour has the example of the computer machine , because without understanding behaviour modification will not occur .
You can learn from you errors and mistakes , a teacher can correct you if you are doing something wrong , people can learn from their own mistakes , but if they keep on replicating what everyonelse is doing and repeat what the manager or the boss says they will always be stucked in their original , let 's say `` behaviour '' no behaviour modification will occur , thus preventing them to emerge and to become powerful or to express and sell their own ideas .

11033,1807724.txt,P7,ZHO,high,"I most certainly agree with this statement .
As a music teacher myself , of course I want my students to learn their facts , but it is more important for them to understand it .
I believe that a student should be able to understand what they just learned because that is why we learn in school .
We go to school to learn and understand the materials to apply it to our lives .
If a student did not understand something , then they are not going to be able to use it in life .

The best way of knowing what they have been taught is asking them to use it .
If they can not use what they had learned , then that means they do not understand that certain topic .
It is absolutely pointless for a student to go to class and just memorize facts .
To understand something means you can use it , teach it to someone , and be able to go further than just '' memorizing '' the facts .
To me , in order for any student to excell is for them to be able to use what they know .

I am not saying that learning facts are not important for a student , but sometimes there is no point in teaching that topic to the student if it means they do n't know what just happened .
A student can walk in a class and ` learn the facts ' , but that student will come back out with only facts .

For example , there is a math student who just learned all the numbers of a problem .
Sure , he knows all the numbers , but how in the world the numbers got to where they are is a completely different matter for the student .
That is why teachers today take time to pull things apart and explain them in details .
This situation can happen in any class .
Poetry can be read and the students can read it and learn the vocabulary to only read a poem .
Although to go through the details of the poem would be much more effective in a student 's literature skills .

I do not agree that facts is all we should learn about in life .
There is much more to learning than just facts and statistics .
Being able to truly understand what was taught is the same as saying , `` okay , I know how to use it now and it definitely makes more sense than just memorizing notes . ''

480,86771.txt,P4,KOR,medium,"I think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

First , the motive for producers to make their products seem better than they really are is that producers want to convince consumers to buy their products .
Today 's competition among companies in business world is like wartime .
For a company to survive and make profits a company needs to sell as many products as possible and raise revenues .

Second , a company can make products seem better than they really are because consumers do not have enough information about products .
Even though companies makes false comments about products consumers cannot tell comments are true or false .
Some consumers may be too busy to look for information to judge whether comments are made correctly or not .
Also , the fact that the functions of the products in market are not very different plays a role in making false advertisements .
Since the functions of the products in market are so similar to each other consumers will be easily convinced to buy products if consumers hear comments by producers that point only to strong points of products and exaggerate the features of the products .

Third , people are more easily convinced by visual images than other types .
If a product looks better than other products , a consumer might want to buy that product even without obtaining information regarding fuctions .

In conclusion , producers make products seem much better than they really are through advertisements because producers want to survive in competitions and consumers do not have proper information and are more susceptible to visual images .

Not only in practicals but also in theory of various subjects like mathematics we require the basic concepts and ideas as without knowing the concept of right formula in right situation we never get an appropriate result .

when we take an example of a medical student if he does n't know about the basic anatomical terms like superior , inferior , posterior , anterior , dorsal , ventral , superficicial , deeper , distal , proximal , phrenology , cardiology , heamatology , dermatology , like basic concepts are basics for understanding the physiology and also the pathological conditions of a particular part or organ .

Coming to the pharmacy without having the basic knoledge about formulation we never develope a new formula where we need the concept of ingredients present in the formulation .
In physics we never understand the how to solve a problem in force or work or power chaper until we have a basic knowledge of the concept of newton 's law of motion .

I like to point out leaders , because I personally admire one who left everything behind , family , homecountry , friends , mony-savings , etc. for his dream of success , and took a nation up to its highest point ; in every matter , such as , economically and more .

I believe it is always good to take a risk , even if you fall while trying , there has to be something good learned out of it .
It is when we risk that we understand that a fall is juts a steping-stone in our way of success .
And you learn to stand up againg and never give up , and keep on your way .

If you just stick to what you know , no matter how good you are at it , you are going to get stock in a simply way of life and never progres up rather than to risk a bit and get more instead .

A good risker always make sure to get the most out of a fall .
Feeling confident of yourself at all time is also helpful when taking a risk , keeping in mind `` I can do it '' would help you get what you want easily .
You also know what are you best at , so just take a little risk and improve your knowledge way farther .
A risk does n't have to be consider as a problem or something bad , it could also be a chance , an oportunity to prove yourself that you are up to higher challenges and that you can acomplish what you want ; that there is not limits for someone

10404,1696815.txt,P7,HIN,high,"Different people can have different opinion about this topic .
some will go for understanding the ideas by keeing their point of view as - learning can be made easier by understanding the ideas .
But some consider learning facts are more important then understanding the ideas .

Considering from my point of view - I totally concede with the statement `` it is more important for student to understand the ideas and concepts then it is for them to learn the facts '' .

I endorse my view by saying that `` learnig in depth can result in more innovations '' .
It is very important for a student to understand the basic fundamental of the problem .
suppose if a student is solving the problem related to mathmatics and he is doing calculus , then it would be quite difficult for the student to solve the problem by just remembering the facts there , instead if he knows the basic formulas and method use those formulas according to the question it would be easier to solve the problem .

In the second place `` to be practical '' it is necessary to have full fleged knowledge about the subject and the concepts behind that. , And scientist have proved that .
They may not be able to find new innovations by just learnig facts .
If we will run only after facts and learn them how we will be able to grow our mind To create mental agility , to explore ourselves , to think beyond other 's point of view , it is very important to have greater and deep knowledge of the concepts .
By knowing the ideas afer the situtation it becomes easier to have a command over that .

So i would say that students should learn the fundamentals behiend every problem , because it will help in creating their mind , power of thinking , abilty to take quick decision , flexiblity to adapt to different situtations , because the are the backbone of the nation and in their hand lies the fate of the nation

Even though most young people do not give any time to helping their communities some other do .

It is clear to me that most young people do not give any time to helping other .
How many of them have ever spend five minutes really listening to a homeless explaining why he reached that situation and what is the money he is asking for ?
In everyday life , we all are very busy and we do not pay any attention to people around us but if we did , we sould see people in need at every street corner .
Last year on the way to my college there was a homeless sitting always in front of the same cigarett shop .
I used to just walk sometimes stop at the shop but i never had noticed him .
One day that I missed the bus , I was looking for a light and I just realized this man was there smoking a cigarett and thats how I started to talk to him .
He explained me what has happened to him and I then felt so concerned that I gave him some money and a few cigaretts .

All tough some young people do not give any time to helping others , Some young people do .
Some of them find ways of helping even if they do n't have money , for example by talking to old people feeling lonely .
Some of them even create association and try to collect funds from wealthy adults and give it to communities such as homeless people .
For instance , there is one association that visist people in my building twice a year .
They usually are students who knocks the doors and ask if they can come in to explain the problem of the community they are helping .
Unfortunately , They knocked twice at my door at the wrong time because I did not have money .

Advertisements only give the adventages and best sides of the product , you ca n't show any attention about it 's disadvantages .
Consumers must also learned bad sides of the product .
Furthermore advertisement can tall much more than they are .

In addition to this if you make lots of advertisement about the products poeple want to learn what it is than less advertising products .
Of course they will go to the shopping centr and look your products and usually this looking will finished with buying the product .

In our country there are also lots of advertisement which make person boring in a rest of tv program .
Sometimes it takes twenty minutes .
In fact as me all people change the channel to fin new one which is not advertise something .
If advertiser want to take peole on tv they must do funny and interesting advertise .

Beside of that most advertisement may include more lie than others .
This is selling method and we ca n't know if they tell us true or not .
We must search and ask alot about products before buying it .
We can get this informations who use that product before .
And also politicians have to do some laws for advertisement .
That laws mus limit the advertisement and include some punishment if they tell wrong in the advertisement .

5487,961600.txt,P1,FRA,high,"Through an academic training , you usually get broad knowledge of various topic .
But you can also decide to specialize on a subject that you may be keen on studying .
To my mind , i think it 's better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to have a specialization .
You can have an overview of many topics and have a generalist training .
Also , you do n't get bored by such a diversity of subjects .

Firstly , having broad knowledge gives the opportunity to learn things about an unkown subject .
For example , i studied for one year in Grenoble Ecole de Management .
This first year was very generalist and i could learn the basic principles of many subjects .
I studied accounting , finances , marketing .
I reckon that a futur manager must have a knowledge on each of these subjects and master them .
It ' a condition if he wants to succeed .
Thus , i believe having broad knowledge is an opportunity to learn more things .
Above all this diversified knowledge will be useful in the future life .

Secondly , i think that if you study only one specific subject , you can get bored and became fed up with it .
Indeed , having a specialization means studying the same subject for long hours in the same day or week .
Even if it can be a subject you find really attractive and interesting , the fact to focus on it can have negative effects .
The interest can decrease so as the attention paid to the subject .
After long hours spended on the same issue , you enjoy tackling another subject and consequently another interest arises .

Thus , in my opinion i think having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more beneficial .
It allows to have a generalist training and to get the basic principles on subjects , useful for daily life .
Moreover , with such a diversity you are more involved in each subjects and do n't get bored with the training .

some people prefer to spend that time in a group with a tour guide and other prefer to stay alone .
i will definitely say that i disagree because , by myself i can visit whatever i want , i will never get bored by the discussion and i can rest whenever i want .

first of all , the worse thing when you 're in vacation is to be obliged to do exactly what the majority wants to do .
Because you are in a group of different people you can do what you want to do , of course .
you have to go where everybody is going , eat where every body eat .
Instead of that , when you are by yourself you can decide exactly what you want to visit without being contrary .
For example i was in Italy for vacation with a group of people .
I really wanted to visit a very famous museum , but i could n't because it was n't on the program of the day .

secondly what is n't benefict for my vacation , is to get bored by the discussion .
When you in the group , at certain time the guide tour have to talk about the history of the city , the people ...
most of the time those subjects are n't interesting .
i ca n't imagine myself in vacation laying on the beach while the guide tour is talking about origin of the beach in the world or something else .

Finally , the most important thing while you 're in vacation or when you travelling is to be able to rest when you want to .
One day i was in germany with some friend of mine and a tour guide .
Every morning at seven o'clock he was supposed to wake up everybody for the break fast time .
That made me so mad because i could n't rest at all .
Contrary , when you are by yourself , you do n't have to worry about the time or rushing anywhere .
So you can have more time to rest base on the fact that you are your own guide .

11602,1907882.txt,P2,KOR,high,"Many people argue that younger people enjoy life more than older people do .
From staying up late and doing activities to playing extreme sports , many argue that younger people has the youth to do more things that older people cannot do .
Although it is commonly accepted that younger people are less fatigues than older people when participating in any activity , it does not mean that younger people enjoy their life more than older people .
I believe that the statment , `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' is false .

Being younger does not necessarily mean that they know how to enjoy their time well .
Younger people are usually enrolled into schools and universities , which gives them less if not no time to enjoy their life .
Also when they get older , they must find a job , and work their way up to higher position , where they would have more free time .
Only then would a person be able to enjoy life by doing activities that he/she enjoys .
Since it tends to take time for a certain individual to be in a higher position in one 's own company , people gets to enjoy their life after they get older .

Also Younger people face many disadvantages that older people does not .
Younger people may not have as much freedom as older people do , such as being denied to enter a bar .
Also an older individual usually has more money to spend for leisure time , while younger person might not have as much money to spend anything on .
Being younger does not only bring advantages , which offsets the disadvantages of physical limits that older people often face .

Although many argue that a younger individual has more capabilities , time , and youth to do activities than older people do , I believe that statement to be false .
Each individual 's physical limits are defined by one 's will power and one 's own physical capabilities , and since this is the case , the situation varies among each individuals .
Also since being older can bring positive advantages , I believe that younger people does not necessarily enjoy life more than older people do .

Another example , When a person knew everything in a conversation , he must be admired by any other people , It makes him have more atractive .

For example of my opinion : when we learnd the students about some thing such as learning or education it is very important thing and everyone should learn , when we told them these words just without make them like it do you know what this means ?

691,113518.txt,P3,TEL,high,"Helping a community is a noble act .
And I also agree that youngsters today do not give enough time to help their own community .
But it can not be completely attributed as lack of concern from the young people .
There are several reasons for this .

The primary reason is that with so many activites going on parallelly in young people 's lives - studies , projects , assignments and other more important commitments that they are left with very little time for themselevs .
And so they prefer to concentrate that little time left in their hobbies or some other personal activities rather than helping their communities .

With the advent of television and other media 's which has revultionised our lives , we are concerned so much more with what is happening around the world that we actually forget the problems immediately surrounding us .
One of my neighbour 's is addicted to this one sitcom , which is played everyday night that he actually leaves all his pending work and religiously watches the show .
Such is the impact of television on today 's generation .

Also there is a growing trend among youngsters especially among the college goer 's that such activities are uncool and out of vogue .
So some students deliberately avoid helping a community even if it is against their conscience , just to show that they are cool .
To be frank , i myself have witnessed this during my junior college years .

This kind of thinking which is actually much more prevalent among the youngsters in the urban area 's needs radical change .
It is really a shame that youngsters today consider such noble acts as cheap and uncool .

But there are some people in each community who after all this things , dedicate some time to such work .

6838,1099116.txt,P1,HIN,high,"I totally agree with the given statement beacause i 've taken broad knowledge from my school till college .
I think it is very important to have knowleged about the things around you .
Studing or specializing on just one subject is not enough in today 's world .
For an example , to become a doctor a student must not only take science classes like bio , chemistry , physics and math , but they also have to take some elective classes aswell ( politics , economis , humanities ) , in order to understand how things work around them .

I 'm an engineering major studnet i 've completed most of my science classes , but i 've also taken classes like history , art , socialogy , which helped me to understand the importance of the other subjects .
These classes developed the understanding of other topics like politics , history , socialogy and world religion in me .
I was very suprise to know how important these other subjects are in order to understand the nature of our society .
After taking all these classes my way of looking/thinking about the people around me or in other words the society that we are living in have changed a lot in a positive way .

Someone who does't get a chance to learn about the other subjects find hard time to get a job , because his knowlege is just on specific subjects .
In modern world companies are looking for people who have knowledge of all sorts of field , rather than having knowleged on just one field .
For example there is more chances for a computer programmer who also has some kind of background in the field of electronics than the other programmer who just knows about his own programming field .

In my opinion it is really very important for all of us to have a knowledge of all aspects of life .
If you go to universities it very common for a student to have double a major that means to have degree in two field .
Becasue they know what companies are looking for once they graduate .
Thats a kind of having another tool when other doens't work .

I do not believe that there will be an invention which is able to replace the car .
In the last couple of decades the car has assumed an important role in every-day life .
It is too much included in our life routine as to lose significance in as little time as twenty years .
However , the machine that will be called `` car '' at that time will be very different from the car we know today .

Technological development will have to face the problem of rapidly declining natural ressources very soon .
As cars use up the fuel given to us by nature , the developers need to find alternative energy sources that are able to replace gas .
Methods like using electricity or solar energy which have already been invented have to be made more practical in order to convince people of the advantages of changing to new technologies .

The lack of indefinite natural ressources combined with a slow development of new technologies will decrease the number of cars in use .

First , it is fame .
Maybe one company 's product is good , but if there is just few people know it .
The product will fail , because it is not famous .
Of course , the product will not sell well .
Instead , if today this product is pretty famous , it is easier to sell .

I would say that understanding the ideas and concepts is more important for students than to learn facts .
In maths , understanding the ideas and concepts is the only way of passing a test successfully , because there are only a few facts that could be learned .
You have to now how to add 2 to 2 in order to get the right solution .
Because only knowing the solution to be 4 does not help you with adding 145 to 589 .

Another example is an interpretation of a text .
The student has to know how to do the task .
He has to analyse the text concerning rhetorical devices and theories of communication in order to get a good mark .
The knowledge of an metaphora in a special line does not help him to compare it to the epoch or characteristics of the protagonist .

In general , facts concern a special problem or situation , like in history .
One example for a fact is the existing of a monarchy in Germanz until the 20th century .
But the concept of a former German monarchy is similar to a former French one .
Only when you know what ideas and concepts are about you are able to compare them to another similar situation or use them on another subject .
And usually the knowledge of development and their reason are more important than the dates alone .

When scientists are searching for a problem , they compare the aspects they know to the facts they discover , but to understand how a process works , thez need ideas and concepts .

Despite the fact that students must learn concepts and ideas to succeed in tests , they should not neglect facts , as well .
Every thesis needs a backround of facts , which prove that the ideas ans concepts are correct and useful .
To summerize the idea I have to state that the understanding of the ideas and facts is more important than the knowledge of facts .
But any idea would exist without facts , so the second question in a test will be about specific examples .

5703,999780.txt,P8,JPN,medium,"Many people are trying to succeed in their career .
Some of them fails , but others can reach the goal .
those people who became successful , used to work very hard but to be very well skilled .
When a person succeeds , then they are more likely to chalenge themselves .
Because they feel more satisfaction , they feel like they need to try themselves in higher position and in a risky situation .

When somebody has already succeeded on their normal life , they become proud of themselves .
They feel happy and tend to have more self-confidence .
That motivates the person to try something new and more successful things .
They also could do everything what they would like to do if they have succeeded the most difficult in their life .

Then , that person , because he/she believes that everything will be fine , starts preparing to do new things .
Even when something goes wrong , they believe that it could be solved quickly with their own experience and knowledge .
Those backgrounds before being a successful people is another strengh to keep them trying on a new things .

Another reason for people who takes risk is because they want the profe of being so well .
Being such charismatic person is to say like being a hero .
They want to realize and show other people that they are really a great person who does n't feel satisfied of what they already achieved .
They want to see how much they can do further .

All in words , successful people want to try new things for their own pleasure .
They need to continue challenging something to be sure that they can go higher more than they are now .
That desire of going upper is what makes the person chalenge in whatever thing they whant to achieve .
That 's why the ones who reached the goal keep trying themselves to continue being better .

5315,925939.txt,P8,FRA,medium,"Can we say that success and creation are linked ?
The main point is to make a difference between financial success and personal success .

Through a finanacial point of view .
New things are not always successful .
Indeed , success as well as failure are parts of the risk .
For instance , when you gamble in a casino , you can win but you also can win .
Maybe the first thing is to analyze what is to be successful .

A successful person can also be the one who tries what he really wanted to try , the one who is not afraid of realizing his dreams .
The issue of the try does n't influence the value of the act .
Which is taken into account is the will to realize his projects and achieve his deams .
Therefore , we can say that people who acts and reacts are successful poeple .

They attract admiration and respect from the others .
Indeed , taking risks and trying new things are a proof of courage .
Trying new things can turn a person into a leader .
Even if the try ends up to be a failure , because it is new , it is always a start for something else new .

In Arts , Surrealism , after the Second Wold War was rejected in favor of Existentialism .
The Surrealists did n't change the world as they wanted to do it .
Nevertheless , they opened new possibilities of creation and they appeared as a new source of inspiration .
They forced admiration because they were not afraid of chocking people and making fun of sensitive values like death and war .

it has been seen when we are travelling in group we get lot of monoterly benefits .
Buy tickets in group , u get special discounts , staying in hotel enjoy discount , while ur travelling in group , if any one in the group becomes sick , their are so many people to take care of , which is very importan while you are travelling .

5925,1019537.txt,P5,KOR,high,"Transportation has been one of the most important factor in human civilization .
According to the history book , Roman empire became so powerful and managed to rule a large land because they created road .
Later , European countries could create many colonies because they rule the world 's ocean with great ships .
Now , in this modern era car is the most important transportation .
We still use ships and airplains which are far more advanced than vehicles , but they cannot be owned easily by many people because of high prices .
For now , car is the main transportation system in the world .
Will there be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years ?
For now , it is not possible because there is no reason for us to change our current transportation .
Only problem with current transportation system is `` fuel '' .
It needs gas , but gas is limited .
But last decade , researchers have developed new types of fuels for car such as sun light , water , and electricity , and these new inventions are starting to replace old cars that run with gas , and we do not use as much gas as we used to compard to the past .

There is no way that number of cars will be decreased in twenty years .
Only way to decrease the number of cars that are owned by people , is an involvement of government .
First , government can increase tax .
In many nations , one family owns more than one car based on statistics .
By increasing tax rate , families wo n't be able to keep as many cars as today .
Second , if government supports the local transportation companies financially or perhaps creates government owned transportation companies , it might lower the numbers of cars that are owned by individuals by giving them more choice of transportation .
Many nations around the world have a great transporation system , but there are still some countries that do not have enough finance power to s From my perspective , there wo n't be fewer cars in use than today unless the government get involved with transporation system in the societyy .

306,54915.txt,P6,JPN,medium,"Basically I do not agree with this statement .
Actually , travels with a tour guide are confortable .
The reason comprises the following two facts .
First , most of tour guides usually know and provide a lot of useful information , such as good places for visiting and viewing , delicious restaurants and dengeours areas .
The other reason is that we do not have to care any problems related to speaking foreign languages e.g. reserving hotels , buying tickets or ordering in restaulants .

However , guide tours have a serious problem , at least for me : we cannot arrange the schedule as we like .
Tour courses are strictly determined .
This implies that we cannot take a rest even if we feel very tired , and we have to go to places where we do not want to go .
We cannot get up late ...

Another reason why I do not agree with the statement is that we are not able to have private time due to the group travel .
Private time is quite a precious for eny situations , especially for travels .
We must always go with the group and the tour guide .

On the other hand for the private travels , we can go anywhere we want to go , we can have a tea for a rest , we can stay for a long time as we like .
If we want to know some useful information , travel information centers will be helpful .
We may apply half-day or one-day tours found in the information center .

In summary , I prefer private travels .
If I need some useful information or some optional tours , I will go to travel information center .

9312,1489224.txt,P8,ITA,medium,"I agree when it is said that successful people try new things and take risks to reach theire purpose .
But I think that this is just one side of success .
In fact nobody could ever have success if he is not lucky too , neither `` successful people '' .
Obviously if you always stay attached to things that you already know , maybe you could live a normal life , but surely you will never have success and this is why I agree with part of the statement above .
Successful people always try to reach new goals and try to be involved in different situation .
This is a risk , because they leave something known for something But as I previously said , you have to be lucky .
Even in literature there is a good example of what I am saying .
If we analize the `` Malavoglia '' , book written by G. Verga , we could find exactly the explanation of my thought .
When ` Ntoni , one of the main character of the story , took the family 's boat `` La Provvidenza '' and sail to a new harbor looking for success , the fortune were not with him .
In fact he lost everything during a storm , broke the boat and that had been the beginning of a lot of problems for his family .
Maybe this could be too much strong as example , but I think that it give the idea of what I think about the statement to argue .
So , I certainly agree with the statement , but if I could , I would complete it saying that successful people are even lucky people .

673,112115.txt,P5,HIN,high,"I completely agree with the fact that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
To support my stand there are three valid points .
Firstly , with the advancing technologies newer and faster modes of transportation are coming up like metros , bullet train , intra city express which makes it very convinient for people to travel from one place to another and actually consumes less amount of time as compared to cars which generally takes more time because of the traffic jams and all .
People rather commute to far off places in metros and trains and have already started using their cars as mode of transporatation to nearest station if they have such an option .

Secondly , with the arrival of Internet and Video Telecommunication most of the offices find it convinient for its staff to work from their home , eg. Software firms , Business offices and Corporations related with trading of Shares etc .
With this trend on , it will take very few years when most of the people will be working from their homes .
This will automatically reduce the usage of cars as most of the people use their cars to go to their respective offices .

Finally the most important factor which will determine the reduction in the usage of the car is the scarcity of the fuel .
In todays world the consumption of fuel is growing exponentially and it seems there are no means to replenish it , even though various efforts are being made world wide .
With limited amount of fuel supply the world wont be able to sustain the demands of the market and finally , to come up with the solution so as to reduce the fuel consumption , people will be motivated not to use cars and other such vehicles .
This will automatically determine less usage of cars in the future years .

It might be hard to digest but the way things are turning out to be it seems we will soon stop the usage of one of the most important inventions of human history .
And it can be very well assumed that this time duration will be not more than twenty yeras .

3660,637749.txt,P4,ARA,high,"Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
This is extremely true in our modern day because the competition in the market is so high that businesses are willing to do anything to sell their products .

I agree with this statement because I personally have bought many things based on their advertisements but was shocked later on by what I bought .
This is a successful way to make the consumer loose trust in the producing company because when cheat and deceit come into the issue there is no way a person can depend on the seller .
The market is full of other options so the buyer is not limited to this specific place especially after being treated unrespectfully .

I , personally , have an issue with trust and when I put my trust into something I expect to get what I ask for with honesty and purity .
As soon as I realize that I have been tricked then that is the last time I buy anything from that place .
I do not think that I am the only one that thinks this way because if someone is willing to put their money into something than this thing better be worth it .
Whenever money is involved the topic becomes more sensitive because money is something that people work hard to try to earn and they will never just blow it away on something useless , unless they have a lot of it , then thats a different story .

On the other side , though , the purpose of advertising anything is to make it more appealing to the people and by giving it a little `` push '' of superiority makes it attract more people .
So you ca n't really take it against them because that is their goal .
Although there is a difference between tricking someone into something and convincing them that this is the best product .
If a person is deceived into buying something than he is n't very happy especially if this thing was not really worth its price .
But if a person has satisfaction from what he bought because he was convinced and appealed by it then he will not realize any defaults in the product because of his over joy with it .

This issue can be argued in two different perspectives and I do n't nessecarily think that any of these two points are wrong because they are both legitimate .
My stand on this issue is that I do n't mind being convinced into something but I would never tolerate being tricked into it .
Faking something and misleading someone is the worst thing to me and I seriously would NEVER put up with it .

When I heard the story of my aunt , I was amazed .
My aunt who really likes dancing was a trouble maker in the school when she was a teenager .
She only thinks about dance , but not school working .
She was failing in almost every subjects .
Her parents and teachers were very worried about her .
She could not even adapt to school life because everybody thought she is very stupid .
Nevertheless she did not care what others think .
She just keep practicing dancing and singing .

Nobody never thinks that she would become such a popular person .
10 years later , everybody was surprised and amazed at her .
The reason everybody was surprised , she became a actress who is acting on musical stages .
Everybody wants to see her acting .
Her dancing and singing make people fascinating and happy .
Her picture and interviews were on Newspapers , magazines and TV shows .
Now nobody thinks that she is `` stupid . ''

7395,1150202.txt,P2,FRA,high,"Comparing young people to older ones , people tend to think that the youth enjoys life more than its elder counterpart .
Indeed , it is easy to realize that in most of the cases , old people are less able-bodied than the young ones .
This physical aspect may interfere with one 's ability to enjoy life because it prevents people from doing a certain number of activities such as sport or even the basic everyday act of going outside to do shopping for example .

Moreover , most of the activities in cities are created for the young people , to avoid them getting bored and staying in the streets .
These activities can be as well night clubs than sport centers ...

Nevertheless it would not be fair to attribute an enjoyable life to the young people only .
Indeed , I really think that enjoying life simply depends on one 's state of mind .
For instance , if we are used to get bored of everything and to criticize more than to admire then we will scarcely enjoy life .
On the other hand if we are used to be positive on the events happening then we have less reasons to dislike life and not to enjoy it .
Thus in my opinion enjoying life is more related to a psychological aspect than a physical one and in that way it is possible for the old people to enjoy life as much , indeed more , than the youth .

The fact of enjoying life can also be influenced by the events happening or that already happened in one 's life .
In that way , as I said before , the eldest person may enjoy life more than the youngest one because if for instance a young has health problems or family ones while the old no , then the latter will be more likely to enjoy life than the former one .

As a conclusion I would say that enjoying life is not a matter of age but a matter of state of mind and way of thinking .

There are two reasons for my choice .
Firstly , young people are more healthy than older people .
Secondly , young people want to learn many different things especially enjoyable things .

Young people are more healthy than older people .
Health is important for doing enjoyable things .
If you are not healthy you can not work , go to school , watch TV .
Shortly you can do nothing that you have to and of course you can not enjoy .
When you go to a pub , you dance and sometimes you drink .
When you dance you really get tired .
Dance needs energy and energy is in the youth .
Also most of the old people have to use drugs and that ' s why they can not drink alchol .
Another reason , the old people have to sleep long hours to feel well but the young people do not .

Young people want to have experiments about everything enjoyable .
Old people lived many thing and they do not want to learn something new .
They do just that they have to such as sleeping , working , eating .
The old people want to relax .
Young people climb mountains to experince the feeling of affair because the feeling of affair is new for them .
But an old man does not choose to climb a mountain .
He can choose to sit in front of a sea and drink coffee .

2891,500948.txt,P3,KOR,medium,"Young people do not give enough time to helping their communites and that is one of the main social issues for nowadays .
It was not issued in the past , however as the industry is keep growing and becoming more wealthier , it began to have one of the social problem for nowadays .
We would like to find out some several reasons and examples for this issue .

For young people , they are getting intended to spend more time with his or her freinds rather than spending time with the communities in which could make more pressure and could have unfamiliar for their habits .
It is obvious that they have less pressure for meeting with their own friends and could enjoy their own lifestlye .
They are thinking that they better go to concert and watch the famous stars in the stages .

Educational problem could cause making young people to be more selfish .
Most of the young people have had lots of pressures for studying subjects in order to get a good grade and go to the better university and finally having a better job in which would make more salary .
They are thinking about their own interest and their lifestlye not the other people communities .

It is pretty sad to hear the more young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
People have to live together and communicate together whatever or whereever they live in the earth .
Losing personal time could minimize to do their own interest habits , but helping their communities is pretty impotant in order to make better society with positive thinking .
Young people will need to have sacrificing their spirits and to be more aggressive in order to make a better society and that could make a better world in the future and their family .

3708,645115.txt,P3,SPA,medium,"First of all , I thing this statement is something very common to listen nowadays , but I think it is n't true .

Each new year it is true than the young people is more busy in a lot of things , but It 's a social problem , bacause they have to study , to work , to learn other languages , and more to can find a good job .

I think this is the main reason to say that the young people do not give enouth time to helping their communities , but do n't they study to improves their knowledges and with them help their communities ?

I think so !

For example , lot of young people use their summer holidays to go to places where they can rebuild old buildings , or help old people , ...

On the other hand , I suppose that is very important the education that they have received in their houses , if their parents were woried about teach them the importance of the enviroment , helping old people or mantein the places cleaned , I think they try to have enough time to do that .

However , I can understand the statement bacause nowadays everybody live very fast , I mean , you have to do one thousand of thinks during the day and frecuently you have n't time to think about all that isuues , nevertherless not only young people , but also everybody .

Finally , I wish everybody had a little time a week to think about this and do something to solve this problem .

5779,1006488.txt,P2,DEU,high,"In order to compare the lives of young people and older ones , it seems necessay to start off with a brief description of that average young and the average older person .

Young people enjoy themselves in activities such as meeting friends , going out , doing sports or listening to music .
On one hand , these activities are fun and help a young person to relax after an exhausting day at school or work .
But on the other hand all these activities can not be enjoyed without a certain amount of money .
Because of that , young people can easily get into a rush of working real hard , maybe even having a job while studying at a high school or university , and spending the money in the evenings and on their weekends .
They keep switching directly from the status of making money into spending it and forget to just settle down for a moment and simply sit down and read a book or something like that .

Sometimes young people even start working almost nonstop so that they can just stop most of their work and have fun later in life , which is the worst of all cases .

Older people are usually the opposite .
Most of the retired people enjoy a slow day without getting in rushes or being stressed .
They have no fear of sticking to everyday habits , which provides a basis for a settled and enjoyable life .
They do n't feel like they miss out on things when they go to bed early every once in a while which is a problem a lot of young people share .

If people try to compare these two different types of enjoying life , a basic problem shows up immediately .
If someone put a older person into a young persons position , he or she would think its unbelievably stressful .
On the other hand , the young person would probably call the older persons life enitrely boring .
The only difference is that most of the young people enjoy their lives at a way higher risk of becoming stressed and getting in a rush with things .

So after all , a young person doe n't enjoy life more than an older person does , both enjoy life just in totally different ways .
Still one should not forget the fact that we are discussing stereotypes here ; there might still be a lot of people at all ages that do n't enjoy their lives .

769,123556.txt,P7,DEU,high,"I totally agree with this statement because of several reasons .
First of all I want to mention an experience .
In my final classes at school I got a complete different type of teacher in the history course .
The previous one wanted us to learn dates .
The new teacher organised his lectures completely different .
For him it was important that we understood the whole picture , the process of history and the relationship between important events in time instead of learning dates .
That was very interesting and much easier to learn because everybody understood why the things happened and in which chronology .

From my point of view it is important that the students \ pupils have fun by learning the objectives .
To understand the idea is in my opinion always more interesting than learning facts .

The next point in my argumentation is the importance of understanding the idea itself .
If somebody does not understand the idea behind for example an economic model he cannot explain what he calculated .
Another example is if somebody did not get the message of marketing and how it functionates , he probably will write a good test because he learned the marketing Ps or something like this , but he will never be able to work as a marketer .
The reason for this is that he did not understand the concept behind marketing and probably will not remember the 4 Ps , although he had learned them .

Here we are at my third point .
The remembering of something .
If somebody has understood anything it should be no problem for him to remember this idea after a long period of time .
It is in his mind .
He will never forget it because he understood the reason , the porpuse behind the concept .
For this argument it is also important to look at the circumstances the idea was established .
By understanding how the idea came upon it is also easier to understand the idea itself .

At the end I want to say , that I am really thinking that understanding something is more important then learning only the facts , although sometimes it has to be .

9120,1452259.txt,P4,HIN,medium,"I agree with the statement that most advertisenments make products seem much better that they really are but not always .
Media nowdays plays a big role in making correct decisions .

Advertisements are used to promote selling of products so that the company can have profits .
It is never for the sake of one 's good .
Companies care for their profits and loss and that 's the reason why laws have been enforced for making advertisements to protect privacy of people and filter the content of the advertisement .

Insurances are to protect people not to show their lifestyle or something .
By saying that what I mean is the better insurance that you get people think that the better off you are .
By better insurance I mean the reputed one or the one that has a lot of media influence .
For ex , I see an advertisement for Geico Car Insurance almost everyday on the T.V. trying to get more customers by saying that their prices are lower , but what it turns out to be is that they reduce prices in one place but make up for that and profits in another section .

It is basically tricking people .
Like if you do n't you well on a certain part of the test you try to make up for it in the other section but it does n't help because it affects your grade anyways .

Advertisements are not always like that they sometimes they are made in favor of the well being of the people .
For ex. There is ad which asks parents to be friendly with their teenage children and talk to them about not going on the wrong way like becoming alcoholic or smoking .
I think that ads like that are not bad and they just help reduce generation gaps in my views .

In conclusion , it depens on the type of the ad wheter it is trying to make the product seem much better or not .
But most of times the statement is unfortunately true .

10824,1765478.txt,P6,SPA,high,"This statement is true and false .
First of all , when there is a lot of people traveling toguether it may be better to travel with a tour guide , because is difficult for many pepple traveling toguether to maintain an order , and they can get lost , or they may disagree of certain places to go .
Traveling with a group can result in many problems and a lot of difficulties during the travel , so the best way to manage that is by having a tour guide .

I think in my personal opinion that the best way is to travel alone .
The person traveling alone can collect information from internet , magazines or books , and go to that strange country by her | himself , and do the best he | she can to visit the best and most wonderfull places in that country and experience for her | himself .

Its true that the tour guide is more experienced in visiting the place you dont know , but people learn better when they have to figure out things by themselfs .
For example , when you go to a museum , before you go , if you are alone , you need to investigate about it , and learn about it and things of that nature , so you can confirm that this museum is a good place for you to visit .
In the contrary , when someone is in a group led by a tour guide , there are a lot of distractions , because of the quantity of people in the group , and is more difficult to pay attention or to look at pictures for example in a museum , when there is a lot of people following a tour guide .

Another important thing is that when you are in a group led by a tour guide , you have to follow that group where they go , instead of going where you wish to go , and where your feelings take you .
For me being in a vacation is doing whatever you want and whenever you want to do it , so being with a tour guide is like being in a school trip , and you cant do what you wish to do .

Tour guides are perfect for school trips or things of that nature , because kids need to follow someone .

9022,1435543.txt,P2,ITA,medium,"I agree with the statement .
Infact I believe that young people enjoy life more than older people because they find it more interesting , they still have to affront many life 's problems , they still have to feel every sensation , they still have to know how life could be horrible sometimes , they still have to know a lot of life-s part that old people already know .

For example sometimes my mother tell me how I could affront a problem because she have already affronted a situation like mine and I love when she does it .
Everyday young guys and girls feel that there is a big and awesome world in front of them which is waiting them .
I love this sensation .
I love have a lot of dreams about my future , I like think that I can do what I want about my life because everything depends by me .
I know that it 's not like this , there are a lot of problems that I will have to affront during my life , but I prefer to convince myself that with my forces I 'll be able to arrive where I want to .

Old men and women believe that their life is an habit ; for example , they already know what they will do next summer because they will do what they did last year and the year before .
I want that my mother and my father understand that they are still young , they have to live their life as I uually do with mine .
What they usually tell me about my life are important informations for me to resolve my problems , but they have to enjoy their life .
For example they could go away for two days without me and my brother or they could change habits and go out for dinner sometimes .
When they talk about what they did when they where younger I can see how much they miss that period and I feel bad ...
Maybe next Christmas I could ask to the Big Man , as we call him to remember to my parents

This is because that helping their communities includes to spend their time to see their friends , I think .
Young people join a lot of events of their universities .
We can not say that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
Actually , a lot of students spend their time to work rather than help their communities , but they have enough time to join their communities .
Young people can manage their schedule , so when they want to join them , they can go .
There are a lot of clubs and circles they can join their communities .
And also universities give students a lot of oppotunities to participate in communities .
During high school and junior high school , students have a little time to help their comunities really , but it is not students ' fault .
That is because the government deside to the system of schools .
If they had enough time , they would give time to helping their communities .
After university , we are able to have a lot of time to cope with our communities .
In Japan , we should help our communities .
We have a lot of kinds of helping , for example , to help some shops of their home towns , clean up roads , rivers , and stations .
Throught those kinds of experience , Japanese young people are able to learn how they join their communities .
And after that , they help their communities by themselves .
Finally , I think that all young people give enough time to helping their communities on their own way .
From someones ' point of view , it does not seem to be like that .
But , we have enough oppotunities to help our communities , we can not avoid them .
And we think that we have to that .
So , I believe that young people nowadays give enough time to helping their communities .

10368,1688249.txt,P5,TUR,medium,"CARS IN TWENTY YEARS
Today 's world is changing rapidly and during this change people invent lots of new things that makes life easier .
Once cars were a dream and now it is almost impossible for a man to travel without them , but what about twenty years from now ?
Will they become ancient history or will it still be very important ?

Cars will continue to be important for daily life however it is possible that the number of cars that will be used diminish .
There are many reasons for that , such as , people became more aware about environmental issues and since one of the major causes of air pollution is the usage of cars so in the future people may use less cars and more of buses or trains , it will also be helpful for traffic jam because roads are not sufficient anymore to handle all the cars .

Second reason why the cars may be less used is the technology is growing very fast , as mentioned above the cars were also a dream which came true , so in the future it is possible that scientist may invent something new that costs cheaper and move faster so people start buying these things and cars will be less used and their number may diminish .

One other thing about cars is : today cars are seen as a person 's wealth .
The more money one has the number of cars or the luxury of the cars increases too , so it is some kind of a fashion show .
If this idea changes people will stop buying new cars and the number of cars that will be used become fewer .

As a result , it is very possible for the number of cars to diminish in the future , due to several reasons , however it is not possible for them to get entirely out of human daily life .
At least not in a twenty year period .

9550,1540999.txt,P4,TUR,high,"The Role of Advertising in Modern Societies

Advertising is one of the most popular areas of the developing industry .
In order to sell a product , one must put great effort to introduce the society , the new product .
Without an effective advertising campaign , this is a difficult goal to achieve .
The aim of advertising is making the product better known , and better sold .

Seing a product commonly , creates a feeling of trust in many people .
It may mean that many people are using that product and as there are no complains about the product , everybody is happy about using it .
Therefore one would like to give that product a chance .
Being well known is one of the best approaches in being a widely trusted trade mark .

The advertisments may exaggerate the quality of the product .
This is a technique often used to effect the customers .
Many people believe in what they read in the newspapers or what they see in the television .
For instance an advertisment of a detergent , may say that , the detergent can cleanse every kind of spoil , including coffee , tomato or grass spoils .
Although in the truth it may not be capable of removing the dirt completely , one could easily trust in that advertisment .
After using that product , a good result may not be obtained .
Nevertheless a loyal customer may think that , the problem could be related to his \ her washing maschine .
This simple example demonstrates that , the advertisers has a point in making products seem much better than they really are .
Although ethically it is not right to cheat on people , no one can claim that the technique is not clever .

In order to survive in the world of competiton , one should do his/her best to get a piece from the cake .
Therefore I agree with the exageration of products in advertisments .

3932,682130.txt,P5,HIN,high,"I believe that there would be more cars 20 years down the lane than there are today .
My statement is based on below facts .

As of now only 7 % of the world population is using cars .
Mostly this population resides in developed countries .
The ratio of people using cars in developing and under developed countries is very low , due to poverty or shortage of disposable income to be spent on luxury .
The statistics show an upward trend in income of people living in developing and under developed countries

For example , number of cars on road in developing countries like India and China have seen a 30 % growth annually over the last decade .
Other countries are joining this race .

Further the government of such countries are also providing infrastructure in terms of roads .
Hence , using a car becomes easier .
In addition , the world is moving towards globalisation .
With this , availaibilty of cars for sale and availaiblity of wider range of cars like cost effective cars is being witnessed .
Hence , people would be able to buy and mainatin a car more conviently , than today .

For example , in last 2 decades there has been a 300 % increase in number of people directly or indirectly involved with automotive industry .
This is only possible if the automotive industry is showing very positive growth signs .

Moreover , the change in outlook of people .
Cars which were once considered a luxury are now being viewed as neccessasity to remain mobile .

One more very underlying but important reason for people not to buy cars is its running cost i.e. cost of fuel the car runs on .
With invention of cars which run of water , solar energy or japharta ( a seed which can produce pertol ) and other such biodegrable sources , using a car would gradually become cheaper and envioremental friendly , encouraging more people to buy & use car .

Further rate of car being disposed of as non usable is very low , as technology is available to refunction and reuse them .

All the development mentioned above is taking place gradually and it will see its peak after to 18-20 years .
Hence , my claim .

515,94398.txt,P6,SPA,medium,"Traveling is an oportunity for sharing with people , but mostly to discover wonderful things on land .
If you go with a a group of friends , it turns a really enjoyful experience and if you decide to be guided by tour guide probably you will Know new beautiful places .
However not always the tour guide shows all the places to meet so in that case , is better to try guiding yourself along with your friends .

usually the tour guides have an specific tour and they did not change it so often , also they have specific activities to develop within your group .
So , when you are being guided you must follow all the time the tour guide and you could not explore yourself other wonderful places .

Traveling in group without a tour guide , allows you and your friends to discover by yourselves the wonderful parts that a new place have .
Also , you can surprise with other things you find special , so I consider that it is better to travel in group , therefore enjoying with friends , but you must experience by yourselve at the time yo make a tour with a tour guide .

4762,830184.txt,P5,ZHO,high,"With the swift and tremendous development of industry , people are making every effort to enjoy life .
In the mean time , the industrial growth also brings huge damages to human living conditions .
The air pollution produced by over use of vehicles is a warn that people should cut down on the application of them , which leads me to believe that in 20 years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

To begin with , the abuse of cars has caused severe environmental issues .
Many people have been in possession of cars for quite a long time .
They travel by car , go to work in a car , and even discuss commercial transactions in the moving status since it is an efficient way to promote the dealings .
However , it is commonly realized that gasoline consumption may lead to undoubtedly serious environmental problems including but not limited to air pollution and infectious diseases concerning lung functions .
The gas emitted by the engine is a detriment to human living surroudings , which can damage human lungs , limiting the function of breathing to carry adequate oxygen to every part of huamn bodies .
On the other hand , such emitted gas can drift in the air for a long time possibly becoming the excellent medium for the growth of bacteria .

Furthermore , nowadays , more and more people are wary of the problems caused by cars .
People , aiming at sustainable development , are undergoing a lot of measures to control the damages .
Scientists are conducting experiments to evaluate the results of car produced gas .
Service workers are promulgating the latest or maybe recent findings of them to guide people in a correct direction -- decrease the use of cars .

People can also enhance their health by other alternatives of cars .
They may practise their strength and endurabililty by riding or running in stead of driving .
In this way , people force themselves to use their own muscles and energies which is a both economic and effective way to improve their health and weight loss , a popular issue , may also be realized .

In a word , in my view , use of cars will become less and less in 20 years in that it results in rigid environmental damages , and people may become healthier by abandoning cars despite that cars without gasoline consumption may be produced out in a mass since the use of cars may increase human weight , causing a lot of problem relating to blood pressure and heart functions .

1878,323746.txt,P7,DEU,medium,"I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts , as in the future carreere working on concepts is needed .
Only knowing some facts of a special theorie does not help to resolve a probleme , for example !

Example : In my interneship at the company LAVAZZA I receveid a task , namely to resolve a problem in the marketing departure .
Therefore I did need special facts about the problems topic , but the facts were not required from the company .
I had the possibility to look the facts up in the internet if I needed them .
But the important point was to know how it is the best way to form the concept and how to develope the suitable ideas of this problem .
The companz required these factors :

1. understanding the problem task
2. working on the problem task
3. finding solutions for the problem task

Moreover I think that facts are the base for working on special topics or better an advantage for working on a topic .
One should learn facts , but the most important point for students is to learn to understand special ideas and concepts in order to use them in the future .
Otherwise , only knowing the facts , without knowing how to work with them , is not helpful for future tasks .
Sure , there will be people who would be impressed , when they hear that you know various facts about o topic by heart , but only facts will not fulfill the requirements of a company one works in .

As a resume it can be said , that facts are basically important to learn , but not as much important as understanding ideas and concepts , as it is not enough only knowning facts without having the capabality to work with them , for example to make a concept .

The combination of learning facts and on the same time understanding the idea or the concept would be perfect !

7066,1120749.txt,P1,TUR,high,"I do not agree with this statement .
Broad knowledge of a specific subject might not be enough to solve all the problems and answer all the questions about the issues concerning this subject .
So we would definetly need experts of certain subjects to solve our problems in related areas .
We , human beings , developed a lot and we know much more than we can handle .
There is so much to learn .
Individuals can have enough time only to master a certain subject since reading and experimenting would take a life time .
It is better to concentrate on one thing so that you can be rated as an expert and have a good professional life .
There are more than 6 billion people on earth and people are becoming more and more educated .
So there is so much competition in academic and professional arena .
To be able to leave others behind , you need to excel in what you do .
Let me give you a few specific example .

I am a computer engineer and I could have been either a hardware orientent person or a software engineer .
I had to make that choice and concentrate because both areas are vast and I can have enough time only for one of them to learn and master it .
So I chose software engineering .
In this way , I can sell myself as an expert on software area and have a promising professional life .
Because , compaines require specific knowledge about many software products .
So I would need to spend a lot of time for example , on a programming language and learn it to the best of my abilities .
This would be possible when I spent enough time on it and this becomes true if I try to specialise on software engineering by not trying to know everything .
Of course , I should have broad understanding of other areas like , different programming languages or even basic understanding of hardware but that is just to make my life easier not to sell my services as an expert of everything about computers .
First of all , nobody would believe me since it is impossible to know everything .

Another advantage of being a specialist is the fact that you can not be replaced easily since there will not be many experts in your area depending on what you do .
For example my position in my current project is quite secure although many lay-offs are going on since there is not anyone to replace me .
So specialisation secures you a good place in society and in your professional life .

Today the world is demanding .
We are able to live on the moon even .
So we progressed fast .
We know much more than we used to do and this means that our brains have much smaller capacity than what is there to store and comprehend .
This forces me to recommend specialisation as a philosophy .
I think this is a must nowadays ...
Otherwise , as individuals we may not be able to contribute to the society enough .

9802,1586562.txt,P1,JPN,low,"I agree that .
In my case , I agree .
There are few reasons .
First of all , having a lot of Knowledge makes me live easily and useful .
For example , When I see a TV news program , I can understand almost of every issues and have my own opinions against them .

Secondly , having a plently of broad Knowledge means having a lot of topics to talk about .
For example , when I go to a party , I have to talk to a person who I do n't know .
At the time , we should talk something .
If I know a lot of topics , making a conversation is easily .
When we first meet a person , we do n't talk about specific subject deeply except some kind of academic meetings .

Ofcourse , a person who mastered a specific subject can help many person or things .
For example , doctors , lowers , scientists , etc .
However , I am not the kind of person .
My way is that ask a specialist when I do n't know .
So , they are .
Conclude , I agree that it is better to know many subjects than to know one specific subject .

for this reason who make spot want to realize something that capture the attention of consumers in every way .
but we do not often pay attention to them and so we do not check if the spot messages corrispond exactly to reality .
in this way the spots can easily influence who are hearing them especialy children that have not a lot of experiences and they often belive everything we tell them .
this aspect can be dangerous for children who are not able to check the bad an dangerous sides of some products for example the medicine spot .

so i think that autorithies must controll much more every spot and all advertisements of products in order to give more good infomation to consumer
