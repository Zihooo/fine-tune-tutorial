"Actually in this situation I really feel very bad and really boring, then mainly very uncomfortable infront of unknow strangers, ie. With the feeling like don't know what to do and how to react to the situations that's going on there and I would best use my mobile phone wifi or internet to overcome the waiting period for my friend's arrival by playing some games or watching some news or entertainment stuff along with having some concious looks like what and all is happening in my surroundings and who and all are doing what surrounding my presence.",3.333333333
"I would feel a little awkward, but would introduce myself to the hosts first, make smalltalk and scan for anyone I could probably know, even if just a little bit, to help pass the time and talk to. I would get a drink to have something to hold on to. I'd probably text my friend to get an estimate of when they'd be arriving and inform the host. In the meantime I would just enjoy meeting new people and maybe make some new acquaintances I'd otherwise not have made. I'd remind myself to always try and meet up somewhere else first, close to the site of the party but not AT the party to avoid such situations in the future.",3.5
"I'd feel awkward since I don't know anyone. I'd feel out of place, since I'm a guest and no in the inner circle. I'd probably look down as people approached. I'd only speak if I was spoken to first. I'd fiddle around with my phone awkwardly as well. I'd check out some social media and maybe play some games while I was waiting. If he took too long I would text him a few times to ask about his where abouts. If he eventually showed up I'd just leave. When I leave I'd probably pick up some food then go straight home, feeling really annoyed.",2
"I would be a little nervous at first. I have been in this situation many times so I would not really be that worried at first. Unless the host wasn't very good or the crowd was really different than I am used to I would just start meeting people and hope my friend arrived fairly quickly. It wouldn't really matter because at some point I would have to start meeting people besides my friend and move around without her. Other than that I wouldn't do anything else. I wouldn't wait outside or in my car until my friend came. I may feel a bit awkward, but nothing out of the ordinary and nothing to avoid the situation.",4.5
"I would feel awkward and out of place. I would be annoyed at my friend for being late, and would be extremely uncomfortable. I would probably try to stay in the corner and not interact with others if I could avoid it. If there was alcohol available I would definitely be drinking. If my friend did not arrive after a period of time, perhaps an hour, I would leave because I would be miserable by myself in that kind of environment. I would probably spend most of my time drinking if it was available and playing on my cell phone or perhaps browsing the Internet as a kind of shield so I did not need to talk to other people.",1.166666667
"I would probably be upset, since I'm only doing this for them. First, I would call my friend and see how long it will take for them to arrive. If they are going to be a while, then I would likely go back to my car and wait for them. I would ask my friend to call or text me when they arrive. Since I don't know anyone at the party, I would feel like it would be kind of rude to go the party uninvited. When my friend did arrive, I would probably give them a really hard time in a joking manner about then being late and making me wait. In the end though, I'm sure we would have a good time once we went into the party.",3.916666667
I wait up to thirty minutes from the start time of the party after that I call my friend and ask her where is she? I get the information from her that where she is right now and then I go to Coffee shop have some nice dark coffee with medium sugar and waiting for my friend in the coffee shop. If she does not come after thirty minutes of the party time I myself directly get in to the party room and start to drink some beer and waiting there for fifteen minutes again she will not come at the time means start speak with some one in the party who does not look strange to me and then offer them drink and waiting and then I starting to enjoy the party with my new friends up to my friend will come to the party.,3.5
I would feel mortified. More than likely once I realize that my friend is not there I would go back to my vehicle and wait or supposing I had texted my friend and found out that my friend wasn't there I wouldn't have left my vehicle. I would sit in my car and wait for my friend to show up before going into the party. I'm not a fan of parties and I feel scared and a bit of a panic to go into something I do not know by myself. I would rather wait until my friend shows up.,1.333333333
"In this type of situation, I would feel like an alien at that party because I don't know anyone there and people would judge me who am I and what I am doing there. But I will call my friend right away and if my friend is going to arrive soon I would wait for my friend. If my friend would be very late, then I would ask him or her that what I should do now. If my friend could introduce me to someone at the party over the phone or guide me to talk to someone by providing their reference, I would definitely do that.",4.25
Well I will feel uneasy and will not enter where the party is being going on. I will call my friend and ask for his where about. If he comes late then I will wait outside for some time. Or I may look for some other good spots near by to roam around. Further when my friend come I will enter the party along with him only. I will enjoy myself and would like him to introduce myself with their close friends to whom I do not know. We will enjoy the food and drink together.,3.333333333
it is very annoying situation for me because I do not know anyone. And how I will adjust myself it is a big problem for me. I need someone that who will talk to me and spen time with me so I feel comfortable. But there is no one I tried to engage with unknown people to talk make contact with them for understand other people. It is best way to feel good around this people and spen time in this situation. I like to talk with people but in unknow party it is difficult to spend time to enagaging but I have to try my best. I will try from first host to make contact then with others.,3.333333333
The situation will be really ugly if I went to the place full of unknown person. I tried to call my friend first up. Will ask him how much time it takes for him to reach here. If he says less time then I will wait outside for him. If he says too much of time then I will go inside and introduce myself to the person who are of same age I am and tried to be friendly with them. If I feel comfortable then I continue to be there itself. If they are not friendly as I am then I may leave place and text my friend that I am leaving.,3.833333333
"I don't think I would stay without her. I would probably head outside the main party. Maybe sit on a bench, see if there is anyone else around I might know. I would feel nervous and maybe a little jittery. I would start calling my friend, wondering where she is, how long she might be taking to get there. I would stay by myself most likely unless I saw someone I knew, or someone who might be in the same situation as me. If it was going to be a while and I was determined to stay, I think I might TRY and strike up a conversation with someone.",1.833333333
"I am always one to arrive early, so this would be a typical situation that I can see myself in. As I waited, I know that I would feel extremely uncomfortable. Honestly, I wouldn't even go in until my friend arrived. As I waited for my friend, my irritation and level of discomfort would likely increase. After a few minutes, I might even just leave. I am not one to stay waiting around when I am uncomfortable. I would of course text my friend to see what their arrival time would be. If it was in a few minutes, I would simply wait uncomfortably and impatiently. If was longer, I am pretty sure I would just leave. It is not my style to wait around.",3.083333333
"I would feel rather awkward and out of place so I would try and blend in by getting a drink or food or whatever the other people there were doing. I would look around for anyone I even vaguely know to make conversation with. I would definitely call my friend or send a message and find out where they are, when they expect to arrive and some details about the people there. Who are they, who is the host and how do they known them et cetera. I would probably find some out of the way spot where I could observe the crowd and wait.",1.5
"First I feel upset and irritated about her absence and seeing the crowd. Suddenly I make a call to her and scolded and ask her to come quickly. Then I saw the crowd if anybody face is familiar to me or not. Then I try to talk with somebody. Later I took my phone and spoke to some of my friends. After that I use social media and chat with friends and uploaded pics. Then I try to know the current location of my friend. Again I make her call and spoke. After that I notice about the party,people,dresses everything. I just enjoyed the decorations,crowd and all.",3.333333333
Usually in these type of scenarios I feel very self conscious about where I am at. I try to introduce myself and say who I am coming with and hope that everything will be okay. Waiting for my friend would seem to be a long time though the time might be short. I would try to mingle with the other guest and probably head to the food table to get something to keep myself occupied while I wait. Hoping that my friend would soon arrive I would probably keep stuffing my face till the do.,2.916666667
"I would feel so out of place without my friend. I do not anybody and I worry that people are looking at me like I am so kind of prty crasher. I am a little irritated at my friend, but all would be forgiven if she would just show up. I see a just a few people who are vaguely familiar so I stride nervously in their direction and say watch them speak for a bit until I sense an opening and mutter a Hi. They seem kind of confused by my presence and it is painfully obvious they have no idea who I am and are not interested in including me in the conversation. I can feel sweat forming on my forehead and my face turning red. I feel like an idiot.",3.166666667
I would feel very awkward and also irritated that my friend was late. I would not want to be alone with people I did not know so I would wait in my car. I would also call my friend and see how long they would be. If people noticed me in my car I would drive around the block or something until my friend got there. I would be upset and feeling anxious and I would feel that way for a while even after my friend arrived. I would listen to music or check my make up and hair if I waited in my parked car.,3
"I would wait in my car for my friend and call him or  her to see what's going on. I would feel embarrassed since I wouldn't know anyone at the party, so I would believe it was better to stay in my car until my friend arrives. I would not feel upset with my friend until I know what's happening. I wouldn't have a problem with disappearing from the party one I find out my friend wasn't there, because they wouldn't know who I was anyway. I would also have no problems returning to the party when my friend arrives.",2
"I would try and be calm as getting mad at her will worsen my mood. I would get a drink if they are offering. Then I would try network by socializing and knowing the people in the party. By sharing different ideas and talking about things that happen in our daily lives will help pass time as I wait for my friend. If the host is free I would try engage her and get to know her better, Knowing their interests, likes and dislikes. I would also ask how they know my friend and why they had the party.",4.166666667
"Actually, this is what I try to hold all of my life, stuck in the middle of something where I don't know anything or anyone but myself. I would probably try to find a space where people will not even think of talking to me as I am very awkward at situations where you have to socialize with random strangers that know each other. It is great if we all don't know each other but at that point I would probably think that most of them know each other. The space should be hidden enough not to attract suspicions and good enough not to look pathetic or very anti-social. While waiting, I would surely call my friend to ask what's up. I would try to find his location and calculate how many minutes it would take him to get to the party. If it takes more than 2 hours, I would probably just leave, I have honored my word and done my part. But if he says that he's nearby then I would just wait in there.",2
"I am not a party person so it would have to be a very good friend for me to agree to go, let alone meet them there. But assuming that I did agree when I realized my friend was late my first thought might be something along the lines of I'm getting out of here but then I would take a deep breath and look around to see where I could get a drink. At least with something in my hand I would feel a little more at ease. After that, I'd look around and try to find someplace I might inject myself into the conversation without appearing too geeky or pathetic.",1.833333333
"Yes really its frustrating. Because no one there know us. First thing I search for some one who familiar to me. If I found that person, Then I mingle with them until my friend. If not I go for the corner of the place where no one notice me. And call my friend to come to party as soon as possible. My mind set will so calmless and searching for some familiar face. My mind frustrated. Then I make a friend. Because If there is lot people gathering in one place. One person definitely face the situation like us. So find them and accompany them and make them as party friend.",2.75
It will be a difficult situation for me and I will not be comfortable with guests in the party. It will be bit disappointing. I will try to take some food and drink to keep myself engaged until my friend reaches. I will try to talk to some guys. I will talk to my family and friends in the mean time. I will utilize my time to finish of my some work over mobile and will play some games. It will be boring for me to keep myself busy that way.,2.75
"If my friend is late, I will wait silently. I am sure that a person who is inside will notice my presence and I will inform what I have come for. I never feel regret to wait and believes she is late because of unavoidable circumstances. I will engage myself in the crowd so that I don't waste my time unnecessarily. It will be a different experience because I don't know any one there. I will try to organize with the situation I am really for. Usually I get adjusted to such situations and so it will not be a great problem for me.",3.166666667
"When I arrive and realize that my friend is late, I would first feel very alone and disappointing in them. I would text them and ask when they think they will arrive. I would then make my way over to the drink area, making sure to smile and look up and try and make any sort of connection with someone in the room. I would get myself a nice tall drink and start mingling. I would walk up to groups and introduce myslef and make some sort of joke about my date not being here. I would really start drinking and open up and hopefully be friendly.",3.666666667
"First of all I hate, absolutely hate being at an event or place where I don't know anyone. I am already pretty awkward so I try to avoid situations where I am the outsider or the loner in front of a bunch of other people who know each other. I would probably face time or call my friend multiple times asking her whats going on, and why she is late. Knowing me I would probably eat the little party foods and drink to keep myself occupied with something instead of just standing there looking like a creep. Oh and I would go on social media like YouTube and Instagram to keep and look busy.",2.083333333
"I would not wait for my friend, I would instead leave the party. I hate parties and I would have been on the fence about the whole thing anyway so I would have taken this opportunity as an excuse to leave. I would call my friend and tell them that I wasn't comfortable being there without them and that, since they were late, I would be leaving. I have actually had this experience myself in the past. My friend was planning a birthday meeting FOR ME and he was an hour late, along with the people he was bringing. I got angry and left. I will never, ever do that again.",2.5
"I would introduce myself to the host, explain that I was attending with my friend and ask if they had heard from them at all. I would then say that I hoped they didn't mind me arriving alone and be honest that it made me feel a little uncomfortable, make a joke about it. Depending on how they responded I would either continue that conversation or find a quiet corner where I could try and contact the friend who was late to get an idea of where they were and how long they would be. If I couldn't get hold of them I might then start to wonder if something has happened. If I couldn't get hold of the friend after maybe forty-five minutes, I would consider leaving the party. If I decided to leave I would find the host and thank them for their hospitality and explain why I was leaving. I would leave a message with the host for my friend if I hadn't managed to speak to them.",3.333333333
"Normally one should feel fish out of water in this kind of a situation. But as far as I am concerned, I will try to call the host, and make sure his arrival and the tentative time. Meanwhile I will try to find out somebody who may know me and try to mingle with the other guests until the arrival of the host. I expect this type of party will be having some cultural programmes or other activities to pass the time which is obviously a right option to pass time. I will sit for any such programmes if I find none familiar in the gathering. I will also have drink and sit patiently for the arrival of my host who will help me get interact with the guests.",2.666666667
"I would be extremely uncomfortable for starters, and as the party got going, the longer my friend was late, I would become more and more agitated. I do not like parties, nor do I like crowds of people especially if they are all strangers to me. I would search the faces at the party to see if there was someone, anyone that I would maybe even remotely recognize. If I didn't, then I would stand close to the front door of the venue where the party was being held and keep to myself until my friend arrived. I would not be happy about this situation at all. Given enough time alone, as my mood grew darker, I might also just leave and go home, if it looked like my friend was not going to show up. I would be texting or trying to call them until I got through, and if I didn't, I most certainly would not stay. I would leave and go home.",1.75
"If my friend were late to a party, I would just mingle with the people around me. I'm a social butterfly and love to make new friends so going to a party where I'm not familiar with anyone doesn't really bother me. I'll have a few drinks and grab some food before my friend shows up. If he or she is still running late after 30 mins, I should have made a few friends by this point and I'll stay depending on the mood of the party, and have a good time. I'm not usually one to stay out TOO late, Ie 1 AM, but I'll stay up for a bit. If that friend never shows up after 1 to 2hrs of me being at this party, I would leave, no matter how much of a good time I was having. Sleep is important to me and I value it.",4.166666667
"I will really feel embarrassed, but will try to tackle the situation. I will try to wait outside the party hall and wait for her. If someone inquires, I will tell them the truth as I hate speaking lies. I will keep on calling her once in 10 mins. If I come to know that it will take more time to reach there, I will just start from that place and ask her to meet me in another place or another day and will definitely shout at her for making me stand in a place of strangers.",3.333333333
"I have a small group of friends and there are only a few that I would do something like this for. I would be happy to go with a friend even if I did not know anyone at the party. I would trust my friend's judgment of anyone that they would hang out with. I would as I always do, however, remain cautious of my surroundings. If my friend was late I would most likely make attempt to contact them via phone. If I was already among the guests I would find my way to the host and I advise that I was arriving with a friend that is late. Any host worth my friend's time would entertain me until my friend arrived.",3.166666667
This would make me feel very awkward consideridering that I do not know anyone else at the party. I would call and try to message my friend and see how much longer they are going to be. I would try to wait in my vehicle until my friend shows up amd if I could not get in touch with my friend then I would leave and go somewhere else until I heard back from the friend. When I know they are there at the party then I would consider going back to the party.,4.5
"I would be unsure of what I should do, but if I am already there, I will go inside. I would figure that I may as well get comfortable as early as I can. I would introduce myself to everyone there, and start chatting with them. By the time my friend arrives, I might already have made friends with some of them. On top of that, in the middle of it, if my friend is still to late to showing up, I might step out for a moment to try calling them on their cellphone, with mine. If they haven't arrived in time, I might start to worry and hope that they're okay, and hearing their voice would help ease that.",4.416666667
"I would wait a reasonable amount of time. If my friend does not show up, I would call this an opportunity. I do not really know the people but I can remedy that. I would go in and start meeting others. I would find out what we have in common. I would not push myself on people but by the end of the evening, I would have met many new people. Some might turn into business clients, others into sources of information. A few might become good friends in the future and I might even meet a new girlfriend. The possibilities are endless. If my friend does finally show up, I would be glad to see him. We would enjoy ourselves and it would become even easier to meet people as he would make introductions.",4.083333333
Ok so if I'm in this situation I'll just let the friend be waited on and I'll just wait my turn because you just never know how to Handle such situations that are just bound to happen you know things just seem to get out of hand and if you don't make sure that this thing was to say go another way then things would be totally different in how the way you would handle such situations if there was nothing to handle then just let it happen or you can just make sure not to get into anything like this in the future.,3
"Once I enter the meeting, I will start going towards the place where the drinks are kept. So while taking a drink I will start interacting with the person who is next to me. So tell him about the business I do and what am as a person. Will try to interact with the person to know about him. So I can pass on my time till my friend arrive to the party. Also mean while will ask my friend to share his friends or known people contact, so I can connect this them and keep my self occupied. Will try to see if any person is alone will go and start a conversation so even that person will feel good as he might be feeling lonely.",4.5
I reached the wedding venue to meet my friend who was supposed to be there before my arrival. Unfortunately she was delayed due to a traffic jam. I was a bit embarassed and feeling awkward amidst the strangers but had no other alternative but to handle the situation. I went and occupied a seat in one corner and decided to wait for my friend. Meanwhile I saw a couple come and occupy the seats next to me with a cute little three year old girl. The cutie smiled at me and I started playing with her. Slowly the mother of the girl started a conversation and we got so engaged that never know how the time flew away and suddenlyheard my frien calling out my name.,3.583333333
"I would be a little nervous, but I would still go into the party. I would try to introduce myself to the people at the party that I didn't know. I would also try to strike up a conversation with them and find common things to talk about. I would be courteous and respectful as I would be a guest in their house. When my friend arrives, I feel much more relaxed and at ease, however, but I would definitely try to break the ice on my own. I want to get to know the people at the party because it is an opportunity to make new friends.",4.75
"At first, I would probably be a little upset with my friend for being late, but I would go into the party and start making friends on my own. I do not have a problem talking to people, and I definitely wouldn't in this situation. I am very easy to get along with and I love talking to and meeting new people. Eventually, my friend would probably show up and would not believe that I am already inside enjoying the party. I would enjoy the evening, even if my friend did not show up at all.",4.916666667
"I would first try and call my friend to see where they are and how long they will be. As I do not know anybody at the party, I might hang back before going in depending on how long my friend is, I may even stay on the phone to them while I wait. If the wait was a long time, I would probably go in and start meeting people and introduce myself, as there would be no point waiting outside for a long time if my friend was going to be very late. I may not know who is hosting the party, but I may still know other guests. I would be comfortable in this situation.",3.916666667
"I never like to go anywhere if there would be no familiar face there with me most especially parties or group meetings. For a friend to stand me up after inviting me to a party where he or she knows I know no one there is totally unacceptable for me and I would never want to go to any other party they invite me to. In the period where I am alone awaiting my friends arriving while also looking very awkward and strange in the party, a lot of things would be running through my mind like getting out of there and never coming back or turning off my phone and ignoring that friend for a very long time.",2.666666667
"I am a punctual kind of person. I value time as money. When I arrived at the party and could not find my friend there, it is going to be a very uncomfortable situation for me. As I am not a person who can mix up with strangers easily. I will went to the soft drinks or juice counter and try to pass my time in the absence of my friend. I will call my friend few times and try to talk with her and ask when she is arriving at the venue. In the mean time I will look at the people and see if I can find someone to talk to.",2.833333333
"If my friend was late, I would at first probable get pretty frustrated as I do not know anyone at the party, and anyone who knows me, knows that I have anxiety when it comes to new situations and facing them alone. However, with that sad, some situations cannot be avoided, and who knows why my friend is late, but in the meantime, I mine as well make the best of it. I would walk around the party and probable get myself a drink and see if there were any conversations I would be able to jump into. It is always nice when people are inviting, and I can read people pretty well.",3.333333333
"Well in such scenario I will call my friend to know exactly how much more time I have to wait for him and after disconnecting the call I may open my facebook to see if there is any updates from contacts after finishing with that I will check my emails if there is any important mails and if there is any I will reply those emails, if still there is delay I may open some puzzle game in my smartphone and will spend time playing that till my friend arrives, If he is still getting late I may change the game till my friend arrives.",2.5
"I would have to text her and find out how many minutes is it going to take her to get there? I would estimate if it would be easier to stay there until she arrived. If I felt it was appropriate I would stay and introduce myself to people their. I would try to move around the room talk to people and get something to drink or eat. If she wanted me to wait for her somewhere else and arrive with her I would go to a close location and wait for her to let me know when she got there to walk in with her. If not, then I would stay and enjoy myself until she arrived.",4.666666667
"First of all I will inform the friend that I am already there at the party and tell him to come soon wherever he is. Then I will attend this important party and try to find someone close with whom I can talk. If I find someone then well and good to enjoy rest of the time, but if I didn't get someone, then what I will do is I will connect with the host and tell him the matter and through him I will get in contact with others and find new connections until my friend arrives at the party.",3.666666667
I would start to wonder if I made the right decision or not to meet my friend here. They know that I don't know anyone so they should either have made every effort to be here or to call to let me know what is going on. Since I don't know anyone I would most likely start by going outside to wait. While waiting I would try and see if I can contact my friend to find out what is going on and why they are late. If I cannot get a hold of them I would wait for a few minutes and try calling again. If I still can't get a hold of them I would leave a message and leave. If I am able to get a hold of them I would find out from them when they expect to arrive.,1.583333333
"First of all I would be a little bit angry with my friend. This friend knew that I wouldn't know anyone at the party and that I needed them to be there. But at this point there is nothing I can do but try to mix in with the crowd. I would probably go get a drink at the bar and see if anyone else is there by themselves as well. If I find someone like that I would strike up a conversation with them. Now I am not great at this, but I would do my best to make polite conversation. If I don't, this will be a very long night. If the conversation is good then I may have a new friend if not I am sure my other friend will be there soon.",3
"I will find some place to sit. Will observe what others are doing. I will feel awkward ofcourse but will try to sit cool. And will lookout for someone who is calm and just waiting like me and will try to chit chatt with him, and through him, I will try to know about others. And will take some drinks and wait for my friend. I will look for some interesting person or beautiful girls and I am attracted to her, I will try to get close to her or try to get her attention. But the ultimate aim will be to stay cool till the party finishes.",2.5
"I would initially feel a bit awkward and perhaps irritated with my friend because of their tardiness putting me in this predicament, but after getting settled in and observing the room, I would begin introducing myself to the host and to the other guests. I would tell people that I'm so-and-so's friend and make small talk until they finally show up. I tend to ask a lot of questions when I'm feeling socially uncomfortable to break the ice and usually find someone interesting for conversation or to network. If this doesn't happen, I look for animals to pet or kids to play with because they're usually a lot of fun or check out the food table. Good conversations often take place over a nice meal. Once my friend arrives, I would spend time visiting with them as well.",3
"In this situation, I would arrive to the party, and stand still for a while trying to find my friend in the crowd, than I would pretend I am doing something like using my smartphone. Than I would realize I could really use my smartphone in order to reach my friend, and ask they if they are in the party somewhere. If that does not help, I would try to reach someone nearby, some good looking girl for instance, with who I could start chatting afterwards, and ask if she knows my friend, and if she knows where he or she is.",2.666666667
"I would feel agreviated because I don't like being in situations like this. I would wait outside for 15 minutes and if my friend was not there by that time, I would leave. It is very important to me for people to be punctual and if I was invited to be somewhere at a specific time, that person better have enough courtsey to make sure that they are there at the correct time. I would not enter the party not knowing anyone ahead of time-very awkward for me and I do not like to put myself in that situation ever.",2.333333333
"I would feel annoyed that the friend who invited me to the party is late. However, I would make the most of the situation. First, I would head to the bathroom to kill a little bit of time, reapply lipstick, and check my hair for perfection. Then I would head to the bar, and stay close to that area for a while. I am better at chatting with men than women, so I would find a man who is alone and start a conversation with him. I'd first ask him how he knows the host, or what brings him to the party. I would allow him to guide the conversation from there. Hopefully by this time, my friend will have arrived, and I'll have made a new acquaintance.",3
"Honestly I would wait outside for my friend, but I would definitely not wait long before leaving and going home. I dislike parties with strangers and dislike late night events. A party starting at 9 pm is not my idea of a good time. I would feel very annoyed with my friend. For a friend to ask me to attend a party that late at night with strangers, I would be doing my friend what I would consider to be a favor. The fact that I am doing a friend a favor and the friend was late would not sit well with me.",2.583333333
"In this situation, I would feel a little weird. I would have my own beer and would crack it open to start the social lubrication. I would immediately text my buddy as well since I don't see them there. Depending on how packed the party is, I would either leave the situation, knowing the person is not there. This is assuming it's a massive house party and I would not be noticed. If there is a smaller gathering and you figure the other of the party would know your buddy, than I would stay and introduce myself to everyone and try to make friends.",4.916666667
I would feel a bit awkward at first. I would probably contact them via call or text to find out how long until they arrived. I would try to go in and start conversing with others and getting to know the crowd. I would hope that my friend was on their way and just possibly running a bit late. I would try to get a drink or maybe get some food to ease myself in the situation. If I felt really uncomfortable I would wait to go into the party until my friend actually arrived.,4
"First of all, this is absolutely unrealistic because I don't go to parties and I certainly don't go to one that starts at 9 pm. That said, if I did make such an unlikely decision, I would feel extremely angry at my friend for not being on time, and not knowing me they would be late, since all of my friends are aware I detest parties. I would go outside and call my friend to find out where she is, and to find out when she would arrive. If there was no response to my phone call, I would wait for a short period outside, and after about 15 minutes with no return call I would head back home, and continue trying to get in touch with her to make sure she is ok.",1.5
"Ok so if my friend invited me to a party where I have never met the host, and not familiar with the crowd attending I would defintly plan going together to avoid this situation. I would want to get ready together so she can tell me about the people, see if I'm dressed right, and inform me how to act. But, if we did go seperatly and I arrived on time and my friend was late then I would sit in my car and wait for her. While I waited I would call her to see where she was at, how long it would be, and if I had time for food.",2.75
"If my friend was late and I showed up early, I would do 1 of 2 things, depending on my current mood. I would either try to find the host of the party and introduce myself as my friend's guest and get a lay of the land. Hosts of parties often do well with introducing guests to each other, which might give me a path into a group or conversation to start making acquaintances while I wait for my buddy. My other course of action would be to visit the snack or drink table, and either bump into someone and start up a conversation or find somewhere out of the way and quietly observe while drinking my beverage of choice.",2.833333333
As iam new to the party hosted by my friend I will first of all contact my friend who has invited me to this party then I will try to interact with the unknown people in the party as iam person who can make friends easily so it will not be a big deal for me to survive in this party without my friend I will most interested in making the friend with the male persons I am too good looking to get interacted to girls so then I will surely scold my friend for being late to the party.,4.083333333
"Such situations can happen quite often and there is no pattern to follow for such a scenario. Coming back to me, as I am a very sociable person, I do not think I would have any problems. The first thing I would do would be to look for the host and introduce myself. She will tell me what I could do while waiting for my friend. I'll look at my friend's friends. If they exist I will approach them. If there are no other friends around I will point to a less crowded place for the party. If my friend continues to be late, I'll probably get me a drink to start the evening with and talk to a stranger.",4
"I would probably be waiting in my car and texting them. I really hate parties and especially hate parties where I do not know a soul. I have a hard time talking to people I do not know. So if I went inside to wait for my friend, I would not know what to do with myself. I get toungue tied and awkward when I have to speak to people I do not know. So I would probably be sitting in my car waiting for my friend to show up. I might be a little mad depending on how late my friend showed up.",1.083333333
I would probably feel extremely out of pace and awkward at this party while I waited for the arrival of my friend. I would more than likely go around slowly and introduce myself to the people at the party as a friend of a friend that is running late to the party. I would try to get my self comfortable with the people that are present at the party before my friend arrived so that it is easier and less awkward to wait around until that person arrives. I would probably also pull out my phone to keep myself busy as I wait for this person's arrival.,3.583333333
I am ready to wait for my friend. But unfortunately all other peoples are very unfamiliar to me. So I will decided to wait outside for my friend. Maybe I will contact my friend through phone and inform him to come fast as soon as possible. Because time is very important to me. But I want to know what is the situation he is late. I will wait for half an hour if he is not come I will definitely attend the party and inform the my friend is too late but he will come as soon as possible. This will help my friend to keep his good night among others. So I think I am very committed to my friend.,3.416666667
"If this were to happen to me, I would be slightly ok with the situation. I know how to adapt around people and uncomfortable situations, so I would first get a drink. I would the proceed to talk to anyone around me starting a conversation that is just general in nature. I am very good at this. I would be feeling slightly nervous and secure, but excited once I engage with another person that I do not know. It almost would feel like a challenge, and when I do good by talking to a stranger, I feel self rewarded. I would be bouncing from person to person talking to anyone around me.",4
"I probably would have waited outside until my friend comes. I don't know if she mentioned that I was joining her. I would text her to see if she's late and how much longer she will take to get there. If she gives me no response, I would wait maybe another 15 to 30 minutes more before going home. I dislike uncertain situations. And the idea of going to a party where I know not a single person kind of gives me a touch of anxiety. I hope in the end it works for the best.",2.5
"I would be anxious at first, and try to find the host of this party. I would explain who I was waiting for and who I was, so that the host dident think I was just some random person that I was there to have a good time and meet new people. As my friend was late, I would talk to a few people and grab a drink and wait. I feel the best thing to do in this situation is to act cool and calm and try to fit in rather than stand out. I would also look around and take in my surroundings and try to really enjoy myself while I was waiting for my friend to arrive.",3.583333333
"I'd feel a little let down by my friend, and I'd wait outside for them. I'd get increasingly frustrated with them, as I'm waiting on them to enter the party. I'd probably give them half an hour or so before I gave up, although that'd be flexible based on their communication. I tend to be pretty understanding if someone's running late, as I'm a parent and it sometimes can't be avoided. I would probably be pretty upset after anything more than a half hour waiting, although I'd do my best not to let it show, in order to support my friend.",2.666666667
"My knee jerk reaction is to just sit in the corner with a drink and people watch until my friend arrives. I don't have any interest in parties or small talk or just socialization in general, especially with people I don't know or care about it. But I'd try to be cool about it if someone came up and started chatting, for my friends sake, making sure to talk them up a bit if they come up in conversation. Apparently it's an important party so I'm assuming it's work-related, so may as well make my friend look good if I can.",1.75
"I would try to find the host if it's very obvious who the host is, and introduce myself if it's a small party. If it's a very large party, I would probably get on my phone and play some games to pass the time. If there is food, I would be eating the food while I wait. If it's a very small party I would probably have to introduce myself to everyone there and make conversation. If it's a big party I would try to remain unnoticed for as long as possible. I know my friend will show up eventually, even though she is going to be a little bit late. That's usually how friends are, they show up late to parties. Can't blame somebody for running late sometimes.",1.75
I am ready to wait for my friend. But unfortunately all other peoples are very unfamiliar to me. So I will decided to wait outside for my friend. Maybe I will contact my friend through phone and inform him to come fast as soon as possible. Because time is very important to me. But I want to know what is the situation he is late. I will wait for half an hour if he is not come I will definitely attend the party and inform the my friend is too late but he will come as soon as possible. This will help my friend to keep his good night among others. So I think I am very committed to my friend.,3.666666667
"I would be a little annoyed that my friend who wanted me to go with them to this party is late. They know I don't know the host, so I guess I'll just have to wait in my car until they get here. So, thank God I have my phone because I can get on the internet and pass my time at least doing something interesting while I wait. Maybe, I'll give someone I haven't talked to in a while a call and kill some time that way. Or maybe I'll just sit here and listen to some music until they get here.",4.166666667
I would feel some sort of irritation towards my friend. I would call them first to see how long they were going to be. If they weren't going to be too long then I would wait outside the party for them to arrive so we could go in together. If they were going to be longer then I would have to decide whether to go home or stay at the party. If I really didn't want to be there then I would go home and tell my friend that they should have been on time. If the party seemed nice then I might go inside and introduce myself to some people before my friend arrived.,3
"I would feel horrible that my friend was not there. The first thing I would do is try to get her on her cell, to find out where the heck she is. If there was no answer, than I would wait outside for another 15 minutes, if she had not arrived, than I would leave. At this point I would hope that nothing had happened to her, I might swig by her place to see if she was ok. If I was able to reach her by phone, than I would find out how much longer she would be to determine if I'm just going to wait on her, or go inside the party and meet up with her later.",2.333333333
"What I would do, is after about fifteen or twenty minutes of waiting for my friend to arrive, I would go into the party. I would ask to speak with the host. I would introduce myself and explain the situation, and ask if my friend had made it, or if they had reached out and contacted the host about attending the party. If it seemed comfortable and I interacted well with the host, I would walk around and explore the house. I would talk to people that were there. I would eat the food. Since it was pretty late, I probably wouldn't stay long. I would also try to reach my friend by phone and check for them outside again.",2.5
"since she invited me ill go even if I did not know the host or the people at the party. Ill will wait for my friend until she arrives at the place. Till that time I will spend time by playing games in my mobile since I have a interesting games and it will be leisure tospend time in that. And also I have e-books in my mobile so that I can read book like twilight series, how I met my girlfriend, hally met sally and so on. And will ak my friend how long it will take to reach there. And will also try to find any people who I know in that crowd.",4
Because my friend coming late and I am not know about the host and I am not much familiar with crowd I also not talk much so this is this very bad situation to me because I am very quite and not much talking person so I was call my friend still he is take time to coming so I take some time to talk to people so I try to talk party people. And feel comfortable with the crowd so I was take some drink and water for time pass.,2.5
I would walk around the room and get a impression of the vibe. Then I would introduce myself to someone who looked interesting and ask if they knew the friend that I was waiting for. I would try to make small talk and perhaps get a drink and some food while waiting for my friend to arrive at the house party. I would also maybe check my emails and text messages on my phone to make sure my friend was still coming and wasn't delayed or held up too long. And I would try and have fun or at least be entertained until they had the opportunity to arrive at the house party.,4
"I would wait out front for my friend to arrive. I wouldn't want to enter not knowing the host. I would probably stand around for 15 minutes and then if I saw someone I knew, I would go in but wait close to the front door. I would keep on the watch for my friend as I introduced myself to people. I would meet the host and explain who I was and who I was waiting for. If my friend was really late, I would be calling to see how long she would be. I would see if there was a problem. I would mingle as the time went on.",3.833333333
"I imagine that I would feel very apprehensive initially. I would likely find a place to sit and wait for my friend. Personally I like to people watch, so that is what I would do while I waited for my friend. Talking to people that I don't know can be intimidating. I would make an attempt to keep the conversation going as long as the other person was willing. I'm still learning how to hold a good conversation, but there are a few things I've noticed. Talking about experiences is one of the best ways to keep the ball rolling. My goal would be to keep the conversation going as long as possible while I wait for my friend to arrive.",3.333333333
"I'm not very fond of going to situations where I don't know anybody. I would be every uncomfortable in this situation. What would most likely happen would be that I would get to the party and text my friend from the car. When my friend would say they're not there yet, I would just wait in my car until they got there so we could go into the party together. If I didn't have the option of a car to wait in, then I would go into the party and just look for food or a place to sit until my friend arrived. I doubt I'd be doing much talking to other people unless I was getting wasted.",1.416666667
"I would be a bit uncomfortable and maybe a bit annoyed, but I would wait outside and give her some time to arrive. Things happen that could make her a bit late, but I would probably wait about 10 minutes before I tried to contact her. I don't think I would go in just yet, but I would try to say hello to those who maybe arriving while I waited for my friend, just introduce myself so not to feel so awkward when we do go in to the party. She would hopefully answer the phone and let me know what is going on, if not I think that I just might leave and not go in at all.",3.333333333
"My friend wants me to attend an important party to which I have never met the host, and are not very familiar with the crowd of people who will be in attendnce. Since I agrees to meet my friend at the party at 9 pm, I would expect my friend to sow up. I would feel irritated and alone if my frien did not show up. I woud call my friend and check to see what was going on. Depending on my mood, I may mingle and get to know other people since I'm already there. I'm sure my friend would show up sooner or later. I kow next time to show up late instead of on time when dealing with this friend.",4
"I would feel slightly anxious, but I would of course go into the party anyways. No point of waiting in the car when I am dressed and have a babysitter! I would talk to people, but of course I would check in with my friend to make sure that she was on her way. Once she arrived I would probably head either towards the entrance or greet her outside depending on the weather. If she ended up cancelling all together I would probably leave. I have enough friends and chatting it up at a party without a purpose is just emotionally draining.",4.166666667
"I would more than likely feel pretty irritated as I do not know anyone at the party. I would probably wait in my car as I would not just go in being my friend was the initial one invited and not me. I would call my friend to see where she is at and to see how late she is going to be. If she is going to be super late, I would go to a near by store or somewhere to waste time while I wait. If she is going to be extremely late I may just go back home.",4.5
"I would feel really nervous at first and I would definitely text her and ask her when she will be arriving. I'm pretty sure there may be a few adult words thrown into there as well- as I'm sure my nerves will cause me to say something utter goofy and profane. While waiting the 3 years it takes my friend to text back, I would try to talk to people at the party or see if I see anyone I might know even just a little. If there is no one there who I know, I would talk to the guests at the party. When they ask who I am or who invited me- I would tell them about how my friend invited me here, will be arriving late and have made me very uncomfort- hey where's the bathroom?",3
"I would feel very awkward. I do not like going to parties where I do not know anyone or only know one or two people. I do not to well in crowds and feel very awkward talking to people I do not know well. I would probably try to make small talk with one or two people, unless there was a pet at the house. Then I would probably just hang out with the pet and keep it company while I wait for my friend to show up. I would more than likely be annoyed because anyone who is my friend would know how much I hate scenarios like this and how weird it makes me feel.",2.75
"I would feel incredibly uncomfortable at that point. I'd introduce myself and state that who I'm meeting there. Once told that they aren't there yet, I'd most likely go outside to wait if the weather is nice or if it's not nice, I'd find a couch or sitting area that I could wait at without really interacting with many people. I'd be looking to fade into the background until my friend arrived. I'd text her to see how long she's going to be too since that does make a difference as to what I do.",2.75
"I might sit in my car at first and call or text my friend on my cell phone. If they are pretty close to being there I will wait in my car, hang out, and work the New York Times Crossword on my phone app. If it will be more than 25 to 30 minutes then I will head on in to see what's going on at the party. I will head to the snack and drink area to have something to hold in my hands and not feel so out of place. I will try to speak with anyone who seems willing. If I can't find anyone to talk with I will check out the art or photos on the walls of the place.",2.333333333
"I would completely understand if my friend was late. I would contact my friend and ask them if they could give me an estimated arrival time. I would then go inside and check out the party. I would look around and smile at people. I would try to find a drink and just mingle with the crowd. I do not have a problem attending a party with a crowd of people, in which I know no one there. I am a people watcher, you could say. I love talking to strangers. People interest me a great deal. I would also try to find a place to sit, because I'm sure my feet will be hurting.",3.666666667
I would wait quietly for my friend to show up. I would introduce myself to everyone by letting them know who my friend is and I would just hang about and listen to other people speak. I would take a beverage only if it was offered to me but I would wait for my friend to show up before drinking or eating any more. I would just wait calmly and eventually get to know everyone and accept you in the party as a guest. When she finally arrives we she introduced me again but her friends say he already introduced himself while he waited for you.,2.833333333
"First I do not know that party hall, after long searching I reached that place at 8. 45 pm. So I waited for my friend since she said 9 pm. But my friend is not came even the time is 9 pm, 9. 15. 9. 20 pm going. Time is going. I really nerved because of this late. Some times I sitting on chair, some times I standing at out side and some times I searching at parking area also. What is happening for her and I trying her phone no, but not reachable. Again I tried and rings are go only. Again I waited for another 1 hour for her arrival. Since I want to meet her.",3.083333333
I would feel a little awkward and out of place but sometimes you need to take one for the team. I would congregate around the food or a wall. I would seek out fellow wall flowers and strike up conversations with them and use my situation of being an early bird at a party where I literally know noone as a starter. Hopefully people like my charm and start to talk back. With any luck my friend does not stand me up to a party she or he invited me to.,3.75
"I would feel bad, I usually don't like crowded places. But I do love to spend my time with my friends, so, I would sit and wait and or or search for food because why not. Then, in this meantime, I'd call him or her and ask how long it will take, if it's ok for me to hanging out around the party alone etc. Sometimes, people try to interact with me, and I try to be as kind and attentive as possible. I'd keep waiting until my friend safely arrives, so I can enjoy the party at it's fullest!",2.666666667
I would feel anxious around a lot of new people and I might be a little upset my friend was running late and I was there alone not knowing anyone. I would introduce myself around for a bit. I would probably try to have a conversation with some people. I would also have a refreshment. I might use the restroom so when my friend arrives I can just spend time with them. I might see if a game or something was going on and join in to ease my nerves a bit and give me something to talk about with the people at the party.,3.083333333
"I would probably wait for my friend to come. I would leave the party and go to a local store or take our restaurant to kill time until they showed up. I would continue to text them and ask when they are close so that I could meet them and attend the party. I would generally stick to my friend and not leave their side as I do not know anyone and would be nervous, shy about interacting with strangers. I would try to drink more to feel more comfortable in order to loosen up and try to socialize more.",1.666666667
"I would wait outside in my car until my friend arrives. If the time begins to past even more I would call her to see how much longer she will be. I would let her know that I was sitting in my car and for her to contact me once she arrives. Until she arrives I would scroll through my phone on social media. After doing that for a while, I would play some games all while keeping up with the time. If she still haven't arrived I would make a phone call to a friend to talk about how she has me waiting on her at a party where I don't know a soul.",3.166666667
I would be very anxious about this situation. I would text my friend and see where they were and how late they were going to be. I would almost certainly wait outside of the party until my friend got there. I don't think I would try to insert myself into the party without an invitation and without my friend being there to get me in. I would want to be as low key as possible and not draw attention to myself. I would be annoyed that my friend invited me and then was late as well.,3.666666667
"I think that if I arrived before my friend did, I would sit in my car and wait until they showed up. If I was already AT the party and my friend wasn't, I would likely seek out the host and introduce myself and quickly note our connection to mutual friend. I would ask the host if there were anything I could do to help with the party and offer my services. I would likely try to socialize until my friend arrived. I would also make a mental note in the future to arrive a bit later than my friend in the future.",2.416666667
"I would turn around and go back to my car and wait for my friend to arrive. These are people that have invited HER or HIM, and I don't want anyone to think I am crashing the party. I also do not want to struggle to make small talk with people that I don't know. It is nice to meet new people, but I don't feel comfortable if my friend is not with me. While I am waiting in my car, I will text or call my friend to find out when they will be arriving. I will say that I am not going inside until I know they have arrived. I would ask my friend to give me a call as soon as possible. Then I would sit and wait for my friend's response.",3.5
At first I will try to contact her through my cellphone and tell her that I have been waiting there for a long time. And tell her to arrive at the place as soon as possible. Because the rest of the people are unfamiliar to me. I can do nothing without her presence. So I am desperately in need of her help through her presence in the party. If she is not available I would try to bring her to the place as soon as possible by going in search of her.,4
First I would be pissed off and I am sending a text to them straight away saying you got 20 minutes if you are not here I am leaving. Next I am going to mingle and start speaking to and introducing myself to some people that seem friendly. I will also make it a point to get some drinks as well and some snacks or whatever there is to munch on. If I find the conversation dull or boring or there is no one really worth speaking to after the 20 minutes if my friend has not arrived I will leave.,4.833333333
"I would be horrified that my friend is late and I don't know anyone. I'd probably get myself a drink from the bar and text my friend to find out where they are. If there's no bar, I'd head to the ladies room to call her from there. I may even make my way outside to my car to hang out and wait. Anything to not be in the awkward situation of not knowing people and having to make small talk. Those situations are the worst when everyone else knows each other and they're hanging out in groups.",3.833333333
"If I knew they were late before going into the party I would most likely kill time outside and wait for them there. If I was unsure about how well my friend knew the people I would not want to go in and just be the friend of a friend that sits in the corner. If I didn't know they were late and I had walked in to the party and then noticed, I would work to introduce myself to the host and say hi to a couple people and work to be sociable so I didn't seem like my friend invited someone who was off.",1.833333333
"I would immediately feel anxious. But I like to force myself out of that mindset so I would make a lap at the party before taking any action. I would try to make eye contact with people and see if I could get any conversation going. If my friend was more than 45 minutes late, I would step outside and call them to see when they were getting to the party. Depending on their answer and the vibe I got while scoping the party out by myself, I might leave or I might stay if the people where nice there.",3.416666667
"At first I'm sure I'd feel a little awkward with a group of people I'd never met before. I guess I'd start by wandering around the party a bit, getting a sense of the scenery, perhaps getting some food. I'd maybe check my phone notifications, act casual and let my presence become more familiar to those around me. After waiting for a few minutes, I'd probably just go up to someone new and initiate a conversation with them. In a party environment I've never found it particularly difficult to do so!",4.666666667
"I would be slightly irritated first at my friend. I do her a favor and she leaves me high and dry even though she knows that I am not comfortable in those social situations. However, I would not let it get to me because the people I am meeting have no idea that this is a fact. I would take a glass of wine and try to mingle with people who seem easy to talk to. I can easily read people in social situations so I would go towards the people that seem easy to talk to. I would tell myself that I am never doing her a favor ever again.",3.666666667
"I would be extremely self conscious and irritated with my friend. I would try to text her to see where she was. If she did not respond, I would try to identify the host of the party. I would then introduce myself and make small talk. After a few minutes, I would go try to find either the food or the bar to waste some time before she arrives. If she never shows up, I would leave after about half an hour. I would be extremely aggravated with her and question our friendship if she never gave me a good explanation as to why she did not show up.",3.416666667
"I would feel very awkward and I would immediately try calling my friend. I would hesitate to go inside. But I think if my friend is taking too long to arrive, I might as well go in and see what the party is like. If it looks friendly, I would try to blend in and check out the surroundings. I might try to talk to someone who is on their own or looks friendly. I might introduce myself to the host and inform about my friend. If I feel too awkward I might use my phone, maybe call someone or use some app. But I am sure I can strike up conversations with people and find somethings interesting and try to socialise. I would still be asking my friend to hurry up though as I not a big fan of going into an unknown crowd.",3.5
"I would be really peeved and frustrated with my friend. How rude h or she is for inviting me then being late when h or she knows I don't know anyone! I would try to make small talk with some of the people who seem also to not know anyone to talk to. If they're unfriendly, I'd talk to some of the staff, such as the bartender. As I wait, I would probably also play on my phone to pass the time. I would also contact my friend to figure out what the deal is and why they are late. I would probably not wait long. If h or she doesn't show up after 10 to 15 minutes, I would just leave.",3.75
If it is possible to leave without being noticed or seeming too awkward would probably wait outside while trying to contact my friend to see where they where and when they might be arriving. If not possible to leave would try and find a quiet spot to make a call or text to my friend. While waiting would then move about the room to see what there was eat or drink and what entertainment there might be. Finally if still waiting I would then find a drink and somewhat quiet spot to hang out while waiting.,2.333333333
I would feel a little anxious while looking for my friend or checking to see if I know anyone. I would call my friend to see where she was and when she would arrive. I would find the host and introduce myself and let her know that I am a friend of someone that invited you. I would as where I can put my coat and also ask if there is something I could help with while waiting for my friend to arrive. If there was nothing for me to do I would ask to be introduced to a few people to be able to start a conversation which would make me feel more at ease if I find something in common with a few of them. I would hope to make a few friends at the party as I like to spend time with my friends. When my friend arrives I would introduce her to the new people that I have met and connected with.,4.75
"It would feel awkward to be there knowing that I don't know any of these people. I would ask the first person after greeting them and introducing myself as my friends friend,if they have seen them. If they said,yes,I would still make some small talk then go directly over to where my friend is. If they said no, I would find a drink station or a bar,get a drink and keep an eye on the entrance until my friend arrives all the while texting them as to where they are and when they would get there. I would try and pass the time by saying hello to as many who come by to get a drink just to ease feeling out of place.",3.583333333
"I would feel anxious and be in a state of panic. I wouldn't enter the party without my friend. I would park my car and wait, but while I waited, my face would flush and grow hot. I would likely break out in a nervous sweat, coupled with a thready pulse. A situation such as this would require me to take my medication, and I would be unable to move on my on to a party where I wasn't personally invited by the host. My heart would race and I would feel the strain and pressure in my chest. I would only be able to wait a few minutes before the sensations become too intense to drive. If, say, after ten minutes, my friend still hadn't arrived, I would text them to let them know about my panic attack and that I had to leave the area. I would inist they text me once they had arrived, and if they weren't coming soon, that I would be leaving.",1.333333333
"I would hang out and wait for my friend. I would circle the room looking like I fit in while feeling super awkward about the whole thing. I would grab a drink, maybe some snacks and worse case I would head for the restroom. If my friend was too late I would honestly ditch them and go home. I wouldn't attempt to speak to anyone of do anything like that. I would keep to myself as much as possible and try to blend in. It would be hard fitting in. This is weird.",2.583333333
I am maybe a quick walk thru. I am calling my friend and see what the hold up is. Walk around and find a beverage. I am looking for the food table for sure. Maybe do a little mingling. Try and find the host and wish them congrads and or goodluck. Lots of small talk. If my friend is not going to show up I probalyy would say my quick hello and goodbyes. If she is just running late I am going to try and have fun. You never know the party could be really fun.,3.666666667
"I would feel fine. I would introduce myself to the host and let them know I am someones friend and they are on the way. I would probably sit back and observe my environment before engaging in conversations. Once getting a good feel of the room, I would seek out to have conversations with various people. I would not be nervous or anxious because any friend of my friend, is my friend too. I would engage in conversations and probably ask how they know my friend to show a mutual connection.",4.583333333
"I would go inside and introduce myself and explain that I am waiting on my friend to arrive. I would make small talk and probably help myself to a drink or some appetizers if available. I would feel out of place at first since I don't know anyone there, but I'm not shy so I could join in the conversations around me. I would find the host and explain that I was invited by a mutual friend and that she was running late. I would find out how the host knows my friend and ask about what they do for a living and their family.",3.333333333
"I would fell a little angry at first since I was joining my friend at the party and expecting to walk in at the same time. I would make a mental note to in the future meet up somewhere else prior to an event and then go to the event together. Most likely I would've texted my friend prior to leaving my car or if I had Uber'd prior to arriving. If I had taken an Uber, I would still go up to the door, ring the doorbell, and announce to the host that I am attending the party and waiting for our mutual friend. I actually enjoy social situations, so this will give me a chance to case out the place and the people to see if I will stay for a long time or just long enough for my friend's satisfaction.",4
"When I arrived at the party and could not find my friends vehicle, I would first of all text them and let them know I had made it there. I would however sit in my car for about another ten minutes giving my friend time to get there in case he or she was stuck in traffic or just running late. Once ten minutes had passed I would get on the phone and call my friend to make sure first of all he or she was ok and if they are ok I would ask there estimated time of arrival. If it was going to be longer than ten or fifteen minutes, I would actually drive around or go sit in a lighted parking lot until it was time for my friend to be there. I would not go in to a part where I was not the original person invited nor would I walk into a party where I didn't know anyone.",1.666666667
"If my friend was late I would feel a bit shy at first but catch on and get to know different people at the party. I would grab some drinks or food and try to talk to others. With me being very social, this is a perfect time to find new friends and find new hobbies to do with friends. I feel that my friend not being their isn't the end of the world! If I cannot find anyone to talk to, I would just act like I'm having a good time and look around at others gazing and studying them.",2.916666667
"I am extremely shy and I have social anxiety. I would not go to the house until my friend arrived. I would call my friend and ask where they are and how long it will be. I am the kind of person where in reality I would have gotten a ride with my friend to the party, or even declined the invitation. I do not do well in these types of social situations. I would like to think I would be brave enough to go to the door and introduce myself but I know I would not do that. I would just wait.",3.083333333
This will be a very frustrating situations for me. I will be angry to my friends due to his late. And I will promise myself to avoid this friends words in future. I will wait for another few minutes for my friends. And if not come I will left that party immediately without any information to anyone. Then I spoke to my friends over telephone to know the reason for his absent in the party. If reason is valid then it will be okay. Otherwise I will have no faith with that friends in future One thing I can ask to my friends for his absent minded pschycology. And I will be very angry with him.,3.083333333
I would think: Oh no! I knew we should have met before coming here. We should have met for a drink somewhere else and then come here together. I hope she's not going to be too late. Oh well. And then I would walk around the party trying to see if there would not be someone I know by any chance. I would get a drink and try to strike a conversation with people who look welcoming. I would probably try to find the host or hostess of the party and chat with them a bit. Some parties are pretty welcoming and people are willing to connect with pretty much everyone. Other parties are harder because the people in attendance just want to hang out with their friends and will not make the effort of talking with strangers. But I find that in most cases it's relatively easy to start talking with people you don't know at parties and get a good conversation going.,4.833333333
I be worried he got hurt I try contacting him and finding out why he running late. Then I if I can't get in touch with him call his other friends and see if anyone heard from him. Cause I will think something bad happen to him cause he never done this to me before he always been on time. But I make sure to still have fun on his behalf drink but not get drunk and keep my phone close by in case he deciced to call or text me. I would mingle with some women and see who all at the party.,3.416666667
"Well, something very similar happened to me with my friend Daniel 4 years ago when we worked together. Daniel invited me to a university party with the exact time of 9 in the morning. The party was close to my house, so it didn't take me long to get there. I prepared for the party, I dressed well, I scented and arrived at the agreed time. I waited for my friend Daniel sitting in my car, but Daniel was delaying every time he called his personal cell phone. Daniel finally arrived 46 minutes late and this put me in a very bad mood.",3
