"I would feel fairly awkward and embarrassed about this situation because I don't know anyone at the party. I wouldn't be mad or anything like that because it's reasonable that my friend would be late to a social gathering like a party. It's not like this is an important business meeting where something important is on the line like my financial future or even my career. Regardless, it would be an unexpected surprise that I normally wouldn't want to be in. I would probably try to interact with some of the people and try to get to know them. It would be especially awkward if at a party I didn't talk to anyone at all.",4.333333333
"Well once I have arrived and noticed that they were not around, I would call them on my cell phone to find out how lat they are going to be. And if they were going to be more then 10 minutes. I would then go inside where I would introduce myself to them, and letting them know that my friend is running late and thank them for having me. I would then search out the bar for a drink and then start mingling and looking where to go to have some fun until my friend showed up.",4.666666667
"If I agreed to meet my friend at a party and when I arrived, my friend was not there I would back out of the party politely and call my friend. I am there for my friend so if that friend cannot arrive on time or is being held up by some unforeseen circumstance I would need to find this out. In finding out what is going on I could then decide my course of action. I would then either leave or settle in and wait for my friend to show up. If I needed to wait I would begin making acquaintances at the party.",3.666666667
"I would probably feel annoyed that my friend was late. I would probably call them and figure out how long they would be and then wait in the car until they arrived. I know that's awkward but if I didn't know the host or if I weren't familiar with the crowd of people around I definitely wouldn't want to feel like I was intruding until I was with the person with whom I was supposed to attend. I would feel really frustrated. I'm already someone who hates people who are late. It communicates a lack of respect for my time, and for this to be something I'm not even supposed to be at I think would make me more upset.",2.583333333
"I would try not to worry about the friend being late and wait five or ten minutes for him to show up, before calling him. If he's on his way, I would just wait for him to show up. If I can't get ahold of him, then I would wait for another ten minutes, then decide whether I want to go inside or not. If I get a good feeling, I would go inside, find the host and explain to him that I am my friend's guest. Then I would see how the host would react. If he invites me to stay, then I would for another 20 minutes before calling my friend back. If I feel comfortable, then I'll stay for a while and enjoy the party. Otherwise, I would leave and catch up with my friend later.",2.833333333
"I would feel really weird. I wouldn't know anyone there, and I would feel as though I wanted to just stay invisible. I would try my best to keep away from all humanity because I feel if someone saw me, they would want to speak to me. Normally, it wouldn't be such a huge deal, but this is an important party for my friend, and anything I do or say could be subject to making this person's life horrible in some way. I would not want to mess any opportunities up for my friend. I would kind of be a paranoia of avoiding so I would be so weird to anyone as it is. I would definitely be mad too at my friend for leaving me in such a situation.",3
"I would be pretty angry that my friend did not meet me on time at the place I have never been to before. I would be standing around feeling kind of stupid as a bunch of strangers looked at me like I was lost. I would be on my phone texting my friend and then trying to call them trying to figure out what was going on and how long they would be before they actually showed up. Once I found out where my friend was, I would probably go into the party to grab a drink and say hello to a few people and let them know that my friend was on the way.",4.416666667
"I would be really uncomfortable no matter the circumstances. I am as reclusive as they come and I absolutely loathe being in crowded places for extended periods of time. You may as well torture me as force me to attend a party, especially one that is full of strangers. To say that I would be angry with this person would be an understatement. I would try to find the least crowded place possible and stay there until they arrived. If they were really late, they would most likely miss me because I would not hang around and wait for very long.",1.583333333
"I would feel a bit uneasy and nervous at first since I don't know anyone. My friend is the only point of contact I have and this is an important party for someone or something I don't know. I'm just here to support my friend, so I would wait outside until my friend come. I would just occupy myself on my phone while trying to find somewhere to hang out while waiting for my friend. I'm not sure I would try to approach or speak to anyone because I'm quite a reserved person and wouldn't have gone unless my friend really wanted me to be there.",3.416666667
"I would feel bored. I would feel like this is a waste of time. I would call my friend and see if they are okay first. I would be worried since this was their idea. I would want to be try to make sure if they are okay. If they aren't okay, I would go and make sure they are. If they aren't I would go and try to help them. If they just straight up left me, I would try to make the best of if. I would try to put in some effort. If it wasn't worth the time in the end, I would just go home and relax. I would try to make up the rest of my night.",3.75
"I would feel hugely irritated and uncomfortable. I would go outside to call my friend and find out why she was not there yet. I would probably leave and go somewhere until she notified me that she had arrived at the party. This is not my choice to be there and I have no obligation to stay. I would say that I have to run out for some reason and will return. When I return, it will only be with my friend. I do not have to mingle or be charming with a bunch of people I do not know. I am doing this as a favor and my kindness has been abused.",1.75
"I will call my friend and ask him how long would it take for him to come to the party, then I will wait outside until he comes if it's like 10 to 15 minutes if it's more like 30 to 45 minutes I will probably go to the party myself and find an empty space to sit or I will look around if I know someone at the party then I will try to talk to them until my friend arrives, then after like 30 to 45 mins I will call my friend again if he has not arrived yet to know how long it's going to take.",2.5
I would feel very shy and awkward being there by myself. I would stick near the food table or near an area where some people are hanging out quietly. I might just hype myself up with some motivational words and then go find someone I feel share the same interests as me. I would then go and talk to them as confidently as I could possibly do. I would text my friend to see when they are arriving and ask why they are taking so long. I would then ask them if they need me to pick them up or help them in any way.,3.916666667
I think I would feel very hurt and disgusted by the situation. I mean we are friends for a reason I would suspect that there would be some level of respect on both parts for me and my time. I don't think this something that I would let slide nnot even for a little bit. It is something that I would have to talk to them about sooner than later to be honest with you. I dontthink this kind of behavior should be tolrerated at all. I hope they have a very good reason as to why to do this.,2.583333333
"I would be really irritated given that I don't know the host. I might leave the party and wait for my friend in my car. If I didn't have a car there, I might try to find an inconspicuous corner, or someone I know to talk to. If I was feeling particularly brave, I might go find the host and introduce myself because it would feel just too weird to be there and avoid the host. I would feel like I was crashing the party. If I couldn't find the host or anyone I knew, I might end up giving up. I would obviously try to contact my friend before I left the party, but I don't really want to hang around strangers all night.",1.916666667
"I would feel uncomfortable about the situation arriving and he wasn't there already, I would certainly phone him right away and see what the hold up what. I would ask who is the host and try to introduce myself to them and whomever elses like they maybe of friendly nature. Considering I don't know any of the people I will be reluctant to reveal much more than public information about myself if necessary while speaking with any of the other guests. I would like to think I could find someone or a person of the opposite geneder to communicate with along the way but that is not for sure as I'm not the best with introductions so uncomfortable would be an issue with it.",2.5
I would feel OK waiting on my friend. If I did not know anybody I'd probably look around the house first. If I see some people that look interesting or are giving off a good energy I would approach them and start a conversation. Probably would introduce myself and then see if they are receptive to talking. If I feel the need I will explain that a friend that I am waiting for is late and that I am trying to meet some people while I wait. I have found that people are usually receptive if you are truthful and most people can understand this scenario and would try to make me feel welcomed.,4.5
I would immediately feel very uncomfortable if I arrived at the party before my friend did. I would wait outside until they arrived. I definitely wouldn't go into the building by myself without my friend. I would also be angry at her for being late and putting me in such an awkward and uncomfortable situation. I would regard her as uncaring and selfish. If she did not show up soon I would probably go home because I would be very frustrated waiting for her. I would make sure I told her how thoughtless she was being so she wouldn't do this again.,2.083333333
"I hate situations like this. I would feel very anxious, and not know who to talk to or where to go. In an ideal world, I would be waiting in my own car for my friend to get there. If I had to go in the party for whatever reason, I would find something to hold, like a drink, and try to stay in the background and on my phone, looking busy. I would also kind of be hoping that someone at the party would try and talk to me, so at least I don't look so out of place.",3.666666667
"I would feel really awkward at a place where I don't know the other people. I would look around and if I see someone attractive I would smile at them and hope they come over to talk with me. If I am standing alone then I would drink something or look at my phone, because I don't like to start a conversation and risk rejection- generally I will look at someone or smile, but I expect them to approach first and the most I will say to start a conversation is something like hey or hi. I would probably text my friend and let them know I'm at the party so they can update me about where they're at.",2.166666667
"I would show up dressed my best with an expensive bottle of wine for the host. I would introduce my self and explain that I was waiting on my friend that I was their plus one. I would mingle with the people and talk of my friend obviously they were running late for a reason and I try my best to make a great impression on everyone while sing my friends praiswes. I would however be worried about my friend I bbe worried that something happened to them or they would just be late, I have to sneak off to the bathroom and make a phone call to see what was holding them up.",4.75
"I would not be very interested or enthusiastic about attending the party, however I would do so because my friend wanted me to. I do not like to enter unfamiliar situations, especially when I don't have someone to be there with me. I would agree to meet my friend at 9 pm, but would not enter into the party until my friend arrived. I would feel aggravated, upset and on edge that they were not on time and put me in that position to potentially be there alone without someone I knew. I would want to wait in my car until they got there and we could attend together.",3.666666667
"I would feel awkward not knowing the host of the party. Honestly, I would probably wait outside and not go inside before my friend arrived at the party. I wouldn't want to feel like an outsider walking in on my own. I might even wait in my car until my friend got there, let alone just waiting outside. I wouldn't want to be seen and have people wondering who I was. While waiting for my friend I would probably be annoyed with my friend and would be calling him or her while waiting outside.",3.25
"If this would happen, I would be a little frustrated with my friend. I would also be excited about being able to make a first impression on my own without my friend's assistance. I would go to the door and introduce myself. I would explain that my friend had invited me to the party and see if the host would be okay with me attending and waiting for my friend arrived. While I waited for my friend, I would mingle with the guests at the party. I would introduce myself and strike up conversations with many different people. I would let myself have a good time and hope my friend shows up.",5
"I would feel incredibly awkward and uncomfortable in this situation. First of all, I would never enter the party without knowing for sure that my friend was there. If I did not know anyone else in the location, I would wait in my vehicle until my friend arrived or I could get ahold of them and confirm they were inside. I am quite uncomfortable in situations where I do not know any other people. If I had to go inside without my friend, I would make my way to the food or beverages and hopefully make a new friend because mine sucks.",3.166666667
"If I were invited to go to an unknown person's party and then stood up by that friend, I would go ahead and eat and drink whatever they have available for free since I would already be there, then I would leave. I would be very upset with my friend, especially with them knowing how much I dislike parties and strangers. I would call them up. And unless there was a medical or family emergency that kept them from showing up, I would probably tell them hoe I felt about what they did.",1.25
I would feel fine about the situation. There isn't a need to be nervous. It's a party and people are attending in order to have a good time. People are sometimes late. It happens. I would look for the host and introduce myself. I would explain the situation and hopefully the host would introduce me to a few other people. I would just try my best to have as good of a time as possible until my friend arrived. I'm sure the other guests at the party would be very welcoming and understanding of the situation my friend put me in.,4.833333333
"I would feel very uncomfortable because I strongly dislike parties and do not particularly feel secure when meeting new people for the first time. I would likely remain something of a wallflower unless someone at the party decided that they would take it upon themselves to speak to me and draw me into a conversation. If no one did that sort of thing, I strongly suspect I would text or call my friend and ask for an update about his or her status so that I would know what to do. If he or she is only a few minutes late, I would wait for them outside the party. If they are delayed by a longer time, I would go into the party and try my best to look occupied. I imagine I would text or play on my phone with some gusto.",2.416666667
"I would feel super embarrassed. I'm not one to crash a party, so I'd probably wait outside until my friend got there so we could enter together and she could introduce me to the person throwing the party. While waiting I would definitely be calling and texting that friend. If, for some reason, I was already inside before noticing my friend wasn't present, I'd do one of two things. I would first start searching the party for anyone I do know. If that wasn't successful, I'd try to be as inconspicuous as possible, without full on hiding. Might just go back outside though.",2.666666667
"I would probably panic because I hate being alone amonst a group of people I don't know, especially if I'm expected to be social. I would sit out in my car and check my phone to see if my friend had tried to contact me lately. If they hadn't, I would text or call them until I heard back. If they were no longer coming I would head home. If they were just running late, I'd sit in my car and wait till they showed up. If someone spotted me outside I'd probably pretend to be busy doing something, although if it became obvious I was just sitting there I'd probably leave.",1.916666667
"I would hang back near the entrance to the party and watch for my friend. I would pull out my cell phone and text him or her asking if she's okay and when s or he will arrive. I will look around at the other people and try to get a feel for the party, locate an exit, locate the bathroom, and figure out the food and drink situation. Since I was a volunteer medic non-firefighting member of a fire dept, I am very safety conscious and don't like being in big crowds unless I know there are at least two exits.",2.333333333
"This has actually happened to me several times. I would get some sort of drink probably alcohol, but not necessarily, and then attempt to make small talk with whoever I could find. If it were a slightly casual occasion, I would find someone wearing some type of sports insignia such as a baseball cap, and strike up a conversation with them. Most people are more than happy to talk about themselves when given the chance. Allow the conversation to dictate itself, and mill around making small talk until my friend showed up. If, after a reasonable amount of time, my friend had failed to show, I would probably leave to check on them, unless I was having a killer time. I met a long-term girlfriend this way when a friend no-showed for a party.",4.833333333
When my friend inviting me to the party I will do small research about the host and way of traveling and root map. I try to manage the situation by myself by keeping some distance from the crowd or else I ask the staff about waiting rooms or anyother staying rooms in the place. I ask to my friend regards his presence time there. In case it takes too long means I will try to get away from that place and spend time like making mobile conversation with my close ones to avoid loneliness and stress.,3.25
WELL FIRST THING IS I WOULD CONTACT MY BUDDY TO BE SURE HE IS GOING TO SHOW UP. WHILE I'M DOING THAT I WOULD TAKE THE TIME TO GET TO KNOW WAS OF THE GUEST AT THIS PARTY. I WOULD HAVE A BLESS TIME MEETING OTHERS AND JUST HOLDING A CHAT WITH SOME OF THEM SO I COULD GET TO KNOW THEM AND THEM TO KNOW ME. I wouldn't ALLOW JUST BECAUSE MY BUDDY didn't SHOW UP YET MAKE ME LEAVE. I'M THE TYPE THAT WOULD LIKE TO GET TO KNOW OTHERS.,3
I would feel incredibly awkward. I would probably panic and hide in a corner somewhere. I may find something to eat and stuff my face until my friend got there. I would avoid everyone like the plague. If anyone came up to me I would just politely say hello. I would only speak if I was spoken to. I would be incredibly angry at my friend for putting me in the situation that they put me in. When my friend got there I would probably make sure she knew I was angry. I would probably leave when they got there.,1
"I have just arrived at a party where I am supposed to meet a close friend. I do not know anyone there and am feeling very uncomfortable. Because this party is supposed to be extremely important for my friend, I decide to stay and wait for a while just in case my friend was just caught up in traffic. I get a cup of coffee and move around the crowd a bit trying to catch the tone of the party. As I moving around the room I catch bits and pieces of conversations going on and find that this is a group of highly educated people who work at a local university. I am able to start to relax somewhat in the atmosphere because I have been in the University atmosphere for several years myself in a different city. There is another woman there near my own age and we are both looking like fish out of water. I strike up a little small talk with her and find out that we have many things in common children, grandchildren, hobbies, etc. I spend a few more minutes and my friend who invited me finally shows up almost an hour late.",3
"At first, I would feel uncomfortable being at the party without people I know. I would make attempts to interact with others and engage in small-talk with others while waiting for my friend. I could see myself locating the area of the party where the snacks were and start munching on them to feel as if I am engaged and to keep me distracted. When not interacting with others at the party, I would probably call my friend on the phone or distract myself with an app on my phone until she arrived.",3.083333333
I will wait for my friend at the entrance and give him a call to ask where he reached. Then I will check whether I know anybody who started entering the hall. If by chance I got someone familiar I will enter the hall with them and inform my friend that I am in the hall. Then I will wait for my friend inside the hall and will start watching all decorations and all dresses people wear. I always smile to people who smile and respect people I will also watch dresses of children and. Dresses worn by bride and bridegroom.,3.5
"I would feel really irritated with her, I would stew in my anger. I dwell on things, especially things that upset me. And the longer the wait, the more I'd stew. I would especially be upset that she didn't even call me to tell me that she wasn't going to be there. I would most likely wait in my car since all the people at the party are perfect strangers to me. I think I would probably drive home angry if I had to wait more than 10 minutes and I would probably hold a grudge for a while since I have a hard time letting things go.",2.333333333
"I would be really irritated at my friend and would be concerned that she might not even show up. I would pace around in an isolated area and curse her out under my breath for a bit to let off steam. I would eventually suck it up and see if I could make an acquaintance or two. I'd start by looking for someone else who might be by themselves and ask if they know my friend. Somehow I assume that they probably would not. That being the case, I would ask to find the host. I would then introduce myself and ask if they knew when my friend would arrive.",1.916666667
"The first thing I would do is text my friend to let them know I was there and if they wanted me to go on in without them or wait for them outside. If my friend gave me the go ahead, I would walk inside and introduce myself to the host, explain who I am, who my friend is, and that said friend is running behind due to traffic or some other excuse that is out of their control, and strike up a conversation. I would encourage the host to share as much information about themselves as possible while I make mental notes of all of it. When my friend has arrived, I will share any relevant details and let them take the lead in socializing from here on out.",4.5
"Realizing my friend is late to the party, I'd feel absolute panic and complete dread. At first, I'd want to freeze. My chest would feel tight. My cheeks would turn red. I'd want to turn around and leave. Realizing I couldn't let my friend down, I'd just want to go hide in a corner, but no, that's impossible. I'd be very awkward with everyone. I'd search for a place to sit down away from everyone. I'd be hoping that no one would come talk to me. I would avoid eye contact with everyone. This is a situation that I'd like to be invisible in.",1.333333333
I would feel a little anxious since I don't know anybody at the party and my friend is not there. I would most likely look to see if there was a bar where I could get a drink and relax. If they still weren't there by the time that is finished then I would try to spark up some small talk with anyone that looked open and willing to talk. I would try my best to fit in and kill the time until my friend shows up. I don't think it would be all that awkward just hanging out at the party alone for a while.,4.25
"I would feel rather upset as I am not very good at social gatherings and I would be quite awkward in this situation. I'd either wait out the event until my friend arrived and then give home some dirty looks, or I'd just leave and not look back. I certainly wouldn't mingle and try to make friends with anyone, because I know better and I do not show up well when I am put on the spot like that. I would certainly take my friend to the side sometime after the party and give him a piece of my mind.",1.166666667
First I fell alone and upset with the not familiar people. I would see much of time to the watch that when my friend will arrive. I silently sit on the table and seeing here and there to the crowd of the people. At last I want to approach someone to talk and smile. I would go the people and talk something and introduce myself to enjoy the party. I am really talkative person so I will easily mingled to the any kind of people. After my friend come or not I want to enjoy the party and talk to the new people.,3.583333333
"I would feel uncomfortable, but I would call my friend to find out why she is not here, my friend explained to me that her car would not start up and she is waiting on a taxi. I ended going inside and I met the host who is giving the party. I explained to the host who I am, she offered me a drink, from there she introduced me to the other guess at the party. I started to relax and enjoy myself. I had a few drinks, at a little. I called my friend back to found out how long its going to take her to get here, my friend said she was 2 minutes away. I decided to go outside and meet her. While I was outside I decided to smoke a cigarette, and drink what I had in my hand. As I am waiting on my friend I can the music inside so I decide to dance to it.",4.5
"if I will attend the party on exact on time 9 pm and my friend does not come there at on time I will call him and I will sit in chair and I will call someone or watching movie, playing game, and I will call him every 10 minutes why are late in the party finding another friend or some of the people I can talk easily with strange person. It very easy for me and waiting for my friend I really very heat waiting, and when I stuck in this situation at that time I always playing games on my phone.",3.583333333
I would first feel anxious for going in the first place as I didn't know people or they werent familiar. When I arrive there and found out that my friend was late it would make me even more nervous. I would probably just look around to see if I knew anybody and basically stay to myself if I didn't. I would probably text my friend to make sure she was coming and to find out why she was late. Depending on if she was almost there or not coming I would probably just listen to the music and the crowd until I knew.,2
I will really angry with him. It was a difficult time for me to stay there. And mostly I have to call him and say please come as soon as possible. Untill I just sit back of the office and waiting for him. It is very uncomfortable position for me because I don't know anyone there. So I should wait for him. And I hope he will come quickly as soon as possible. Until I just browsing in my mobile and getting the time pass. It is very frustration time but I hope he will arrive soon. After sometime he not arrived means I will call to other friends and speaking with them for letting time pass.,3.333333333
"I would feel somewhat uneasy around this group of people I don't know, but I would attempt to mingle and ingratiate myself while waiting for my friend- I would look for a group of people or a person who is doing or talking about something which I am able to do or talk about, so that I would be able to identify at least one common interest with which to begin an initial conversation. I might look for somebody talking about working in the same field I work in, or sharing my hobbies, or I might talk to somebody hosting the party about my appreciation for the party, and maybe a shared interest in food, drink, and hospitality.",4.166666667
"I would enter the party cautiously and look for my friend, hoping not to run into a person who asks who I am. I would text my friend continuously until I get a response explaining her estimated time for arrival. I would head over to the area and get a drink, though I would be embarrassed since at this point I don't really belong, since my connection is not at party. I would try and find a spot in the room, and look around for someone I know to start up a conversation. If no one in room is recognizable, I would look at phone for news, social activity or mail.",4.333333333
"I would be kind of annoyed if my friend was late seeing how I did not know anyone there including the host of the party, but what I would do would be to walk around and start talking to people to get to know them and see also if I can find the host of the party and introduce myself and try to get to know them. My friend would have put me in a very uncomfortable awkward situation and I would have to try to find the easiest way out in order to enjoy myself at the party.",3.75
"I'd be worried about where my friend is and call em. Once, I get them on the phone I'd explain the situation. Then, I'd get some drinks once I know they are ok and relax. Once, I'm drinking I'll start making conversation with everyone around the room to get a feel for the party. I'll try to keep my self engaged with the party til my friend gets there and probably make some friends in the process. That will give me a better sense of comfort and allow me to true enjoy all the party has to offer.",3.416666667
I would go around and find people to talk to and mingle with the crowd and be nice to everyone and I would not try to panic and instead just ask my friend how long before they arrive and also I would be very unsure in a new place and thats how I feel and thats what I would do and also go and get drinks and try new things and maybe get on my phone for a little bit and play around and just wait what else for them to show up and arrive and try to be friendly.,3
"I would understand that my friend is running late and I would just mingle until they arrive. I would look for something to drink access the situation. I would be interested in introducing myself to the host. I would double check the party to see if there is actually anyone that I know at all. I might go outside and smoke a cigarette. Usually there are smokers outside at parties and it is a good way to break the ice in social gatherings like this. I would text my friend to see when they plan on arriving. If they do not show up within the hour, I may leave the party.",4.416666667
"When I would first arrive at the party, I would introduce myself to the host and explain who I was and explain my relationship with my friend, and reason for attending the party. After introducing myself, I would enter the party and check again for any sign of my friend. If I still could not locate them, I would also look for anyone else I may know. If I could not find anyone I knew, I would go around and check out the scene, and grab some refreshments, maybe a drink or snack. I then would look for situations where I could possibly enter a conversation without being to imposing, I would continue doing this until my friend arrived.",4.083333333
"I would feel a little upset, so I would stay standed in my position waiting for another few minutes, then I would try to make contact with my friend via sms, whatsapp or another social media, maybe call in his cellphone too, to know where is him, how long would take to his arrival and how long I would have to wait for him. I would stay looking for the people in party, waiting in the market place for him, maybe see or walk around the place to know or find some better place to wait, like a bar that I can wait more comfortable.",2.666666667
"I would feel a bit hurt. I would want my friend to be there. I would be upset that they were not on time. I would probably call them and see what is wrong. Maybe they are sick or not feeling well? It's possible. I would probably just stand around outside and wait for my friend to show up. I trust them and think they will show up eventually. Or they might call me. If they didn't show up for an hour or so, though, I would just leave. I would probably even go to their house and see what is wrong.",1.416666667
"At first I would have a moment of sheer panic. I would look around and see all the strange people, they would look so comfortable and having fun. Here I would be, standing around, not knowing anyone, wondering where my friend is and feeling scared. My heart would pound, thoughts would race through my mind. Eventually I would start into the party, and try to strike up conversation with someone who looks friendly. I would start talking and introduce myself and mention my friend being late. I would ask the person what he does for a living and if he knows my friend. Eventually I would start to feel much more calm and get into talking with more people. I would stop panicking and start enjoying the party, regardless of my friend not showing up yet.",2.583333333
I feel little nervous as I am not aware of any person in the party. I try to keep calm until my friend reaches the party. But will look into the situation and try to go to the host and introduce myself and will ask about my friend and try to make the situation as much cool as possible. If I get proper response from the host. I try to continue to spend my time with the host until my friend reach the party. I would also notice the person who came for the party and will try to search if there are any known face to get interact with them. I will try to manage the time until my friend reach the party.,3.916666667
"I would feel extremely weird if my friend showed up late, and I was there alone. I really would feel uncomfortable at first, especially not knowing anyone else there. I would probably try and find out from my friend how far away they were. If it was a very short amount of time, I would probably just hang out outside the house in front of the property. If he or she was not arriving shortly, I would convince myself to go in, thinking it was weirder to stand outside alone than to actually just go in and try to socialize.",3.5
"I would initially be a little irritated at my friend for being late to an event where I am doing them a favor by showing up. I would also not be terribly surprised about this, however, because people are always doing this kind of thing and I would get over it quickly. I would enter the party and get myself a drink while waiting for my friend. I would introduce myself to others at the party and make the best of the situation. I like to talk to many different people anyway and enjoy socializing so I don't think this would be a difficult issue for me.",4.5
"If I arrive and my friend is late I would feel irritated. My biggest pet peeve is people not showing up on time Regardless it's my friend or not. I cannot stand tardiness or people being late in general. I would then call my friend and ask them when wil they arrive. Hopefully their response will be 10 minutes max. If any later I would get flustered, frustrated and angry as I hate on waiting for people it's a sign of disrespect when people are late I'm my honest opinion If you don't respect my time you obviously don't respect me as a person.",3.583333333
I will reach the party hall where the people have gathered and try to see if there is any person I am familiar with and will start a conversation with him and will get introduced to other people from that person and will have some snakcs or drinks and will watch the programs if any going on and side by side I will look at the entrance for the coming of my friend and will make a call to him asking when he will come. I ff it take more time for him to reach I will ask him to call some other person who is also invited for the party he know and ask him to accompany me.,4.166666667
"I will text my friend and ask any of his friend is present there or any common friends. Will ask people about that friend. If that person is not available for me or if I am unable to find that person, I will be enjoying the party with drinks or any DJ happening around there. Will walk around there, meet guys over there. Will talk to them and try to know about them. Even I may get a chance for a date, who knows. Will try to enjoy the party will my friend come and will keep on updating him about hows going here. Will try to get him soon as possible.",3.583333333
First of all I will check whether the party is well organized as per the taste of my friend and check all the guests are well attended as this is a party of my friend and it is my responsible to take care and get in to action in his absence. In the mean time will try contact my friend to check everything is ok and his expected time of arrival so that I can manage the party and guest before myself get in to party mood. And in every few moments I will check the party is on full swing as per the plan and inform in detail to my friend.,1.083333333
I will wait for sometimes and I will call him. If he didn't pick the call I will wait for another 10 mins and I will call again. I will get angry and scold him badly and I will play the game in my mobile until he comes. Once he comes we will go for party. I will wait for sometimes and I will call him. If he didn't pick the call I will wait for another 10 mins and I will call again. I will get angry and scold him badly and I will play the game in my mobile until he comes. Once he comes we will go for party.,3.5
"I will call him and inform that I will be expecting his arrival soon, so that only he will try to come soon as I am there waiting for him. Will try to ask him about the people there and also about other ones who I can be with. Will try to mingle with people, get introduced and get to know them. If any of his friends are already there, will try to find to find them and talk to them on spot. If nothing is working, will enjoy the party, and move to social media and try to use my time on that. If I can found any one that I can move on, I would stick to them, talk to them and party with them. Will try for my luck to get a date.",4.166666667
"First of all I around the place and take my sheet and watch the party, I am realize my mistake that time. May be I will angry with that friend. Then I watch my mobile and play games and make a call my friends and family and colleague. I think my tomorrow works and future plans and my past thinks. I said thanks to my responsible friends and colleague. Then go to the eating area and I eat my foods for free and just sit calm in the chair. And see the friend and wish to congrates and leave that place.",3.5
"I would feel incredibly awkward. I hate parties where I don't know most of the people, and would feel even worse if I basically didn't know anyone. First I would call or text my friend and ask if they were coming. If they weren't coming I would probably just leave the party. If they were coming soon I would try to find someone that I knew at least a little bit, or find people who were talking about something I felt comfortable talking about and try to get involved in the conversation.",1.916666667
"I will call him to see where he is. I will also text him to tell him that I am pissed of that he didn't show up by now. I will look around for the bar or where there are serving drinks. I will get myself something to drink. While drinking I will look around the crowd to see if I spot any single, beautiful lady. If I see one, I go to her and start talking with her. If she is interested with me, I will continue talking with her. If she rejects me, I go back to bar and keep calling my late friend.",4
"I will attend the party and introduce myself to the host. Then I will try to chat with someone. Sometimes talking with stranger gives new experience. I like music also so it is easy for me to kill the time. I will talk about me and my friend to the host. So it will create a good relationship between us. We will talk about some interested topics like fashion,politics and business updates. It is sometimes actually good to be I some new situations and atmosphere. Then it will be easy for us to adapt any situation. I will plan if my friend arrive what are the things we should discuss.",3.166666667
I would feel really awkward if I looked around and did not see my friend anywhere. I would go get myself a drink and maybe walk around the party a bit after texting my friend to tell them that I am at the party before them. I would make the rounds with my drink and look for a group playing a game and try to ask if I could join in. Games are good ice breakers when you do not know the people so I think I could warm up quickly.,4.583333333
I would probably first call my friend and see what was going on and to try and see if he was close or far from me. I then would probably go and see what kind of food they had and maybe get a drink so I could relax. I would also try and make some small talk with some people so I wouldn't look strange or I would find a chair and sit in it and act like I am busy with my phone and play a game or two while I wait for my friend to arrive.,2.416666667
I would feel slightly uncomfortable not knowing anybody there. I would probably be using my phone to contact my friend and find out what the hold up is. I'm sure someone will introduce themselves to me and I will be engaged in social chit chat. I would try to get to know as many of the people as possible. I would of course explain to them my situation and my tardy friend. I do not think I would have much trouble blending into the crowd and even making some new friends. I have never had any problems when it comes to mingling.,4.083333333
The first thing I'd do is text my friend to see if they're alright. Then I'd find whoever's party it is and thank them for having me and introduce myself fully. I'd then make small talk and hope my friend shows up soon. I'm okay with being in situations like that but I don't like them. Hopefully the host and whoever I talk to is interesting. I'd also look for some food or drink just cause they might have some really good stuff there. I'm not big on small talk but I'm comfortable when I'm in a situation where I have to start a conversation.,3.916666667
"I hate when people are late, especially if those people made it seem like you coming to this party was extremely important to them. I would likely feel irritated and would probably text or call my friend to see why they were late. I would not enter the party without my friend. It would be awkward to just arrive as a total unknown with people I don't know. I would likely wait outside and browse the internet on my phone or play games while I waited. If my friend was unreachable and took more than 30 mins to arrive I'd probably just go home at that point.",3.75
"I would feel very uncomfortable because I do not like being alone in social gatherings. I would probably grab a drink or open my own if this was BYOB and stand away from the crowd trying to figure out who was the host. I would be looking to see if anyone is trying to catch my eye to start a conversation. If I find such person, I would chat with them to make sure I do not look like a weirdo standing alone in the back of the room and see if I can keep this conversation long enough for my friend to show up. If it doesn't go well I will excuse myself and go look for a bathroom to kill some time.",1.916666667
"I would feel a bit strange being at a party in which I do not know the host or the mutually known contactfriend. Upon arrival, once I realized my friend was not already in attendance, I would shoot them a quick call and text and try to figure out where they were at. Depending on there answer, I would then decide if it was worth it to stay or leave. If they were close, I would go ahead and wait a few more minutes for them to arrive. If they told me something came up, I would go ahead and leave at that point. Overall thought, I wouldn't feel too bad and know that things happen. I would be a little less likely to go out with this friend in the future though, depending on the circumstances.",2.333333333
I would feel very awkward and alone. I would try to find the alcohol and drink until I felt comfortable enough to socialize. I would also text my friend constantly until they arrived because using my phone in situations like this helps ease the tension. I would try to start conversations with others but I am not very comfortable doing this so the conversations may be awkward until I am through 3 or 4 whiskey drinks. When I am good and buzzed I would be fine talking to people I don't know and discussing their work and lives in details and adding to the conversation.,1.833333333
"I would feel uneasy and nervous and anxious. I would text my friend to try and find information on how long he or she would be. If it's a long time I might honestly leave. If it wasn't going to be that long I would hang around by the door, pretend to be on my phone, and keep to myself. I would feel really awkward and unsure what to do. I would be upset with my friend and already even more anxious so I might leave anyway because even once they arrive I wouldn't be enjoying myself.",3.083333333
I am running late to party the people will not care but most imporantly I don't care if I don't know you well I'm not trying my best to keep you entertained or focus on my life. Once I arrive I realize my buddy evan the whole reason I came to this dumb party isnt there. I am super angry with him. I try to scoialize with the party host but I really don't feel like it at all. I really believe that he should came on time and be ready for me at this party.,2.666666667
"I would feel a bit awkward but not completely out of place. I'm an introvert by nature but can mingle and meet new people just fine if needed. I would definitely start to mingle and have fun. I'd probably introduce myself as so and so's friend, and try to strike up conversations from there. I've found that it's a bit easier for me in those situations if I imagine it as a game where I score higher points the more people I strike up meaningful conversations with. If and when my friend did arrive I'd probably lightly berate them in a joking manner for showing up late, but definitely nothing too harsh.",3.166666667
"It would feel pretty awkward, but I would tell the hostess, I was waiting for my friend. I would then jump on my phone and call him. If he answered I would ask him to arrive as soon as possible, because I don't know anyone here and I feel out of place. I would tell him that I came because he asked me and it would have been nice for him to be on time. I woold probably just start idle conversation with the others or try to meet up with a member of the opposite sex and see if I could strike something up.",3.583333333
"I'd probably feel slightly uncomfortable and slightly out of place since I wouldn't know anyone there and may not have much in common with them. However, I would go throughout the party and address myself as that person's friend and find people that know them and just mingle with them and try to get to know them. I'd call my friend on my cellphone and find out where they are and see when they are coming. Then I'd just continue going around the party and talking with people and getting to know them.",3.583333333
"I would feel upset that the friend put me in this situation. Any friend of mine would know that I feel uncomfortable in crowds of people, especially crowds of people that I do not know. At one extreme, I might be very likely to wait outside for my friend, avoiding social contact all together. Assuming that this was not possible, I might introduce myself to a friendly face or two. Talk or  interaction would likely be limited. After introducing myself I may head over to get food, or feign using my phone to contact my friend or look otherwise occupied.",1.666666667
I would wait a few minutes more for my friend at the door. I would then call to see how far away they were. My friend is not usually late and I would be concerned. If my friend was running late and let me know I would go inside and get a drink. I would introduce myself to the first person I seen and ask them who the host was so I could introduce myself and let them know my friend will still be in attendence. I would not feel very apprehensive as I am used to work situations like this.,3.916666667
"I am sitting in my car until my friend gets there. I would be calling them and calling them. Or at least blowing up their phone with text messages. I don't know the person and they didn't invite me to the party so there is no way I could just walk into the house a pretend that I belong there. Once my friend got there and introduced me to people, I would be alright on my own. I love being the center of attention and am very good at talking to others. What throws me off here is the fact that I wasn't specifically invited to the party and would basically be crashing.",4
"I would probably wait in my car and feel embarrassed. I'm not a fan of social situations anyway so I wouldn't go in without my friend. I might text my friend and see where she was at and how much longer it would be, and otherwise try to stay inconspicuous and away from others' eyesight. I would be annoyed with my friend for not keeping me updated and letting me know sooner that she was running late. But ultimately I've forgive her. If she didn't show up at all I would leave after 20 to 30 minutes and go about my night with my feelings hurt.",1.333333333
"I would feel horribly uncomfortable. I would be very nervous, and probably desperately search around the room to see if I know anyone. If I don't, I would probably make a bee-line for the alcohol, and busy myself by making or choosing a drink. After that, I would probably just kind of awkwardly hang around, maybe look for a dog or something to give my attention and time to. I would probably head outside with my drink so I don't have to look or be looked at by people. If it seems to be taking my friend a long time to get there I would probably shoot them a text to see what their ETA is.",1.083333333
"I would feel extremely uncomfortable about the situation and try to figure out where I could wait it out in an inconspicuous place. I would want to go home instead of be there. To be honest, I'd likely leave and call my friend to let her know that I couldn't stay for the party. I'd feel very guilty but I think my anxiety would definitely take over and I'd go through fight or flight mode. I would apologize, because I would feel so bad about it. I would also hope my friend would forgive me and wouldn't be hurt by my actions.",2.083333333
"I would not go in if I did not see my friend's car there. I would never go into a party where I don't really know anyone. I am way too shy for that. So I would use my cell phone to call my friend, and see where they are. If they were on their way I would wait for them, and then go into the party. But if they are going to be a long time like longer than 20 min I would just go home, or find something else to do. If they totally blew me off then I certainly wouldn't make plans with them again. Unless they had a really good reason, like a family emergency.",1.333333333
I would feel that my friend is very inconsiderate putting me in this position. I would try to make the most of the situation by walking around the party to check out the setting. I would greet anyone that I might remotely know to potentially chat up and pass the time. I would probably check my phone quite a bit and text my friend for updates as where they are. I would feel a little awkward and uncomfortable being at a party where I don't really know anyone. I would probably scan the place and find other loners to chat up and ask them how they know the host.,3
"I really don't like parties so I would be reluctant to be at this party in the first place. I would feel very annoyed with my friend for being late to this party, because I'm only there to support her. I would try texting or calling her to find out how long she would be delayed. I would wait a little while and try to make the best of it. However, if I felt extremely uncomfortable and I was unable to get an answer from my friend about her likely arrival time, I would simply leave.",2.666666667
"I would feel a little left out, I would probably walk in by myself and try to introduce myself around. I'd make sure to try and get into the crowd but not be one that sticks out too much. See who is giving me a friendly forward appearance and see which person I might connect with even if briefly. See maybe if there is someone else there that I might recognize and know. Grab a drink, grab a might, try and mill around, maybe do some exploration to see how the place is and where the house looks like. Then head back out and maybe wait outside for my friend, text them to see their status and let them know where I am.",3.666666667
If I was in this situation I don't think it would really bother me. I would go inside. I would tell them who I was coming with. I would make friendly conversation with all of the people there. If I felt uncomfortable I would leave or go to my car and wait for my friend. I am a very friendly person and I usually don't have a hard time making friends with people. I will talk to anyone or anything. It really takes alot for me to feel out of place. I would not be mad at my friend. I would understand that things do happen and sometimes people do run late and that is okay. I would hope that if the situation was reversed my friend would be just as understanding.,4.416666667
"I would call my friend to see how long they were going to be, before they arrived. I would either go to a local public place and hang out there to my friends get over toward the party. Not knowing anyone at the party and not being directly invited, I would hang out somewhere I felt comfortable at until I can meet up with my friend. I would go have a drink and talk to someone at the bar or play on my phone for a while. If it go too later I would probably just head home for the night. I would probably be a little irritated at my friend if they took to long to show up.",4
First thing I would do is give my friend a phone call and ask them for an ETA. If it's only 2 to 3 minutes I would find a wall to lean against outside and wait for them to arrive. If she is going to be later I would head inside and grab a drink. Depending how far away they are I would grab them a drink and have it ready for them when they arrive. After finishing my drink if I am still waiting I would go to the bathroom and freshen up afterwards. At this point my friend should be here and I would go out and meet them. If they are still not there yet I would find something to eat and kill sometime that way. If they are not coming at all the second I become aware of this I would leave immediately.,2.75
"I would already feel anxious as I don't like going to parties. Much less parties of people I don't know. I would feel awkward being there alone. I would try to find a quiet corner to hide and wait for my friend to get there. If anyone talked to me I would talk to them and be friendly, but I wouldn't go out of my way to include myself in people's conversations. If there was a place to get refreshments or drinks then I would do that. I would get a drink and distance myself from the others until my friend arrived. Once he arrived I would jokingly berate him for being late and putting me in this awkward situation.",2.666666667
"Oh thats the worst. I am not a social person, social situations make me very anxious. I would not be happy at least at first. I would be really upset actually. Most of my friends would not do this to me, cause they know how much it bothers me. When it does happen it is awkward. So, I would be very worked up. I have been doing a lot to work on my shortcomings though, so I would buckle up, tell my demons to mind their own business, and probably go in and introduce myself. The only worse feeling than walking into a uncomfortable situation is to just be sitting outside by myself feel awkward as heck anyway.",1.416666667
"If I find that my friend is late, I will first meet the host and introduce myself. Then I will find a place alone, where I will have a drink and a cigerate to smoke. I will not enjoy the party well. I will simply watch people partying. May be I will try to find a girl which will try to meet when my friend reaahes the party. However, I will not try meeting other people around as it is very awkward for me. Only drinks, cigerate and waiting my friend are only thing which I could do in the party. What elese I could do.",1.75
I would feel slightly uneasy and nervous as I am at a party with a people I don't known. While I waited I would call my friend and find out a little more about the host and when they are planning to arrive. Then I would try and locate the host to say hello and introduce myself. I often find when I am in uncomfortable situations a stiff drink can help so I would try and get one. After a few drinks I would then begin to talk with people and make friends.,1.333333333
"I would probably try to call this friend. I would feel more comfortable waiting outside or in my car, especially being a woman and not knowing the crowd. I would not be too happy with the friend, although calling her would allow me to know the reason she was delayed. Maybe something came up with her at work or she had an emergency of some type. I would feel awkward waiting around in a situation with so many unknowns. As I stated, it would be safer to just stay in my car until she arrived. I would relay that to her.",2.916666667
"When I first realized my friend is late, I would feel a little panicked. However, I would try to regroup, text my friend, and then make myself feel comfortable at the party. I would make sure to relax and smile at the other party-goers, and I would probably search out the snack table! I would make sure to have a snack and possibly a drink, and just make my way around the party. I would visit with people who seem like they want to include me in conversation, and I would take in any interesting features of the room, and make sure to enjoy any live music there is at the party.",3.666666667
"I would go around the room getting to know multiple people. I would stay busy by introducing myself to everyone I could engage with. I could go to the kitchen and make myself a drink as well as some food waiting for my friend, it would kill some time. I would then call my friend and asked when they would be arriving. If they are unable to make it I would most likely make an early exit and go home for the evening. If they are just running a little late I would continue to socialize with people already at the party.",3.833333333
In this situation I would go ahead and enter the party. I would immediately say hello to as many people as I could. Anyone who I could make eye contact with. I would eventually tell someone that I had been invited by my friend and I was looking for them. I would ask if anyone had seen them. I would find someone to talk to. I would actually feel pretty comfortable in this situation until my friend arrived. Of course. I would have tried to call my friend after a little time had passed to make sure they were okay.,4.416666667
"Okay so I'm at a house and party with people I don't know. I think I would need to know more of the situation in order to properly answer. But this actually has happened to me. My boyfriend invited me to a halloween party, we just started dating too, and he was out with the host's boyfriend getting drinks and wasn't going to arrive for 20 mins, he told me to go inside. I did go inside and I met the host told her who I was and why I was there, the party didn't start yet so they were still setting up. I felt entirely awkward so I tried to make light conversation until my boyfriend showed up. I think if I had the choice though I would have waited in the car and kept calling and texting my friend until she shows up cause I don't want a bunch of awkward conversation like why are you here and all.",2.333333333
"I would immediately feel angry because if the event and my attendance were so important to my friend, why wouldn't they already be there waiting for me with bells on? I would enter, though, check my coat, probably make a beeline for the restroom, and text my friend. Depending on their response, I would then leave if they were going to be very late- along with sending a reprimand for not letting me know in advance, or if it was a small delay, I would fiddle with my make-up, find a place to get a drink, and park myself away from people, but not buried so I don't look completely closed off. I would check my email, peruse my surroundings, and make small talk with people near me until my friend arrived.",3.666666667
I would feel so awkward that I was there by myself. I would maybe figure out a way to bide my time a bit so I wasn't stuck there all alone and would make it seem like I was busy. Maybe pretend to be on a call or looking at text messages or texting someone. Something to keep myself busy. Or I guess I could go the opposite route and try to actually talk to someone. Maybe I would make a friend and could carry on a good conversation. Or it would go really badly and I wouldn't know what else to do because I would have think that it went horribly wrong.,3.333333333
"I would sit outside of the location where the party is. I would try to reach my friend on the phone to make sure I had the right address and to see what was taking them so long. I would not try to enter the party or explain to people unprovoked what was going on. If someone approached me and asked me any questions, I would immediately explain the situation to them. I would probably give my friend as much time as they needed as long as I could get them on the phone. If I could not get them on the phone, I would probably wait 30 minutes before I left without going inside the party.",2.5
"I'd see if there was somebody that would recognize my friend, based on what he or she said to me about her or his friends, so, I imagined, I would try to blend in, get some beverage, if at the moment I'm single, would try to find some girl to talk, flirt a little, checking on my friend by SMS to see whether he's close or not and then if the party is going fine, would wait my friend, and would redo this exercise every 20 minutes, if at some point wasn't worth it, I'd leave.",3.833333333
"I would probably be pretty upset about the fact that they showed up late to a party where they were the only person that I really knew there. I would call them and make sure they were alright, if they answered the phone. If I couldn't reach them, I'd keep trying to get in touch. I would try to make conversation with people that I'd already met and hang around them and hope that my friend shows up soon. If there was something to eat, I'd probably eat next. After 30 minutes to an hour if they still haven't showed up, it's time to start calling other people to see if they've heard from them.",2.583333333
I hate going to parties in the first place. I would feel like I do not want to be there. When I see that my friend is late I would feel sort of angry and let down. There is a good chance I would leave the party. If he is not there within an half an hour I would just leave the party and do not care if my friend shows up or not. I would get hold of him first and if he does not respond I am leaving the party.,1.333333333
I would feel upset that my friend isn't here yet. Though I am able to talk to strangers in reality I don't like being somewhere there isn't anyone I know like a big party. But I guess I would have to get over it. If I do it while I am at the store then I can do it at a party. I would try calling my friend to make sure I wasn't stood up and hopefully she would answer. Than I would probably call my husband and let him know what happened.,4.333333333
"I would be very uncomfortable in this situation, so much so, that I really don't need 100 words to describe what I would do. If I had already gone into the party, I would find an excuse to either slip out of the party or find the restroom, and I would first text, then call my friend to see if she was going to still make it. I would wait wherever I was, probably outside until he or she arrived. If I found out that he or she was not going to make it, or if after 20 to 30 minutes, I did not get a response from my friend, I would leave the friend a message that I was leaving and I would leave the party.",2.416666667
"If I hadn't already went inside the party, I would wait outside- whether it was in my car or in front of the house. If I had already entered the party, I would probably want to keep to myself and stay in a corner, away from the hustle and bustle of the party. However, if I was approached by another guest at the party of the host, I would introduce myself and tell them my friend had extended his or her invite to me. I would act polite and courteous and thank them for their hospitality. I would also try and text or phone my friend.",3.916666667
"I would feel a little annoyed that I was on time but my friend was late, even though they knew I was not familiar with the people at the party. I would try to contact my friend to see how much longer they were going to be and explain to them that I would wait til they arrive to go into the party. I would remind them that I am not familiar with the people there and that they were the one who invited me. I would feel a little worried and nervous while I waited for my friend to arrive.",1.833333333
"I would not be thrilled about going to this party. I would probably be regretting my decision to go even before I arrived to find out that my friend was late. I might wait in my car or outside if possible, and call my friend to find out how long it would be before he or she arrived. If I went into the party alone, not knowing the host, I would feel very awkward. However I would try to be friendly and polite. I would introduce myself and attempt to make conversation if anyone spoke to me. Otherwise I would probably keep to myself for the most part until my friend arrived.",1.25
"I wouldn't go into a party without my friend. I'd be in touch with him or her by text or phone. I cannot image walking in blind- thinking my friend was there and embarrassing myself like that! There is no reason for that to happen with modern technology. If anyone today did that, I'd question their intelligence or perhaps they like to schmooze with strangers! Seeing as I didn't want to go in the first place, I would definitely want to wait for my friend before walking in to the party. If my friend was going to be too long, I may just decide to go home. I'd certainly let my friend know that. I'm not too sociable these days. I enjoy quiet time at home with my dog. The more people I meet the more I like my dog.",2.75
"I would feel extremely uncomfortable. Once I realize they are late, I would immediately try to contact him or her either by phone call or text message. While I wait for my friend to arrive, I would probably try to avoid making contact with anyone there. I would likely grab a drink, maybe a snack if there is any food, and people watch, while occasionally using my phone to check social media and of course, to ask my friend how far away they are. I would also occasionally use the restroom in order to kill time and avoid talking to people I don't know.",1.833333333
"I would join the party, sit in a very reserved corner, get my cell phone and read news, play Tetris, check messages and open an app and then go back to the home screen. If my friend hasn't arrived yet, I would leave the party and stay in the car, on the street, waiting for him. When he arrived, we would go in together. In case it didn't arrive, I would leave. In that situation I would feel vulnerable, abandoned, anxious and shy. Furthermore, I would spend months in fear of accepting a new invitation from this friend and being abandoned again.",2.416666667
"I would feel very awkward, obviously. I would not go to the party, but I would stay outside instead and try to call or text or WhatsApp or tweet or Facebook or whatever my friend and find out where they are and how long before they will arrive to the party. I would just hang out outside and wait for them. Maybe stay in my car or at some nearby place and I would probably just read stuff on my phone, like about the corona virus or something and just chill basically.",2
"I would feel like a fish out of the water. When I'm in environments where I don't know people, I don't feel at all comfortable, I really don't know for sure what to do. I am not comfortable in this type of situation, but I also do not get to the point of being desperate or nervous, I just get a little lost, I would probably try to talk to someone, but generally I do not do very well in this type of conversation where I do not I know people.",2.5
"Goodness, I would be extremely irritated and out of place. If my friend is not there, I would not go in until they get there. A quick phone call or text to get an arrival time. It would make me grouchy that I didn't want to come anyway and now the friend who invited me isn't even here. I have a great deal of social anxiety so I feel like a duck out of water and really want to get back in my car and leave. However, just because my friend is rude and late doesn't necessitate me to follow the example.",1
I would feel awkward because now I don't know anyone and my friend is not there to introduce me to everyone else. Until my friend got there I would not want to socialize as much as I don't know these people at all. I probably would introduce myself to other people however I would not want to socialize too much. When my friend got there I would start to feel more comfortable. He could then introduce me to others. After that I would feel more comfortable. Otherwise I would feel like a party crasher and would not feel like I fit in.,3.666666667
"If I arrived at the party and my friend was late, I would call my friend to get an eta. If I receive no reply, I will attend the party for at least an hour before leaving. I would imagine that my friend would have a good reason for not showing up to the party and do all that I can to contact them. Making contact with my friend would be my main priority. I would be very worried. The party and being stood up would be the least of my concerns. If I need to contact family members, I would do so.",3.5
"If my friend was late, I would introduce myself to the host and let them know who I am. After that, I would just find the food or drink area and enjoy the party while I was waiting for my friend. I would also probably just roam around the area and admire the decor. If anyone would end up talking to me, I would be friendly and say who I am and maybe small talk a little bit. If there was a television, I would check that out while I wait. I would probably also find a quiet area and be on my phone while I wait for my friend to arrive.",2.583333333
I would feel Very out of place at the function. At first I would likely just find a chair or corner somewhere and sit down and observe what's going on. After a While I would likely go to whatever setup they have for food and pick out something. I'd introduce myself to the first person I ran into while getting food and see if they knew my friend or not and if so start up a conversation. If they didn't I would probably just ask a few short questions about the host and go back to sitting down and probably call my friend. To figure out where they are. I really don't like social situations so it would be really uncomfortable not knowing anyone there.,1.416666667
"I am attend the stranger party in my friend in compel that situation. Am meet my friend in party at 9 pm in party. And my friend was come in the party at late, am feeling very saddened very fear at the time, and am was angry with my friend. And I am wait my friend I am agree to my friend in late situation on at the time. And not realize and relax my mind on this situation. My thought is very fear at the time in my situation.",3
I would question them as to what happened. I would tell them directly that they should have done better and arrived on time. I let them know what I think straight forward. I would tell them I didn't appreciate it at all and I hope that next time they do better. I wouldn't be to argumentative about it that long though. I can just go along with my friend and enjoy the rest of the night anyways. We'll forgive each other that is for sure. Things happen sometimes for a reason.,5
