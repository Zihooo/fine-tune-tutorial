I hereby agree than in the learning procces , you have to combine the experiences which are facts , with the knowledge which means ideas and concepts .
Since you are a kid , you start to learn facts , to ilustrate this , a crowling baby is going to know than crowl is usefull to touch things , to get what he desires , to experiment sensations or feelings , though the baby does not have enough develop of his body and mind to undestant the concept .
I meant learning fact is almost per se for your condition like human being , on the other hand , whereas ideas an concepts are the second step in the learning process .

According with the imformation above the students have to have the knowledges ( ideas - Concepts ) from books , from searches , from teachers , to know how to apply in the experience , nevertheless studies about education showed how the experimental learning is more effective than knowledges that you have in your mind but you dont know how to use them .

Despite the importance of theories , The experience that you life , you never are gonna forget it because is a bunch of feelings , thoughts , conclusions .
this argument support the idea about why the curricula have to be experimental , this way the student became his own teacher and the knowledge that he will get from books suppor his own experience .

To summarize , I belive the education is one of the most important value and award that you can obtein in your whole life , is why , if you are as lucky or fortunate to do it , filling your mind of ideas and concepts that day by day you are gonna life as facts .

8271,1287028.txt,P2,TUR,medium,"Time is the precious thing in people life but noone is aware of it end spend so generously .

Life energy begin in childhood and raised in youth ended in death .
Especially in youth ages everything is so simple for us ; .
we don t think about earning money or the job problems ...
We try to do our best to enjoy life as we can because we have energy to do this .
But when we get older we ll be scared to do something on our own and we ll delay our wills because there will be other persons in our life under our responsibility and their wills will be more important then ours .

I want to give example from my life .
I m 25 years old and i m living on my own in istanbul .
My family lives in other city and i want to study in america to be hired at reputable firm in istanbul .
I m about to change my life and i quit the job and take the risk because i know i m capable to do this because i don t have to lose at this age and i want to do everything i want in this ages after years and getting married this energy will not be only for me it will be for my husband children and work family ..
etc ..

Besides this emotional energy there will be lack of pyhisical ability in old ages to do things that we want .
Mostly old people use medicines for the deseases related to aging ; for example blood pressure ; could nt move faster and feel tired mostly .
It means when they feel healty and if there are some people araond them they enjoy their lives mostly

It is physical and emotional fact that young people enjoys their life more then older people because younger ones have great expectations from life and they have time to do .
I think we have to worth the time now we re in because it s go on so fast and we will not be young again .

5870,1014428.txt,P6,JPN,high,"Traveling is one of the good opportunities to get to know the outside world , so I strongly oppose to this statement .
I think we can discover new things more by traveling alone or with few friends or family .

Firstly , we can be flexible with our scedule when we travel ourselves .
This means we can pick places we want to go and arrange the most effective rout .
When I went to Spain with my son last month , we picked where we wanted to go first and organized our rout carefully .
We moved around using a subway and visited historical sites and museums .
Whenever we felt like changing our plan , we had a cup of coffe and made another plan .
For example , after we saw Gaudi 's famous Cathedral in Barcerona , my son wantted to visit other architectures of his , so we decided to see other buildings rather than go to Picaso museum .

Secondly , we can go where our interests are .
In Granada , we visited an old historical town called Albishin .
This town is located on the hill and it seemed to be very difficult for tour groups to go , as these roads are too narrow for large buses to drive and there are many passes to get out of the town .
If I were a tour guide , I might lose my customer as these roads are like a huge maze .
But when I think back our trip , this town was the most exciting and attractive place for us .
If we had gone to Spain in a group tour , we could not have visited this marvelous historical town .

For these reasos , I prefer traveling on my own or with few people .
We can go where we really want to go and enjoy what we really want to see .
The Spain trip with my son became one of the most memorable trips for me .

626,107269.txt,P7,DEU,high,"It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts .
I agree with the statement for the following reasons , the importance of the capability to think logically , solve problems and to create future visions .
The stated reasons are described in more detail in the following paragraphs .

First a students needs to learn how to think logically in order to understand a problem that needs to be solved .
Especially for study assignments as well as work assignments it is important to determine what is the unknown factor , that needs to be found .
If the students is not able to do that , the result might not be the factor that was initially asked for .

Second , if a student just learns facts instead of strategies to solve a proble the student will not be able to apply the already learned knowledge to a similar problem .
For instance the student knows how to calculate the revenue based on price per product times units sold but as soon as the units sold is unknown and the given numbers are the price for each product and the total revenue , the student will not be able to solve for the units sold .
In order to solve the outlined problem it is important that the student learns the strategy to solve a equation for different unknowns .

Third , only if a students understands the concept and idea of for instance a certain product like a car only then will the student be able to create further developments of the already existing features .
If the student only focuses on learning facts the student will always limit his knowledge and learing to already existing ideas .
Thus , the student will not be able to come up with future visions which are vital in somone 's accademical and professional carreer .

In conclusion , the ability of a student to think logically , solve problems and to create future visions or developments of existing knowledge or facts is more important to me than learning the facts .
It will enable the student to be sucessful in his or her study as well as professional career .

7322,1143655.txt,P3,JPN,low,"I strongly agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time for helping their communities .
On of the reason is that they do not have time to spend time on those things .
They must spend most of their time on studying in order to get good grade and go to well-known university .

Also young people nowadays are not good at comunicating with others and are hestate to meet new people .
It occures as people no longer talk with neibour as much as we did before .
There is one example in my community .
There was an opportunity visiting a house , which were for eldery people to live , in the communities .
It was an opportunity only for children but there were only two people attended .
The reason why rest did n't come was that they were afraid to meet and talk with new people .

The other reason is that young people nowadays are not intrested in helping communities .
School does not teach how important it is to help the communities and join the activities , they only teach things that the students need for exam .
Adult should encourage young people to give more time on helping communities .

9588,1547449.txt,P7,KOR,medium,"The understanding is the huge part of human ability .
The history of human is related with it very closely .
For example , the understanding of the value about a trading changed the whole structure of monetary system .
It is obiously true that having a correct understanding is the begining point when people do something .
Studying shold be started from a proper understanding about concept , because it indicates where students have to start the study and can be expressed the basic of learning .

Having a good concept can guide students where they are .
To understand is like a making basic structure of the building .
If some students realize the concept of the problems , he/she can start to solve the problems with the understanding .
If some one could not catch the concept , he/she will not solve the problems even if he/she is familiar with the problems .
Understanding a concept helps to the students directly where they have to start the problems for solving it .

Furthermore , it is a fundamental process in learning .
when teacher starts their teaching , they try to explain about the concept first since they consider that students are not able to handle a problem without the basic concept .
Altough they can get the fact directly , it will not helpful because students can not adjust the problems without concepts .

In summary , to get a concept is more useful and madatory process of learning .
by having a understanding about the problems , students will build their adjustbal ability and improve their studying skills .

8595,1353162.txt,P5,TEL,medium,"I agree to the statement that In twenty years tere will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
I can support my statement with few explainations or reasons and examples .
I strongly believe that people use cars as their means of journey instead of taains and buses .

I believe that people would prefer for personal , sophisticated and joyful journey .
All this is possible only by having personal cars .
Let me explain with a reasonable reason .
People work through out the day .
During weekends they feel to have ecstacy or euphoria to get relax from the enervatin jobs donre by them trough out the week .
So they may spend their leisure time with their parents or friends .

When it comes to spend time with friends or siblings than they surely prefer to hav long rides or long journeys .
So the best way is to have a personal car .
Because if an individual go for tain or bus as hios means of travelling than he or she has to wait for the train or bus until it comes and he or she can visit only those places where the bus or train can go .
He or she cannot enjoy the pleasure that the nature gives .

But when an individual has got a personal car than he or she can go to any beautiful corners of the nature .
There is one more advantage .
Whenever an individual gets exhausted through his journey than he can stop somewhere and relax for a while and can visit any mani restaurents nearby to have some stuff .
Is int advantageous ?
Ofcourse it is .
We can have lot of privacy in our own personal cars .

Finally one damn advantage by having a personal car is we can reach our destiny in time instead of wasting time in wating .
The destiny may be anything like office or a party etc .

So if we are a bit cautious in driving than personal cars are more advantageous and I conclude that in the coming years everybody prefer cars .

11318,1859110.txt,P6,ARA,medium,"Each person has his own way of traveling .
some people like traveling alone and others like to travel with a group .
It depends on the person 's personality .
But for both cases , a tour guide is needed specially if someone is traveling to a country for the first time .
In my opinion , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .

Being in a group while traveling is so important .
It is helpful and beneficial in many aspects .
One of these aspects , is to help get red of boar .
No doubt that loleness causes boaring to everyone .
So being in a group would solve this problem .
Another benefit is that peaple useually feel strang in other countreis because they miss their families , friends and people .
being in a group obviously helps reduce this feeling .
Finally , the last benefit of being in a group , is that you can find help from people you know if you needed help .
you can share your broblems with them instead of others that you do n't know in the forign country .

No doubt that the tour guide is very important and neccessary .
He can provide tourists with information they need about the forign country such as laws , rules and way of life in that country .
Moreover , he knows most of the places and how to get to them .
So for instance , if a traveler is looking for a restaurant , hotel or any other place , a tourist guide would be helpful .

In conclusion , it is advisable to be in a group led by a tour guide while traveling .
They can be really helpful and useful .
Also they can cause the trip to be more enjoyable and easier .

2022,348912.txt,P3,KOR,medium,"In the modern society , many things have change comparing to the past .
The Korean trdition for hleping other have dissapered but instead we developed a new way of helping our communities .
So I disagree with the opinion .
There are three reasons why I dissagree with the opinion .

First , the traditional way of helping others have changed into various types .
For example If you dial a certian number you can donate small amount of money or there was this event I went .
It 's the program to feel the starvation , uncomfortable house and all the pain that the children in the third world countries are giong through .
I donated some money and starve for 24hour .
By doing this I help a child to eat three month of nutritious meal .
so even though I did not visit a orphanage and did the cleanings and reading children stories I helped my community .

Second , the student have nowadays have to serve their community at least 20hours to go to high school or university .
Many people say that the true meaning of helping other is what comes out from your heart not the grades .
But because of this system I learn the joyful feeling of helping others .
After than I did more of the helping community more than the school required and I stared to get involved in many charity groups and jion unicef .

Third , Because of christianity , many students donate their money when they go to church and participate in activies to help the other in their community .
For example , my friend goes to church every weekend to give food for the homeless in park .
It is not only christianity that encourage helping others many kinds of realigion encourage students to serve the community .

Just because some traditions has chage it does n't mean that the young people do not give enough time to help the others .
So Because of these three reasons I disagree with the opinion .

8702,1370560.txt,P3,ARA,medium,"i strongly disagree with the statment which suggests that young people nowadys do not give enough time to help and aid their communities , because young people are currently much educated and oriented than other young people who lived in the past due to the advances in all fields of education , technology , social services and becuase of the emergence of the active social charities and communities all over the globe .

young people nowadays represent a major part of the community , and they are aware of how hard and difficult maintaining a good life can be , they are noticing how the crime level is escalating severly , and how there are an increase in the number of homeless children , and that a lot of people are not recieving good health services .

all of these mentioned examples will cause young people to be scared and force them to ask questions like :
- how might we survive through all this ?
- is what i am seing now will happen to me or to the people whom u love ?
- whats waiting us next ?

well , by asking all these questions , another one come in mind and that question is : `` what can i do to make this place a better one ? '' and the answer right away will be : '' act now '' . young people can do a lot of things , for instance they can participate in social activites , they can voulenteer in communities and charities which are directed to promote and encourage people life , others can enroll in programes that focus on environment preservations .

i truly believe that young people can and will be of great help , yet we must provide space for them express themselves , and provide them with all the means neccessary to ensure the integrity of their work because , sometimes the problem lies in us , that is adults in really understanding what young people can do , therefore we must quit the idea that these young cannot do any good , because they can .

6037,1029138.txt,P4,SPA,high,"I agree with the statement because , after all , the purpose of the advertisements is to point out the advantages of a product and this is usually achieved by exagerating them .

One common scenario on TV advertisements is to show happiness situations that are not necessarily related to the product being promoted .
For example , you can see a sad person in a gray rainy day whose mood changes to absolute happines as the sun rises automatically when they drink a coke .
Even though the weather has nothing to do with people drinking cokes , they try to sell the idea that a refresh drink can make you happy no matter what .

On the other hand , magazine and photograph based advertisements usually tend to use very simple triks such as showing products bigger than they are , or accompanied by a lot of accesories wich are not included , and sometimes not even sold at all , but make the real product look a lot more attractive .

Furthermore , some advertisements show results that can not be completely achieved by the product itself , to convince people to use them .
This is very common in diet products , where a very thin model wakes up in the morning to do some exercise but she just goes to the refrigerator and drinks a diet yogurth .
Desite of the fact that the yogurth could only prevent you from gaining extra weight , the propaganda makes it look like it actually can make you lose weight .

Finally , another issue is that the advertisements do n't show the dissadvantages of the products or if they do , because of some reglamentation , they do it as fast an ilegible as it is possible .
This is the case of alcoholic beverages ' advertisementes , which show a very small and really fast read phrase were they advertise that drinking in excess is not good for your health .

As a conclussion , it can be forseen that advertisements do n't usually say the hole truth about a product and one has to be very carefull in examining the real characteristics of it before buying or using it .

Wherever people drive their eyes either on the Tv or in the streets , the advertising campaigns are overwhelming our landscape making them full of expectations for the products they admire on the screen or in the newspaper .
But , unfortunatelly , most advertisements promise more than they can really deliver to the final customers .
The strenght of the marketing system of the multinational companies brands make people dreaming too much and the final customers are not very aware of the image technicity comapnies uses for making their produtcs more beautiful .

The message an advertisement wants to convey to the final consumer is delicately composed by the marketing system of the multinational brands .
The marketing allows the companies to sell dreams through their products campaigns .
For example , the consumer does not feel guilty to buy and dring too much Diet Coke because it is said to be produced with less sugar than the original one .
Similarly , the ones who buy electronics machine to do sport at home in order to get slimmer dream of being fit by using the machine promoted by the ad .

Moreover , people neglect too much the capacity of the computerizing of the image .
This occurs especially in the cosmetics industry where the brands show off the merits of their products .
They build beutiful advertisement campaigns with top models who display a beautiful skin quality , which is the result of computer works .

Successful people , try to create something different , use oppurtunities to do something new in their fields and take risks .

First of all being successful needs the ability of trying new things other than the usual .
Trying new things and creating some ideas make the person to move upwards in his or her career .
For example creators of the '' Youtube '' did something that has not done before .
They find an idea , improve it and create the one of the most successful internet sites which cause revolution in this field .
So being open to new things and able to show the ability to implement this idea makes a person successful .

An other ability needed for being successful is , using the oppurtunities and not to be afraid of doing something unusual .
People often stick with things that are good at , but trying new tehniques and using the oppurtunities to do something new and different , brings the success .

The last thing I like to mention about what brings success is , taking risks .
Other than doing the standart things and taking risks can be very beneficial to someone .
For example , showing the courage to invest in a field that no one has ever invested before may turn out very well .
The risk taker may earn a fortune simply just using the opportunity by taking risk .

In summary , people who are open to try new things , creating something different than the others by using opportunities and take risks are allways become successful at the end .
No matter how hard they try , people who have these qualities will garantee the success .

1482,246408.txt,P3,KOR,medium,"It is debatable that teenagers , these days , put the time to help their communities. a rapidly growing number of people think that young people also help thier communities because they are belonged to a wide range of groups and those groups participate in helping communities .
In contrast , I strongly believe that students do not spend their time to helping their communities because they not only focus on more difficult exams , but also tend to become selficient .

First of all , these days , a lot of difficult exams or tests make students spend more time .
Young people study hard to enter more prestigious universities .
Thus they focus on studying rather than helping their communities .
According to reserch of Chosun-ilbo , one of the leading newspapers in Korea , a number of students who give the seats to the elder or visit the orpanage or silver house .
The reserch demonstates that 70 % students respond that they do not have enough time to think about other things , instead of studying .

On top of that , teenagers do not think other people whether they are poor or not .
They have tendency of selfcient .
In the past , many students consider their communities when communities have special party or festival for reconition of communities , so they frequently help install tools or stages .
The best example of this is that my father help making stages of the rural festival of harvesting .
He said that at that time , most students who lived in thier communities gave the their hands in order to succeed the festival .
On the other hand , when our communities have beach festival every summer , even though our communities ask help assistance , no students emerged the cite to install stages , hence the festival failed .
In this respect , at present , students are selficient compared to the past .

In conclusion , young people do not spend enough time to giving thier hands for communities .
The reasons are the stuends concentrate studying more to enter the better universities , and teenagers are more selficient that the past .
All in all , a substantial nmber of students study at home , even though the our communities want to need the assistants of teeanagers .

and they are people who like the perfection .

I think people have to be curious to succeed , that 's why they want to try knew things .
They always want to know more .
For example , a successful doctor will be the one who will have the curiosity to perfectly understand a disease and who will have the curiosity to developp research on the disease .

Moreover , successful people rapidly get borried with the things that they know how to do well .
They want to change and try new things and take risks because it gives them some adrenaline !
They are looking for some originality instead of always doing the same thing .
For example , a successful actor will look for a role very different than the one people are expexted in him , it will gives him some excitement and show some qualities that people do n't know of him .

3396,588160.txt,P5,KOR,high,"The number of cars in use has significantly increased during the past decades and it has been a controversial issue that this tendency will continue in the future as well .
Some people might claim that the number of cars in use will continue increasing possibly thanks to the increasing population in the world .
However , I think in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , for two reasons ; high gasoline prices and increasing interest in the enviornmental issues throughout the world .

Firstly , the price of gasoline has been fluctuated over the past years , partly due to the nature of the resource - limited and will eventually dry up - , and therefore it is easy to say that the price of gasoline will continue going up .
Also partly because of the tensions in the Southwestern Asia region , where the resource is mainly come from , due to the political conflicts and war , the supply of gasoline seems to have been unstable and this situation has affected the price of gasoline considerably .
For these reasons , the price of gasoline is very likely to be unstable , and eventually , continue rising ; it would be more and more difficult to use cars financially , which could lead to a fewer number of cars in use .

Secondly , as the large number of cars in use has considerable effects on the enviornment mainly by polluting the air , the increasing interest in the protection of enviornment might bring some restrictions or limitations on the number of cars in use .
For example , in Korea , although it is not legally restricted , it is encouraged not to drive at least once a week by the government program to make the air of Seoul cleaner .
Although it is only the recommendation by government , given that the many countries and NGOs have greater interest in the environment issues than they did before , it could be said that there would be some governments which start to make restrictions on the number of cars in use in the cities to protect their enviornments .

All things considered , although it cannot be predicted accurately , I think it can be said that the number of cars in use will be less in twenty years than it is now for two reasons such as following , 1 ) the price of gasoline will be unstable and eventually will rise too much to run a car and 1 ) the greater interest in the enviornmental issues may lead the government to impose restrictions on the number of cars in use in the future .

Some person belive strongly in it , instead any other are sure that it can produces negative effectives in the quality of our life .
In my opinion advertisments make products seem much better than they are in the reality , and so in the following paragraphs I try to explain my point of view .
When we watch televison or when we walk to the street , we can easy see adverstiments ; they talk about food , for instance , or clothes , cars , bank services etc ..
In all these situations the objects , or the products , appear beautiful , confortable and in same case chip , nethereless when we decide to buy one of them we have a surprise .

For example , the last year I saw a beautiful photography machine in a television advertise , it seemed very small , easy to use and with a lot of different functions .
In this way , I convinced my boyfriend to buy this model becuase I thought it was an incredible occasion , infact the price is not so high in relation wiht the quality .

The day after he decided to buy this photography machine , and unfortunately my boyfriend and I , using it , understand that it use not so good .
The same situation happens when we buy a food only for the fact that it is presented in a particular way in the advertise ; for example , the advertise uses a specif enviromental , color or situation to expain the caracteristics of the food , and as a consequence we immidiately decide to buy it .

It includes understanding ideas , concepts , learing process , and getting the facts .
There are discussions about which is more important during the learing process .
I think it 's more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than just to know the facts .

As is known to all , during learning , we should not just care about the results , we should also care about the important ideas and concepts underlying the results .
We should make clear that we know how we can get the results , that 's how we can go through the understanding ideas , integrating concepts , and making derivarition to get the results .

Nowadays , because of the study competition , students care much about the grades they can get .
During study , sometimes , they just want to get the right answer without knowing why it comes to this not another .
Sometime , they even just memorize the results as to get the right marks in the test .
This is contradictory with the real goal of learing .
Facts are important , but the ideas and concepts we should learn through the process of getting facts are more important .
So the students should not just satisfied with the right facts , they had better pursue the right process through which we can get the right answer .

Learing prepare us the backgrounds , knowledge and technology for our future work .
This includes the ideas and concepts those are strongly confirmed .
The facts are just one kind of methods to help us understand ideas and conepts better .
The facts for different situations are different .
Even we know the right facts at this time , if we ca n't master the methods and technology gaining from the basic ideas and concepts which are used to get the facts , we wo n't get success in our future work .
In future practical conditions , everything is new , every problem is like a stranger to us .
We ca n't use the facts we memorized before to get the conclusion , we should try our best to use the ideas and concepts we have mastered to get the new conclusions .

As a result , the student not only asks questions about the event , but also takes it further by trying to make an explanation to the cause of the event .
This is what is called analytic reflection .
For instance , we can talk about the exam in Turkey before graduating from college .
We study for 2 years or more without understanding the main ideas .
Consequently our future depends on one single test .

On the other hand , learning facts is also important but not as important than understanding the essential .
If a student is only learning facts , he ca n't get any further than providing simple relations between events or comparing them .
He just ca n't figure out why .
But a student wh understood the concepts can ask questions , `` Why ? , Who ? , What ? , Where ? ''
.
He can eventually answer them too .
We can see this as an escalade .
The ideas help us to get to the top , while the facts help us to see two steps beyond .

In conclusion , both systems are important .
They help making progresses to the students ' view of aspects .
However for me , understanding the ideas and concepts are more important .
They provide an analytic reflection .

1915,330072.txt,P4,TUR,medium,"in advertisement endustry ther are sevrall things that you do to show the product different than what the way they really are or look .
but it is something that you have to do .
to be honest advertisement has nothing to do with honesty it is basicly about selling the product to the custumer and to do that you have to be creative and maybe a bit unreal .
it dosent matter that much wheather you believe everyhing you see or dont it is all about the campaine and how you brought it up .

the way it seems in real world we can say that advertising is the one of the bigest multimedia pover which can basicly control our needs .
but on the other hand the needs we need can be clasified by advertisements so we cant say that they are bad or wrong .

the main reasen why they make products seem much better is to take custemers attention .
no one seems interested whit regular stuff thats the basic of human habbits .
so they make it shine and glow so that we would want to have it .
as a resbonce to that potential custemers suchc as our neighbor or firiend saw it and atract to it then have it and afterwords we people have something to talk about such as `` have you seen what sally got ?
yes i did i saw it on tv `` than the chat goes on .
the advertisement can make people talk .

in my point of view sure they make products seem much better and sure it is the only reasen we buy them that is how it goes or how it supposed to go cause we all know that people wont concider buying anything unless they see it in somewhere else .
if advertisements can reach to them by shining and gloving the product i am afraid that as a sosiety this is who we are and how we deal whit the things by runnig to a shiny object .
we should defenitly give them a credit for what they are really doing .
to me have to show things better if they want to sell their products .
this is buisness .

Because in this way , traveler who come to the unknown area can do sightseeing whrere is not only popular shops and buildings , but also picked up place by tour conductor who know all this place , and do not careful for dangour of the area .
Traveler may not lost their way .

If I had been in situation making traveling plan , I should have confused .

For my answer , I will focus on the young in western societies of developed countries , because these societies are the one that I know best ( being part of them myself ) and because these societies are the one that leave the most leisure time to their younger elements .

In my opinion , it is impossible to formulate a definite answer to this question .
Even though it is true that some young people do not spend much time helping their communities , there are other that are more involved in helping their communitiesm such as the scouts , for instance .

Now , I do not think that young people who do not spend much time helping their community should be considered one and only category .
Some of them do not have the time , especially who are in particularly difficult field of studies .
There are also those who study ofr profession that do help the community , such as firemen , doctors , and so on .

Now I will asume that you want me to give or choose only one of the answers so am going with No , I for one do n't think that a successful people should try doing new things and to take risks .

1 - Because he could fail to succed in that new feild and then he wont be taken as a successful person .
2 - If he fails to succed in that he will waist abig period of time by taking a risk and most likelly he will feel down and dispointed in hem self .

3 - I belive that people should do what they love most because then they will do there best in it to succeed .
4 - In my obenion I see that its much better to know what am doing than feeling lost with something new on me .
5 - I think that if aperson have a goal that he wants to achive he must do his best to get to his goal and not to let risks to stand in his way even if he fails sometimes he should go back and try again and to tell him self that he did't fail but he learnd something new that this is the wrong way to it , thats what adison saied to him self after 1000 of faild experiments to invent electresty .

10840,1768412.txt,P8,JPN,high,"The issue of whether successful people try new things and take risks rather than the people who do only what they already know is interesting one .
In my opinion , the successful people should have challenging spirits .

First of all , the most succesfull people have been something of challengers to date .
For example , Soichiro Honda , who was a founder of a Japanese car maker called ` HONDA ' , was a typical challenger .
Before founding his company , he was a only owner of small cycleshop .
But , he had a great ambition and strongly desired to help the people who were at a loss in mobility .
Eventually , he invested the first motor cycle in Japan .
It was not only his challenge , he endevored many things after this and founded his company .
Nowadays , HONDA has successed his challenging spirits and tried many new things , such as making robot called ` Asimo ' , investing hydrogen electric motor car etc .

However , it is not necessarily that every challenging brings success every time .
For example , about 100 years ago , there is a trade company called ` Suzuki Shoten ' in Japan .
The people who worked for this company were full of challenging spirits .
But , unfortunately , their efforts went too far .
Their attitude which they tried something new and spend money on it lead this company to bankrupt .
This was an example that challenging has not only advantage but also disadvantage .

But , I can safely say that people never get the chance to be success if they only do what have been manualized and never want to take any risks because everybody can do the same things in the same way .
In other word , nobody can stand out from the crowd without new challengings which make person distinguished from others .

In conclusion , only the people who made a lot of efforts to challeng something new can abtain big succsess .

6479,1066453.txt,P5,JPN,medium,"I disagree with this opinion that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
I will raise the reasons in following passages .

First , as one of the japanese , and one citizen of the developed country , I think there are possibilities that the number of the cars in use will be reduced , because particulary in City , the person can transport easily without a car thanks to the sophistication of the network among train , subway , and bus .
And I think in the part of suburban also develop the similary methods to transport like City .
But what I want to say here is that the opinion I mentioned now is too micro to think globally .

Second , I think we must think more worldwide .
In the earth , there are many countries want to be more developed .
In these countries , I think that the number of cars in use is increasing .
The reason why the developing country will use more cars in future is that , to develop the country economic capacitiy , the needs of cars will increase to transporate many goods to commerese .
I think the transporation abilitiy has a significant meanig to these countries .

In conclusion , to think world development , I think disagree with the opinion .

1821,314993.txt,P8,DEU,high,"It is a much debatted topic in psychology , in companies or among friends what actually makes a successful person successful .
Are there certain characteristic that all successfull people have in common ?
Characteristics that are essential ?
Do we for example need to be risktakers in order to be successful ?

Sometimes it is stated that successful people are not satisfied with things they arelady know how to do well .
They do not rest on their achievments but rather go out , explore , take risks and are willing to do and try out something new .

I would say that there are a lot of different ways to be successful .
It is not only depending on the definition of success ( is not the same for everybody ) , but also on the area or subject in which you are working or lets say be successful .

For example someone that has a certain speciality can be successful in a certain profession without that above stated charactersitic .
A model for instance just looks very well and s/he can be very successful in her subject without ever going new ways or taking risks .
S/he just has to stick on what s/he already knows .

In other areas I would say it is definitively essentail to be a risktaker .
For example when you are working in a research department it is essential that you have good and new ideas .
That characteristic is necessary to be able to perform this job well because if you are always just thinking about what you already know there would never be any progress .
Another example is when you want to open up an own business .
You are definitley going a new , unexplored way by doing this because you cannot predict for sure how things will develope .

In my opinion it is not essential to try new things or take risks in order to be succesful .
I would rather use this statement the other way around : When you are risktaker and you like to explore new things you are more likely to be successful than a person that always sticks to the things s/he already knows .

Young age means the teenage where most of the people spoil their life rather moulding it into a good future .
They study till the secondary school but as soon as they enter into their college life they enjoy rather concentrate on their studies .

Young people enjoy in their teenage keeping studies aside .
Most of the people in their young age are not aware of the future .
They just waste time in enjoying and partying .
so that they cannot became a successful person in these society .
He cannot reach his goal .
Every person has their on goal but we have to fulfill .
By enjoying we waste half of our life and suffer half of the life .
Their is no use of recognition after the teenage is passed .

They think that they have grown up and can handle their decisions on their own .
they think that they know what is right and what is wrong .
They go on for parties without the permission of parents and return late nights .
They smoke , they drink and commits lots of mistakes .
They break the parents reputations .
But the same person when he comes to old age he shall think of the past what he have done .
He stops all the enjoyments and concentrate on the works and settlement .
He thinks as a mature person .

Young people are not matured and cannot take decisions on their own .
They live in a world of fantasy , passionate and fashionable .

It is true that it has advantages .
By broading knowlege acadmic subjects , one can rcognize and choose what subject one want to learn most and one can understand the expand of academic area also .
But I think if one is a student , he already has decide what he want to learn before taking many academic subjects .
Therefore I strongly agree with the thought to specialize in one subject .

I have two reason to support my opinion .
The one is that in business they need people who specialized in one subject .
For example , in Japan , for last fifteen years , they had needed a generalist who were able to do everything not so bad in the office .
But he were not able to do one thing better than anyone .
Genaralists were able to do everything but they did not have charactaristic abilities .
So Japan cannot catch up with United States in the financial business matter yet .
In addition , a generalist may be replaced to someone whose payment is cheeper than his , because there is no reason he is the person who is need for the position in the company .

The other is that unless one consentrate on one subject , he cannot understand the interesting of the subject .
Once one specialized one thing , he can proud of himself and this extends his intrest in other subjects .

There are many skills and alote of excersis that to help the students to learn and to get the highest degrees in their live .
There are some arguments and there are several opinions talk about what the better ways for the students in the education , understand or memorize .
Some of these arguments said that the understand ideas is more important for the students .
I agree with that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts because that make them better .

And I have some reasons supports my opinion , these I discoverd its when I was students and now when I am working at the school in my country , Kuwait .

First of all , when the students are staying in the class and they are just listning for the teacher they will not learn any thing , in fact they will forget every thing after few days .
For example , when I was in high school , tha mathmatics teacher always gave us the questions with the answers and he never let us to thinking about the questions and the result always had bad because it the test we woul face new questions and we did n't know how we can firgure out its .
On the other hand , the biology teacher was teach us the main idea and we hade to discover and search about the information in the internet , on the books , newspaper , for instance .
So , if we understand good we will be better .

Socond , now I am working at middle school .
and I feel that when I give my students some ideas and I push them to work and to search and discover new things the result would be good .
but if I give them evry thing and they couldn ' understand the result of course would be bad .

All on all , when we teach our students how they can understand the ideas and if we help them to understand these ideas that will be help our students to learn tha facts and will improve them skills in the education .

7990,1234298.txt,P1,DEU,high,"This question is really important not only for people who are planning and starting studies at a college or university but also for people already working in a specific area .

In my eyes you should specialize in a specific subject as soon as possible .
There are a lot of academic areas you can study so at first you have to identify that one that fits best to your personal interests .
When you are intersted in maths for example it does not make a lot of sense to study literature .
So at that point you have to make the first specialization .
In my eyes that will help you to succeed in your studies because you are learning something about topics you are really interested in .

After finishing studies the process of specialization continues .
When you have studied business for example I think it does not make a lot of sense to search a job where you have to apply the whole knowledge you have collected during your studies .
You will lack the propper knowledge to perform difficult tasks which will lead to failure and in the worst case you will loose your job .

Therefore I think after finishing business studies for example you have to specialize again an maybe search for a job in the marketing or controlling departement of a company .
Even when you now work in a specific area , the process of specializing should still continue .
To become a successful employee for example I think you now must become a specialist in specific tasks of the area you are working in .
When you are working in the marketing departement of a consulting company for example you could specialize to the marketing of chemical products .

In my eyes these steps of specializing in a specific subject are the best way to become not only successful in your job but also help you to divide the important informations from the unimportant ones .
Altough you should not lack a propper knowledge about other academic topics you have to specialize in order to be not provided with a overload of informations you can not handle with .

Later , they take us to the famous places in the city like shopping malls and multicuisine restaurants etc .

Apart from all this , tours of educational purposes like for instance , study on birds , trees etc , in forests they guide us about the safe and the unsafe locations , so that we can caution ourself while moving around .

8260,1285151.txt,P2,FRA,high,"For the decades young people have been considered to be more willing to enjoy life than older people do unlike in ancient time when it was common sense that you could not enjoy life until you had reached a certain age .
How can we explain those statements

One thing is for sure ; young people tend to seize each day because even in his early age an human being is fully aware of his fragility and on day he will die like everybody else .
One could argue that applies even more to older people but i truly believe that this feeling is fundamental in the mind of a youth .

I do believe that young people enjoy more life and i think that it is the consequence of the desire of a teenager or a young adult to break free and to be in charge of everything when it comes to his life .
Therefore because it is the first time that they have the opportunity to live fully they enjoy life like they will never again , paradoxically enough it is enjoying your life that makes you forget after a certain lapse of time what it is to really enjoy life .
With time you tend to take everything for granted and you realize one day that your missing the simple pleasures that you used to crave about .

Growing up is an hard time for everyone ; it is the time when you are trying to figure out who you are and what you want to do .
In this time of insecurity usualy young people are smart enough to make the best of what they have amd to take advantage of anything that might happen to them .

Its the exuberance of youth that always motivates one towars more colorful side of life and thats what lack in the older people .
In the age of teen , every individual has a desire to experience the life to the fullest .
he aims high to achieve his goals .
He studies hard to get into a good university .
After getting enrolled , he plans well and again studies hard with great perseverance to get a good score and finally a degree that will provide him the platform to move further ahead in life .
After he gets a satisfactory job or starts some business , he wants to settle in life with a loving and caring spouse .
Taking responsibilities and standing by them gives him the immense pleasure of being successful .
So he is always in process of making life better .
When he is 30 to 35 , he plans for his kids , their schooling , their upbringing in a better environment .
And as the time passes he becomes weak and old , not strong enough to take care of his family .
Rather he becomes dependent on his children for his small needs .
Surrounded with health troublems , he rarely get anytime for enjoyment .
But not neglecting those special exceptional cases that justifies the quote `` your age is what you feel '' .
A well planned and organised life can definitely expircate the weekness of oldage .
Neglecting the negatives aspects of oldage , if one loks towards the postive facade , its the oldage that makes the life complete .

I totaly agree in studing more subjects than what you need is the better because this will increase your credit hiurs that will give a scholarship in your college study and thiscould allow you to change your study any time you see it is an appropiate for you or the study is n't helpful for your life .
You wo n't be able to change your major unless you completed the subject required or your credit hours fulfill thier need to let in the major .

What will you lose if it took three hours from your week studing a subject that you do n't want ?
NOTHING , you will gain personal or general Knowledge and it may raise your average instead of lowering it as you may thought .
Sometimes the person should look into the advantage of the subject instead of the disadvantages .
for example , you may be a well known doctor with an excellent salary and you did n't want to study biology .
Think many times before you make a dececion .

It will be a world with less cars and more trains and shared veicholes .
It wo n't be an easier or more economic world , but it will be cleaner for sure .

It is time to change and everybody cares about our future , so for this reason it is time that all the government of the world start to think about that and not just to have a better future , but to have a future that permit human beings to live in a safe world .

Firstly as there will be an advance in technology there will also be an industrial developement .
Due to this more amount of people in todays world a shifting from using bikes , two wheeler vehicle 's to car 's because it increases the safety of the people .
As time pass by old car will be replaced by newer car which would work by a hydrogen cell which is extremly harmless .
By then technologly would have advanced and instead of using pertoleum as fuel product water will be used as source of fuel .
This explains the reason as to why there wil be an increase in the production of car 's in the next twenty year's

Secondly as time passes by technologly will be so advanced that everything will by handled by a robot .
So an increase dependence on robot and robotic car 's will be the main aspect after twenty years their dependence will be the main reason why there will be an increase in the production of car 's in twenty years .

In contrast to this there may be certain othere problems faced there may be shortage of steel which is most important thing required for the making of the car moreover there may be problems like the shortage of fuel which may obstruct the the development of the car 's because as time pass by our petroleum reserves may die down and thus the making of the car 's may be reduced

I strongly believe that having broad knowledge of many subjects is more benefical for social person and solve problems efficiently .

First of all , more vast knowledge allow us to be social person .
Although specific information render to think deeply , a lot of knowledge is more benefical to think widely .
In our society , where gradually increase piece of information because of internet , haves and not haves of infomarion has a considerable gap .
At this time , wide infomation is more essencial requirement for living in society .
For example , when I was watch the program of Olympic game every 4years , I need to absorb about the role of each game to totally understand whether win or not .
Morever , when face social issues such as green house , we should have a information several subjects such as the aspect of social , knowledge of science and the law of world for talking with others about them .
This shows that if we do not want to be isolated person , we should have broad knowledge .

Next , broad knowledge of academic subjets is necessary for solving problems efficiently .
When people have a problem whatever faced in life , they need to solve that for using many information .
For example , when my parent were having a problem with sell a house , they had to gather many knowledge such as economic , law and enviroment .
They wants to get a money by selling a house , so they had to consider to economical aspect in society .
Moreover , they wished to reduce tax , that is why they should to learn about law .

However , contrary to this opinion , I strongly believes that people who live modern times should have broad knowledge of a lot of subjects .
The reason behind this is that the period when we are living now needs someone who have a variety of knowlege .
Moreover , if someone focus only one specipic subject , he or she might be biased without balace .

First of all , I strongly believe that people who are living this period should have wide knowledge of many acadcemic subject .
The reason behind this is that one academic subject is connecting with others .
When it comes to biotechnology , people are eazy to think that it has no relationshio with philosophy at all .
However , when I wached the some SF movie , ` Island ' , I deeply concerned about the technology to make new lives , so called gernorm project , is reasonable and ethnical .
It is a problem of philosopy .
This example shows that these two academic subjects are very imtimate each other .

Secondly , If someone commited only on only one specific subject , he or she might be biased losing his or her academic balancing .
This is because I believe that academic areas originated from one subject , which was not divided like now .
As society began to divided and specialized , the academic subjects began to separated too .
However , nowadays , there are new tries to combine the separated acacemic areas for more academic progress .
For ecxample , to cure patients , doctors are working with sociologist because the reason that patients suffer from disease come from not only health illorder , but also social problem such as too much stress and envirionmental pullution .

In sum , without any hesitation , I strongly believe that it is better to have broad knowledge o fmany academic subjects that to specialize in one sucject , All in all , academis in one .

3788,657770.txt,P2,DEU,high,"Many people believe that young people enjoy life to a higher degree than older people do .
In my opinion , this is a statement that is not correct since it fundamentally denies the complexity of the issues of joy , life and age and tries to deliver a general and simplified statement .
In those crucial matters , however , I believe that trying to make a general point is not helpful in any way .
Therefore , I disagree with that statement , both because of its content and because of the way the content is delivered , namely through generality .

First of all , it is certainly a question of the perspective from which one looks at to what degree people enjoy life .
Young people might believe that older people enjoy life less because of their decreasing health conditions or because of the decay of their outward appearence whereas older people might be of the opinion that it is the youth that enjoys life less since , being at an early stage of life , they still have all the hardships of life in front of them .

In this connection , it is certainly a question of definition what it means to `` enjoy life '' .
There is no such thing as a scale measuring the joy in life that valid for every person , and there is no need to create such scale .
Everyone has a different view on life and different expectations that contributed to joyful life .
Some people enjoy life doing sports , others enjoy life by achieving financial success .
That feeling is not objective but rather subjective and it is not possible to really compare those individual feelings .
Different people have different priorities in life .
Thus , trying to decide whether younger people enjoy life more than older people do or vice versa seems impossible since it denies the very individual character traits , opinions and views that one holds .

In my opinion , it is a question of how old one really feels .
As for myself , I know a 73-year-old man who is as active as he could ever be , perfectly indulging in sports everyday by running cross country before breakfast .
This exemplifies that every individual is as distinctly different from others .
Therefore , categories of people enjoying life more or less than others do not make any sense .

In conclusion , I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do , because of the fact that on the one hand , everyone has to define solely for himself or herself what it means to enjoy life .

1284,214190.txt,P4,DEU,medium,"When we reading the newspaper in the morning , watching TV or walking along a mall we indirect recognize that the numbers of advertisments increasing .
All these advertisments promise that this product will be the best and will makes you successfull and provide you a comfortable life .

The question is , if the promises will get real ?

Short time ago I read an article of an bulb supplier .
This brand supplier promised that the bulb which this company produces are have a better quality , a higher lifecycle and the efficency is any percent higher than all competitive products .
In order to save energy I trust this ad and bought a lot of these bulbs and I payed more than for a competitor product .
I was happy to get a high quality product .
A few days later the first bulb was defect .
I brougth it not back to the store beacuse it is more expensive to drive to the store .

A few day later I met a friend .
He told me that he visited the factory which produces these bulbs .
He explained that millions of bulbs where produced and the last process of the production is the brand stamp on the glass and the packaging .

He explained that the same produced bulb will get different brand or noname stame and will get different packaging boxes .
This means that the same produced product , with the same quality and the same effectivity will be sold with a higher brand price and a lower noname price .
I checked the different brands and noname products he told me and found out that only the price has a difference .

As conclusion of this I will no more trust any advertisments .
Advertisements are designed to sell products .
They promising a lot but not the truth .

8875,1405265.txt,P8,DEU,high,"In this essay I will write about my opinion of a risky attitute of a person , if it is rather good or bad .
In my opinion the way of being successful is parted into two parts .
One part is that a person , who wants to be successful , has to risk something , or , try something new .
Without that , the person will always stay on one point and will not move on .
The person will not get any further on the persons privacy , nor at work .
The person shows that he really wants to achieve somthing by risking something that is really important for him .
As an example someone , who has his job as journalist for a newspaper since 20 years and always wirtes about the weather .
He has a new idea which could mean to lose his job and still presents it to his boss .
He risks his own job , but he could also get further in his carrier .
By being risky , the person get something special , because not everyone does something new , which no one tried before .

On the other hand the boss for an example has to count on you .
So if you try something new and you faile , you can lose your job or do not get the chance to move on in your carrier .
To be successful means also teamwork .
When a person tries to be special and does not work with the others , because he tries to be better than them , than his success will stop at the point , when he needs his colleagues .

To conclude , a risky person has to know where he has to stop and when he has to work with his colleagues .
When he follows those points ( which I mentioned before ) he has the ability to be successful .

8110,1258115.txt,P6,TUR,medium,"I do not agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
There are many disadvantages to follow the tour guide .
Even getting a tour guide can be harmful and dangerous for tourists .

First of all , when you follow the tour guide to see around the city which you want to see and travel , you only can see places in which the tour guide shows you and your group .
You can not find out around of city .
Everytime there are some limitations which are made by the tour guide .
For example , you want to see other side of city , but there is a certain travel program which includes to see certain place in the city .
You have to follow the travel program .

Second of all , People who are from that city can understand that you are tourist .
This sutation has some dangeours point .
They can cheat on you or sell kind of present things to you much more expensive .
For example , when you go to a store for shopping , if they understand that you are a foreigner or a tourist they can try to sell many things much more expensive , but if you travel alone and you can speak the language of that country which you want to see they can not understand that you are a foreigner or a tourist .
So people who are from that country or that city can sell things to you in original price .

Third of all , is traveling with groups not expensive activity but also it is a so dangerous .
There are many terrorits people or groups who want to kidnapp to tourists and foreigner people to come true their bad purposes .
Those kind of people can realize that you are a tourist , because you are travelling with the group and following the tour guide .
They can kidnapp you and kill you .
Furthermore they can use you for their purposes .
That situtaion happenned the tourists many times .
Those people killed the tourist or got money from the tourist of family .

In above , there are many advantages about traveling alone and following the tour guide .
The quite proverb says that `` It does not matter whatever travelling alone and following tour guide cost , people can listen their heart and make their ways for travelling . ''
That 's why we have to travel alone .

519,94768.txt,P5,JPN,medium,"I agree with the statement for the following reasons .

First , the public concern about environmental pollution has been increasing remarkably .
Because the problem of global warming by exhausted gus from car is one of the big problems at present , people cannot help paying attention and trying to prevent the increase amount of the gas .
For example , many people are sick because of air pollution by car and some abnormal conditions occur these days , for example insects which people only see in tropical countries are discovered in some countries .
So , people rethink using their cars because car is one of the major cause of increasing the global warming .

Second , people realize the limit of oil production .
Nowadays , the skyrocketing oil price is one of the big problems in the world .
Because the Japanese depend on imported oil for most of its energy , the increasing price influences directly public life expences .
Then , people cannot taking public transportation such as bus and train to suppress their money .

Also , government faces the problem of global warming by exhausted gas from car .
There is a law called Kyoto Protcol and some countries contribute together to stop this problem .
And , media deals with frequently this problem .
However , although this kind of law , not all countries , especially developped contries participate in this contribution .
Then , countries which have already been members of this law , make more effort to state the importance of the law and the need of their contibution in order to keep our planet clean as much as possible in the future .

Therefore , I think the statement is reasonable and we should do that .
I think also that it is important for people to cultivate their mind which think seriously the global problem and contribute to deal wiht this matter .
"
715,115435.txt,P6,HIN,medium,"Undoutedly I would say that I agree with the statement given here that `` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .

My first reason is , as we go to a new place , we may not be knowing how the place is , how will the behaviour of the people look , what their culture is , what their customs are , what their tradition is etc .
If we go to some Latin American countries , we may find some difficulty in understanding their language and also we ca n't understand their accent even though they speak english .
For example , suppose that you planned to go to france , the language the people speak there is French , you may not understand French where you need a guide .

Second reason is , if the place you planned to tour a historic place with out a guide , you finnaly end up with the rocky structers you see there .
As each historic place has a history behind it , the main purpose of visit is to know its history , a guide is right person to explain it for you .
For example when you go on a tour to Egyptian pyramids , you may not know who build them , how they are build , but if you have a guide with you he can help you explain all these details .
After all you derive a lot of thrill and in turn a great happiness by knowing all these details .

On the contrary when you tour alone or with you kith and kin who do n't know anything about either the place or the history you can not enjoy the place just becauce you do n't know the details and there will be every possibility of getting detoured .
When you encounter a mysterious inscriptions scribbled on stone you alone on your own can not decode them in order to enjoy the trip to the fullest extent .

Having considered all the reasons given about I would say that I strongly agree with the given statement .
"
7385,1149147.txt,P8,DEU,high,"I agree with the fact , that if you want to be successful , you have to take risks sometimes .
I want to stress that it does depend on the individual 's situation .

For example , if a creative director of an advertising agency has had lots of success with using one certain method in creating an ad , it is smart to stick with that method .
At some point , as time changes , people 's interests change and the creative director needs to consider a differnt method in creating an ad .
If the director wo n't consider doing so , he might lose his clients .
This is when I would say that it is important to take a risk and do something different with your ad .

Based on my own experiences I have to say that I had more success with taking risks at times .
For example , I have great passion for the arts and therefore , I have taken quite a few drawing and painting classes in the past .
At some point , one of my teachers graded me down on one of my projects , because apparently I always used the same method in drawing , and I never tried something new .

This is when I decided to try pastell paint , instead of the good old charcoal .
My teacher was impressed by the color composition , which was a change from just black and white drawings .
My teacher gave me a better grade , not necessarily because the picture was better than my other pictures , but rather because of the fact that I was able to deal with something new , such as pastell .

Trying new things gives you exposure to different perspectives , which makes you a more open person to new things .
If you constantly stick with the same old thing , you show a lack of flexibility .
It also shows that you can only be successful in the same area .

If you try and practice different things , it gives you the opportunity to show more expertise in different areas .
If you do n't take the risk of trying something new , you never know whether you could be more successful or not .
"
597,105061.txt,P8,ZHO,high,"Do successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well ?
I do n't agree with that .
I think experience , time , and the higher possibility of success are the main points to support my opinions .

Firstly , experience helps people to be successful in doing one job .
If a person has a lot of experience on doing one job , he can usually make the best decision when a problem comes out .
Compare to a person who makes a decision when he does a new job , he is unexperienced and has no idea which way has more benefits for him .
So he can easily make a wrong or worse decision .
So successful people would do what they already know how to do well because they have experience .

Secondly , we need enough time to make our jobs successful .
Working a job to be successful is a long process .
A person who does a job which he already knows how to do well , saves a lot of time on understanding basic knowledge of the job .
Then he can spend more time to make the job perfect and and make himself to be successful .

Finally , a person does a job which he already knows how to to do well , he has a higher possibility of success than those who try new things and take risks .
As we know , if we try a new job , we have no experience about that and have to spend plenty of time to understand the job .
It is risky to do that because we might find out we are not able to make it successful after spending a long period time .
On the contrary , if we already know a job well , of course we know what to do to make it successful directly efficiently .

I disagree that successful people try new things and take ricks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , because they do n't have experience , enough time and a higher possibility of success in doing the new job .

7771,1192415.txt,P3,ZHO,medium,"I disagree young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their communties , because of two reasons .
Here are my reasons .

Firs , if one person does n't want to give his enough time to help other people that means he is selffish .
I jointed a interview process and new hired people training of my company .
In my opinion , If there are two people at the siminar work position .
The better man always be the one who pay more time to help other people .
The God always helps the one who loves help other people .
The one who loves pay more time to help people .
He will get the feedback of others .
You never know when will other people feedback your help .

Once I worked in a local campany , but I always help people and do some volunteer works on patient group .
Till I want to work at a Global company .
Some people help me to get interview and get a job at a worldwide famous company .
Give enough time to helping communtites not only gives me peace , lovely feeling but also give me wild view to see the world .

Second , I can see the gap of salary in my country becomes biger and biger .
This big gap brings some public security problems .
The rich person affrid to be hostage , the poor people do n't have money to give their child well education .
Why do n't we give enough time to helping our communities ?
Give the poor person help to educate , get work and resept .
We will not have much more public problem .
Moreover we will feel happy and lovely .

According these two reasons , I disagree young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping communities .
Young people are like sponge .
What you teach them what you earn .
Moreover young people have to study and they have ability to care other communities .
Give enough time to helping communtites is a win-win solution to makes our world better and lovely .

However , some people against this , saying that older people have more children to share happiness and sadness , and also older people have a lot of actities to take part in .
As far as I am concerned , both young people and the old people energy life .

As we know , young people in school have a lot of time .
they can play with them .
talk with them , and study with them .
School offers a wonderful stage for young to enjoy their life .
In addition , When young people have some problem , a lot of people could give them a hand , such as , their parrents , teachers , partners , bosses , and so on .

The young people can sure benefit from that , they also can energy better .
Finily , young people have more energy to engoy their life .
They can do whatever they want to do , they can experience a lot of new things that older people have never seen .
Such as computers vidio games .
MSN , ICQ and so on .

On the other hands , older people also enjoy their life .

The student have to do what they are from doing To learn facts is better than to understand ideas and concepts for students .
Here are some reasons to support my idea .

First of all , There is a soccer ball .
Everyone knows what to do with the ball .
If there is two people that person Awho has naver played soccer ; however knows the soccer ball very well , and person B has experiences to play soccer but , he does n't really know about the ball .
Person B knows about a soccer ball because he has learned facts to play .
Person A knows about the ball ; however , he does n't know how to play because he only has ideas .

Second of all , there is a blind , and he understand to play soccer .
However , he has never seen it and played .
The blind has ideas ; however , the ideas is not worth because he has naver done .
To do what he thinks will make the blind to learn playing soccer .

Third of all , there are students in the classroom and a professor is giving a lecture .
The professor makes students understand ideas and concepts ; however , the students do n't know what they are because of no experiences from the ideas .

Finally , there is a Korean adverb which is `` To do once is better than to listen to ideas . ''
According to the adverb , even if a person had ideas , there would be nothing before doing things .
Therefore , he will learn what the ideas are .

In conclusion , I believe that to learn facts is better than to understand ideas and concepts .
I 'm writing an essey with learning facts .
If I only understood the ideas of writing , I would never write anything .

3218,558258.txt,P7,TEL,low,"I agree that it is more important for student to understand ideas and concepts then it is for them to learn facts .
In a student age it is very much essential to get a idea and concept on the subject before learning facts .
For example maths is a subject where we shoud have an idea and the concept ie logical thinking of how we should do the problem .
If we dont have concept of how to do addition then how can we proceed furrter .
Concept is like a root to devolop furter .
When a student can understand about the idea and about the concept it is very much easy to learn about the fact .
The student if he starts understanding the concept and idea he can never forget the things .

witout a concept studying is simply muging up .
When the student starts understanding about the idea and the concept of a subject it is very much easy for him to learn .
At the student age only our main idea and the concept starts .
If a student is learning anything without a concept is something like root without a stem .
Whenever we want do something we shoud have an idea of what to do in a similar manner whenever a student is studying or doing any practical he shoud have an idea of wat to do and concept of it and then think about the facts .

Many students loose the oppurtunities because of lack of devoloping ideas , and lack of concept in the subject .
I feel if we have an idea and concept on the subject it is very much easy to learn .
Secret of success of many students because of there conceputial way of studying .
I conclude that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

5065,882583.txt,P5,JPN,high,"Cars have been the means of transportation around the world for centuries .
It is no doubt that the car is a major part of many peoples lives .
So will there be fewer cars in use twenty years from now ?
Well , I think that the car will very much be present twenty years from now and probably with more users then ever , with a few changes to the car 's functions and design of course .

I think that the car will change greatly over a twenty year period .
Resulting in a burst of popularlity with many individuals around the world .
I think that many of the functions of the cars will be changed as well .
I think that the car , twenty years from now will use electric fuel not gasoline .
I think this because there are many problems arising around the world regarding the price of gasoline .
Not only is the price of gasoline expensive but it is also destroying the atmosphere , resulting in global warming .
I feel that the car industry will thus , shift its vision on cars from gasoline to highly productive , well-made electric cars .
These electric cars will not only run on small amounts of electricity , but it will also have no exhaust pollution , creating a better and cleaner environment .
It is because that I think these changes will occur that I say that the number of cars will not diminish in the future .
I feel that with the environmentally friendly benefits and with the attachment that society already has on cars will make people keep riding cars .

I also think that there will not be fewer cars in twenty years because I think that many people in many socities are very attached to the car .
It is not a mere transportation vehicle , but it is a part of tradition to drive a car in many countries .
For example , it is a tradition to get your drivers license when you turn the age of 16 in America .
Also it is a sign of wealth in many countries to own a car in many countries , such as China .
Therefore , I feel that there will not be a decline in the use of cars because ; by losing the car you will lose many traditions , and traditions are a part of culture .
So it is hard for me to think that the human race would diminish an entire part of culture from there lives within a short period of twenty years .

The attachment to cars by the human society and the possiblity to alter cars to better suit the needs of the environment and the people , make me conclude that the usage of cars will not decline in twenty years .

To create a new thing in the situation I have described above requires a lot of knowledge , but this is not enough .
A succesful person , an `` inventor '' , should have also the right idea at the the right time and he or she should take all risks about his or her new thing .

In my opinion , new things can be realized only if someone starts to look further than what has already been created , written , seen and so on .
New things came directly from new perspectives or also from new needings .

Moving along a path that it has n't been created yet can led to some risks , but a person who want to create something new ca n't avoid that something goes wrong at a certain moment .

In fact , it is not !
our life is too small for acieving a dream like mine with all the other issues surrounding us and need our care and time .
Furthermore , different subjects may not always be in the same field , e.g : Physics which is an essential subject in the sciences field does not match History - a part of the humanities family .
In conclusion it is better for us and for our precious world and time to take a one way decision that we will take for our future according to our personality , self image , tendincies , capability and all the other requested needed information .
Specializing in one acadimic field and not subject is the most essential for me , for instance : if I chose a way that is most suitable for me and wish to pass it then I have to take a look on all the subways and instructions and neither pass it straightly nor blindly .

There are several arguments why I agree with the statement , that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

First of all the world population is still increasing very fast .
This aspects leads to an simlpe conclusion .
More people need more cars .
Especially the populations in the cities are growing , because there excits an movement from land to the cities for the last years .
For the people living in this big cities or the little towns neaby , it is usual to own a car .
So for this reason more cars are needed .

Furthermore there is another very important aspect .
The global buisness is getting much more important today and will be the main buissnes in the future .
I infer from this aspect , that in the future buisness people , or working people in general will need cars and plains much more than today .
I cannot imagine buisness men without a car even today and in the future it will be much more neccessary .

It is said , time is money !
And so it will be in the future .
The third aspect I am thinking of is , that people do not have much time today to reach theire destinations , because of the very tight schedulethey have .
This will not chance in future .
Today this mainly stands for buisness jobs , but in the future even this will change .
People working outside the cities on the fields will need more cars to get in the next city to provide theire products on markets .
I think in the future even farmers will try to sell things online , so a transfer form the land to the customer must be guarantied .
You will need more cars for this , too .

For example , Bill Gaze , the most rich person in the world , I think it 's a good sample for people who seccessed .

6691,1085663.txt,P8,FRA,high,"I do not believe that the given statement is true .
Indeed , I understand the logic which lies under that assumption but personally , I do n't have the impression that it is a veracity .

First of all , it is important to analyse why someone who only meets success is more likely to take risks than somebody else .
As a matter of fact , when you succeed a project , you feel satisfied .
The more you achieve what you want , the more you become confident .
Then , it is like a spiral : the more you get , the more you want to get .
In fact , when you plan to start a business and it works well , you think about expanding your activities .
If it works and you are already at the head of a big company , you may diversify your business .
That is why big companies like Bouygues are in building , mobile phones and so on .
Virgin makes discs but also develops its own mobile phones programs .
Those companies take risks , while entering new markets .
They believe in their success because they are supported by their customers .

However , new things are not always done by successful people .
Creativity , for instance , has nothing to do with sucess ; it is about personality .
So an artists does not always meet success .
Nonetheless , his or her desire to create will still go on .
That explains why a lot of painters did a lot of breakthroughs after many failures .
Another example is Alain Baraton , a famous gardner in Versailles .
He has failed during his school years but then , while he worked in Versailles he developed a passion for gardening and created new arrangements around the castle .
Besides , you can not be successful all the time but it does not means that you are less willing to do new things .
In addition to that , someone , who really wants to be recognised by the society and has never achieved that goal , will probably try everything he or she can .

As a conclusion , success is not so closely tied to ` boldness ' as the statement suggests .

In my history class , U.S. History 1 Honors , understanding the flow of events is as important , or more , as memorizing tons of factual informations .
When I took the course 's first test in the beginning of the semaster , expecting their to be only factual and straightfoward questions , I was amazed that how many ideas , concepts , and abstract questions appeared on the test .
For upcoming tests , I tried to understand all these idea questions by asking myself questions like `` why did this happen ? '' or `` why did this person tried to accomplish this ? ''
However , I found myself often lost and getting these types of questions wrong on the tests .
Then , I figured out a new way to get around this problem .
It was just to memorize more and more facts !
By knowing a lot of facts that have happened , I was able to gather all these informations and draw conclusions out of these facts .
Then , I was able to answer the troubling idea and concept question more accurately , and I started to understand the history as whole .

In addition , my chemistry class seemed like a pure essence of ideas and concepts in the beginning .
The class required me to understand these abstract ideas like balacing chemcal equations or figuring out proper atomic masses .
First , I was entirely lost and unable to learn how to solve these problems because I just could not understance the concept of it .
The teacher tried to help me out by re-explaning these thoughts and ideas over and over again , and I still needed more help .
Then , it was factual examples which really helped me to get these .
By looking at how the teacher and my friends solving these problems , I just learned what to do when problems approach to me .
I immitated their ways of solving problems , and I was able to solve any chemistry problem on my own .
This really made me think that learning factual process is as important as understanding the concept .

Thus , it is more important for students to learn facts than it is for them to understand ideas and concepts .
Of course , ideas and concepts are ultimate goals the students to achieve in school .
However , before they try to reach it , they really should learn factual informations enough first .
In that way , The students will feel much easier to understand the concepts .
Therefore , learning facts in firsthand is more important than understanding ideas for students .

8721,1374680.txt,P8,DEU,high,"It is often discussed in the media what factors are responsible for the success of an individual .
Many people believe that successful people try new things and are more willing to take risks rather than only doing what they are already capable to do .
In my opinion this point of view is correct because only people who take certain risks have the chance to excel in their career .

To begin with , an individual can only grow personally by taking certain risks .
For example , I did an internship in New York last year and could not have profited more from this experience .
Before flying to the US I was feeling insecure because I did not know what was about to happen during my internship .
I was worried because of the new language , the working environment and a possible culture clash .
Indeed , the first time in the United States had been difficult for me but every week was easier that the one before .
After completing my internship , I can wholeheartedly say that taking this risk has been the best decision of my life so far .
I am much more confident now and have gained personal and intercultural skills that will help me in my future career .

Furthermore I am convinced that every new experience has a definite impact on an individuals ' development .
Even if an experience seems to be negative at the beginning or a person does not succeed immediately , I am sure that these negative events only make a person stronger than before .
By analyzing the reasons for failing a person is able to work on certain individual weaknesses .

In addition to that , I want to point to the concept of learning .
For centuries it is widely accepted that people have to learn in order to become better in what they are doing .
Not only in school , college or university classes but also by attending work-shops in the professional life people are constantly forced to make new experiences and learn additional aspects about different issues if they want to be successful in life .

In conclusion , I absolutely agree that one characteristic of successful people is based on their willingness to try out new things rather than sticking to the things they already know .
Taking risks is fundamental if you want to succeed in life .
Only by facing challenges an individual will be able to grow as a person .

3288,570749.txt,P7,SPA,high,"Students can learn facts , but not necessarily understand them .
It is essential for any student to comprehend concepts in order to take advantage of what he or she has understood .
Learning facts might be useful if students understand and know to apply them .
Therefore , understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts .

A student who understands an idea is able to use it and put it into practice because he or she masters it .
For instance , understanding how temperature affects gas expansion will allow students to know when it is a good time to fill a car wheel with air .
However , if a student simply learns that higher temperatures tend to expand a gas , this concept will only be general knowledge and probably not useful for him or her .
In other words , understanding

When a student understands , he or she is expanding his or her knowledge as well .
Although learning facts also expands our views of the world , understanding is a far-reaching tool that might be benefitial to achieve good goals .
Understanding might help students in using ideas and concepts to solve real-life problems .
For example , imaging someone having problems taking out the grease of the dishes with only water .
If that person understnads the effect of soap in water , he or she will go and use soap .

Likewise , understanding ideas and concepts helps students to be more creative .
Students who have understood something are likely to look for new ways to apply to knowledge gained .
For instance , understanding

Consequently , it is very important to understand ideas and concepts in order for them to be useful .
Just learning facts has probably a negative impact on students because it only augments the knowledge the person has , and does not help him or her at all .

3349,580713.txt,P3,TEL,high,"I agree .

In this rapidly changing world with higher degree of sophisticated benefits , comforts , luxuries and entertainment , young people are not sufficiently motivated to lend a helping hand to the community in which they live in .

The changing dynamics of world in terms of pace , the benefits money can bring , young people are getting attracted to them and started pursuing money earning habits or past time activities from a younger age not witnessed earlier .

Right from schooling a ` comprasion attitude ' in terms of quality or higher rank is commendable , yet it becomes deplorable when it is described or implanted in the younger minds as a trigger to money earning activity .
Such an impression in the early stage lasts long and effectively works in the minds of younger generation in pursuit of that goal .

Another stage that younger prople fall prey to this attitude is when they are deprived of certain minimum comforts their peers are enjoying .
This may make them parasites and kill or supress their natural concern or feeling for others .

The wide variety of entertainment available now a days keeps away from helping the community , rather spend as per their wish to derive some pleasure .
Though nothing wrong in spending for one 's own entertainment or comfort or benefit or luxury , being a part of society contributing to the society is like paying back to the parents .

The attitude of paying back and concern for others also gives pleasure and creates a healthy atmosphere .
This type of metamorphosis can be brought out by collective effort and higher degree of introspection .

It becomes the bounden duty of the parents and teachers to explain the moral and social values of the system and ensure that such qulaities get inculcated gradually in younger generation .

By explaining and making them understandable about the pleasures of sharing and helping the needy , younger generation can be made more responsible and acquire these divine qualities .

8749,1380600.txt,P5,TUR,high,"In today 's highly mobilized society , cars have become an indispensible part of daily life .
It is now common in most families to have multiple cars , one for each member of the family .
However , while enjoying the innumerable advantages that cars bring to their lives people are becoming more and more aware of the down sides of having so many cars .
Considering this point , I agree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in the future than there are today .

The biggest price that today 's societies are paying for the convenience of having so many cars is definitely the deteriorating environmental conditions .
Cars probably have the largest contribution to air pollution among all the technological advancements that we can think of .
In the recent years , on the other hand , environmental awareness has been awakened by means of international treaties , scientific research and public advertising .
In my opinion , therefore , these efforts will have far reaching consequences and make future generations more sensitive on the issue .

What effects an individual directly , however , is not the global environment that he must do his part to protest but more than that the expenses that comes along with having a car .
As the organic energy sources on the planet diminish , oil prices will keep increasing , possibly at higher rates .
In the end , it will probably reach such to limits where people will be willing to give up their comfort in favor of their pocket .

The final point that I 'd like to make to support my argument is the gigantic technological advencement that we are witnessing in the fields of computers and the Internet .
Nowadays , one can work , buy , sell , communicate , read the daily paper and do much more on his computer without leaving the house .
This , however inadvantageous it might be for the health of the society , will surely have an effect in cutting down the number of cars that people have .
After all , what 's the point of having a car if you are only going to use it once a year to take it to the mechanic for its annual check ?

8359,1306423.txt,P1,KOR,high,"I certainly thinks that having a broad range of knowloedge is better than knowing a only one subject deeply .
However what I mean is little bit different than what it sounds like .
For exmaple , If you are a leader of the orchestra , it is really important for you to know all the techniques that are used in leading a orchestra .
However it can be better if that person knows how to play piano or other instruments , so he can at least knows that feeling and share the pressure of people who are following his signs .
Therefore I conclude that knowing many academic subjects in one broad speicific subject would be the best .
These are the examples .

Misto Takile , one of the most respected orchestra leader in Japan .
legend creater of Yokimusa orchestra .
Question is why was he so great ?
He was a great leader , his techniques were concise and simple to follow , therefore it reduced the confusion of players who are following , but that did not made him legend .
He had something more than that ; his ability of playing piano and violin was good as a professionals , He could teach a concert master how to play a piano or violion middle of the practice .
He was also an expert in music history , He was able to , and actually give lecture about music history in Tokyo university .
By knowing how to play instruments , he has share the feelings with players , and give them better , simpler leads .
By knowing the music histroy , he understood better about the song .
He knew broadly about his profession .
That is what made him great .

Kim Mary , world famous zoologist who designed Nanjing Zoo .
She has been famous because of her excellent and effective designs of zoos .
However for her to reach this level , she had to finish 5 majors .
First she has majored in medicine , second animal medical care , third three-dimension design , fourth building construction and last but not least , zoology .
She has gone through all that to become the best in her area .
She knows so broad about what she is doing , she could become the best in her subject .

Therefore I conclude that knowing broad range about one subject is the best answer to the question .
If you take little bits of everything , it does not give you depth understading and it does not help you a lot , However if you decrease the range and study deeply about all the subjects around your profession , it will give you lots of credit , it also might related to other big subjects as well .
You can possibly argue that Einstein was a math maniac who did not know anything else except math and physic .
But he was genius in a century , very exceptional case !
If you are not , and to be great in your area , I think it would be more beneficial for you to know broad range over your subject .

10955,1792998.txt,P7,ITA,high,"I completely agree with the statement which says that for students it is more important to understand ideas and concepts instead of learning facts .
I think that the basis for a wide personal culture , which stays forever with a person , are to find in what the person himself understands , not in the quantity of things he can learn ; obviously knowing facts , dates , names of historically relevant people is very important , but not much as the greater quality to understand the ideas which bring you to the fact .

For example , if you have to study a difficult subject as Macroeconomics , the most important thing is to understand what you are doing , not just studying all the models given by your text , because the concept are at the base , once you have made them yours you will be able to solve all the exercises without knowing all the models by heart .

I would light to highlight that learning by heart is , in fact , something I do n't really agree with , because I think it is just a loss of time , spendable in a more useful way , also for the long time you need to learn and the short time you use to forget !

It 's true that learning facts is a compulsory part in everyone 's study , absolutely not to avoid if you want to be really prepared , anyway I would like to underline that it is not enough , nor really useful , if you have n't understood what is behind the argument you are studying .

Even if you know all the facts , you have learned all the dates written in your book , if there is a lack of comprehension , in my opinion your study in an useless effort .

When I was young , my grandmother used to repeat me `` what you understand , none will never steal it to you '' : I really believe that a statement like this can support my opinion , because memory is something that can go away in a whisper , but once you got something , you have it .

10251,1667286.txt,P6,FRA,high,"Travelling implies discoveries .
I have myself travelled a lot to different continents , I have however never been in a group directed by a guide .
The good point of having a guide is that everything you look at - the other type of architecture , the other culture , other rituels - are described and explained by the guide .
From what people told me about it , I guess that going on trip with a guide is a more relaxing way to discover new habits than looking by yourself into books to try to understand what is all around you .
Nevertheless , the point of view you get is the one of only one person .

As far as I am concerned , I prefer going to new places without a guide .
I like getting to know the culture by myself .
You take the time to discover .
In consequence , you interfer with the new culture and catch , understand the habits of the people around you .
It 's a more personal approach to the culture .
This point brings my second thought on the subject : I prefer travelling with a friend rather than with a group .

Travelling with a group means that you follow timetables .
You do not see what you necessarily would have liked to see .
Most of all you remain with people who have the same culture .

As a conclusion , my conception of travelling means that you should enter another world .
I come from Paris and lived in India for three months with two friends working in hospitals .
We dressed with the clothes everyone wore , so that people thought at one pointthat we had been living in India for a long time .
The experienced and time spent with people implies that we were three and not a group of fifteen people .
We were no tourists somehow but observers , discoverers , walking , eating with the people who live there .

9988,1621287.txt,P3,JPN,medium,"I agree with this statement .
I am 18 years old , so I can be said one of young people .
Actually I AM the one who do not give enough time to helping one 's commnication .
I moved when I am a elementary school student and I went to non-public school in my junior high and high school days .
So I have not so many people in my city .
Neither do my parents .
I live in an apartment house and have little relative with the resident .
It is said that people live in an apartment house have little frendship nowadays , I think so too .
And more my family including me buy foods in derivary service , so I do n't know about my city 's shops .

Most of young people nowadays may be same as my lifestyle .
Especially if one does not born and bred in the city where one lives now , one have less relative to and pay less attention to their community .
And if one 's parents is familiar to the city where they live , they tend to become less connection to their community .

I also belive that there is another attractive place like standing shoppingmall in the place where they do not live .
So people do not stay in their community and go anothe community .

Of course every young people thesedays do not live like that .
Some have the experience to join the festival , MATSURI or some sports that was held by community , and others have connection to community 's president or some person , therefore they knows a lot about event held by community .

However people like that is not so many .
This is why I belive that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .

10122,1645043.txt,P8,DEU,high,"I totally agree with the opinion that if you want to become or stay successful in your life you have to try new things .
A change in the way of working is not only good for leaders in the company , but also for the people working in the teams and working for you .
If you try different ways to hit your target , you will be able to see different ways to reach your claim .
That implicates also that you will be able to find different ways which can be different to your `` normal '' way of working .
And perhaps sometimes one of these newly found ways works out better for you and your whole company .

If you include the people working for you in the different teams into the process of finding these new ways to work together and for each other , they will enjoy to be asked and will enjoy working for you even more and even better .
You create a corporate identy and everyone will be happier because he has been asked for his opinion .
He is a part of the company and knows that he is important for it and his chief .

The change in the company , the results it brings and the new ways caused by it will show , what is good and what is bad for the daily working .
It will take some time , but you will see the changes the new way brings .
Or if even the traditional way you worked before was and still is the better way .
Going back to the old way is allways possible .

By searching for the best possibilities you gaine opportunities .
You are allways able to decide for the best way for your company .
That means , you are also able to go back to traditional ways and behaviours .
A great chance !

Each company wants to be a famuse one in this time to show what it has of stuff for people .
I disagree with this event for many reasons .
First of all , the are not really productes which some of companies produced , will not stay along time as the orginal one because it made of different stuffs .
The stuffs which they put them in the produced do n't work together .
For example : when there company wants to produces some thing as technology machine and they made it of different stuffs with differnet qualties so , there will be some mistake init .

Second , the products which look like the orginal one is not fine because the qualities that will be in the prodcuts are n't good to stay the machine long time than orignal one .
The reasons to the comanies produce like this stuff that there are many people are not able to buy the orignal one because it 's expansive .
For example : the people with low level education and low salary 's level , they ca n't buy expansive stuff , so they go to the cheap one eventhough , it 's not good qualitiy .

Third , I disagree with the porducts which seem much better tnan the orginal one because the company that made the orginal one spent alot of money to made a great produce to stay long time with the costmires .
it is not fear to be there other way to made same stuff but , low qualitiies level .

11304,1855436.txt,P6,SPA,high,"When people visit unknown places for them , they like to know important things of the place , obtain relevant information about it , etc .
That is why they join a group led by a tour guide , and that way they are sure they will not miss anything of the place they are visiting .
But it is not the only way to travel to unknown places .
That is why there are backpackers , ramblers and day trips .
I am nor a bakcpacker nor a rambler but I think that when you travel with a tour guide your options are considerably limited .

I do not agree with the statement because I think people should have the freedom of finding some more thigs about the place they are travelling to , but on their own .
For example , a tour guide will take you to the most popular places of the city but on the same route he or she takes everybody .
That is , in my opinion , what the problem is : you are being taken to the same places everybody does and then the guide describes it for you in the same way he or she describes it to every single person .
That is where your options begin to decrease in number .

According to that , I think it would be better to visit some places on your own , see what you want to see , know what you want to know and admire what you want to admire .
It is an excellent option since everyone is different and some places may be more worth to visit than some others and so on .
For example when I went to Cartagena this year ( without a guide ) , I did not want to visit the same places everyone visits ; I wanted to go through the `` Old City '' by myself and on foot and in the process I saw some things that cannot be seen with a tour guide because they are not found in well-known places of the city ; one example of it is the contrast between some of the most luxurious restaurants of the city and the poberty just in front of the restaurant 's doors ..
Even though I have not experimented what a trip is with a guide , I am happy visiting what I want in the places I travel to .

To conclude I would like to say that travelling with a tour guide is a monotonus way of travelling , specially if you are looking forward to know not common or unusual but still interesting things of a city .
I think planning your own trip is a way to break that cycle , and everything that breaks the cycle for the better , must be good .

12020,1982148.txt,P4,DEU,high,"Advertisement definitely helps to make products more attractive , even if their actual value does not correspond to the promises made by the advertisement .
It is not very surprising that this is the case .
There is a whole industry dealing only with the task of promoting products .
They employ experts who use the latest psychological knowlegde of how to influence the human perception of a certain product .
Of course a product will become more appealing if it is developed exactely for the target group you belong to .
The advertisement not only tries to sell a product , it tries to sell a lifestyle .
It says , if you drive this car , drink this beer , smoke these cigarettes , you will have a pleasant life , a successful career and more sex than you ever could have dreamt of .
That makes a product look very attractive on a TV screen .
After having bought the article , it often turns out that it does not fulfill all desires that were promised to be fulfilled .
In reality , it looks much less impressive than on the screen and the consumer in fact is rather disappointed .

Another example for advertised products with low quality is fast food , either in a restaurant or from the supermarket .
The advertisement suggests that eating this particular pizza or hamburger is not only tasteful , but also very nourishing .
The TV spot may show a happy family gathered around a table , eating these great five minute noodles .

2405,417007.txt,P7,DEU,high,"Although it is important to gain knowledge of many basic facts , I think that it is really better to acquire understanding of concepts and ideas which are given in lectures and classes .
There are three reasons why I agree with this statement .

The first point I have to mention is that you can look up every fact which you want to know about in books or the Internet .
In addition , this process does not take a lot of time .
For example , when you are asking about a special date , you can use a history book or an Internet site which deals with historical dates .

Second , it is very helpful for your future profession when you have understand the concepts and ideas which are often used in the professional life .
When a special problem occurs you have to solve it using your abilitites you have learned during your studying time .
Think of an instance in mathematics .
When you try to solve an equation to finish the calculations which are very important for your company it is absolutely necessary that you have understand the concept of solving such equations in order to avoid mistakes .

To continue , there is still another reason for my opinion .
When you are confident with the underlying principles of any topic you are , as a result , enabled to unterstand and , probably , to solve new problems .
Imagine the case of a special problem which only emerges in your section .
This problem has to be solved but no known way of approaching this problem is appropriate .
So your combination abilities are very important .
You have now to combine concepts and ideas you have already learned and the new .
Consequently , when you have acquired a great variety of principles to solve problems you will probably be prepared well in creating own , new ideas and concepts .

In summary , from my perspective , it is better for students to gain knowledge of many concepts to be successful in their future professional life .

We can split two methods to learn , one using the facts and one using the ideas and the concepts .
Mainly students at first learns the facts , in fact is more easy for a person store a fact than understand a concept , but sometimes it is not enough to be well prepared for a school test .

Sometimes is nedded to know the ideas and the concepts who are back on the fact , They are more difficoult to learn becouse the person can understand and compare the main ideas of the facts just once a person well know the facts , .

I think that is more important for students to undersdtand the ideas and the concepts than It is for them to learn the facts becouse if You know the ideas and the concepts It mean You well know the facts , and sometimes if You forget the facts You can remember the ideas and than remember the facts .

Anyway , in some particoular situations is better know the facts than understand the ideas and the concepts , It appens rarely for me , for example when I am delaied with my studies and i have a very few time before a test , so i need to study the topic as fast as is possible for me .

For someone It is a common way to study but i think when a person store just the fact He will be not able to remember It in a large scale time , becouse the human 's memory is more able to store ideas and concepts than It is able to store facts for long time .

3130,542386.txt,P2,FRA,medium,"To answer this question , i will organize in two parts .
The first part will explain who i think young people enjoy life more than older people , and ( even if i 'm not so old ) the second part will explain how i think older people can appreciate life more than youngers .

We all remember the first time , the first time we made love , the first time we went to highschool , the first time we smoked a cigarette .
I think this is one of the reasons we might say younger can appreciate life in a more intensive way than the olders , just because everything they do is knew .
Teenage is the period where you hqve lots of experiences , it 's an adventure , you discover all the time .
I remember my teenage .
It was kind of amazing and i think i would never be able to experience the same feelings i 've experienced during this period .
i was always going to partys , when i was 15 me and my freind would go to night club and everything has a important impact on me because it was knew .
An other argument is that young people have no reponsability : they do n't have money problems , or job problems or even children problem , there parents take care of everything so they do n't have to worry about all those things that makes life difficult .

But in contradiction with all that i said before , i would point that maybe older people are able to enjoy life in a better way .
adults have a larger experience witch gives them a knoweledge young people do n't have .
Having this experience they can appreciate things young people woud n't even care about .
It 's hard for me to give exemples because i do n't consider myself as an complete adult .
But maybe adult can enjoy very infime things like a good glass of an old wiskey for exemple .
One day a professor told me : the more you know , the more you like .
I think old people , as they know more about life , can enjoy it even more .

On more point is that young people do n't have the time to establish important projects .
What is life about after all ?
i think life is about being happy and making such as wonderfull things as children .
Adults have the oppurunity to live this kind of wonderfull projects .

Why ?
that depends on the target market that the company or the producer decide for the product .

For example , when you see the Mc Donald 's advertisements , they show you a big and tasty burger , but when you go there and buy it , you realize that this burger is smaller and not that well presented as the one you saw on TV .
In the other hand , when you see a Rolex 's or Cartier 's ad , you see exactly the watch or the product they are selling to you .
Then , when you go to the store , you see the exact same clock or product that they showed you .

When people that watched the Mc Donald 's ad on TV are hungry , their mind can automatically tell them that the burger they saw is a good option for lunch .
But when people is thinking to buy a Rolex watch they want it to be elegant .
If they go to the store and they see that the watch of the adverisement is different from the one in the store , they wo n't buy it .

5066,882610.txt,P8,TEL,medium,"I agree with the statement , `` successful peolpe try new things and take risks rather than doing things what they already know how to do well '' .
I believe that successful people are the ones , who have reached new heights and a stage which others believe is difficullt and hard to obtain .
The idea of being new has always attracted the crowds and only sustained for short time .
If it was not appealing for a long time .
I believe that successful people have always tried to keep the concept of new alive by taking risk and sustanining for long period .

The idea of taking risks to succed has always been repeated in history and in present .
For example GRAYS , the persons who has written the book of human antomy .
Ages ago , during his time it was considerd a sin to dig the corpse and study on it and was not allowed .
He with the passion has risked to go to the graves at night and dig the corpse and get it to his lab and work on it , His book of anatomy is considerd even today the best book of human anatomy ever written .
Thus , making him a successful person , This only happened as he has taken the risk of trying new things than being convential .
sticking to old medicine taught to him at that time .

history has repaeted this kind of examples over and again , for example a buisness man named Mithal , one of the richest person in the world and an owner of the largest steel industries in the world .
He hailed from a family which was very poor and was taught to do buisness only in a small scale but with an envision of new concepts he risked to buy a small steel industry and after that with a new concept of not making a stell industry , insted aquiring industries which are not doing good buisness in the form of colabration has led him to become the owner of largest buisness in the world .
This is only possible by taking a risk of applying a new concept with a vision .

The idea of taking risk and being successful has alsways been constanly rewarding to all the succesful people .
thus i strongly belive that a person taking a risk with agood vision would succed and become a successful person than by sticking to what he knows .

11124,1823886.txt,P2,JPN,high,"I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people .
When people are young they always want to challenge things , and are very energetic .
However older people have to work , to maintain their lifestyle and has already become calm .
Therefore I believe young enjoy life more than older people .
I will explain my reasons in the following essay .

Young people are always trying to do new things so they are very active which makes them enjoy their life .
Generally young people dont have to think about others and just think about their own life .
Therefore they can do whatever they want to do .
For instance , if they want to go on a trip just to disocover something , they can do it easily .
However if they get older and have a family to support , it will become difficult for them to do so .
When people are young they have many chances and opportunities to change their future lives .
Thus they can just do what they want to do .
And when people do what they want to do , they enjoy their lives to the fullest .

Older people generally already have a job and some have families .
Therefore it makes them hard for them to have the time to do their hobbies , or to travel .
And to support their families , they have to make a lot of money so it is not easy to quit their jobs just to challenge their dreams .
Older people cannot just do what they want to do because it would affect many other things .
As they in a stricted situation , it is difficult for them to enjoy their lives .

In my opinion , young people enjoy life more than older people do .
It is very difficult for older people to do what they want to do because it effects other things such as their family .
However young people dont have to think about those things and can challenge whatever they want to do .
Therefore I believe young people enjoy life more than older people .

8747,1380243.txt,P1,ITA,high,"I disagree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowdledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject , because today a specialization is more useful than a broad knowdledge .
However , it depends on the kind of job you want to do ; for a children 's teacher , for example , perhaps it is better to have a broad knowledge .

If you are specialized in one specific subject , only you and other few people are able to understand this subject in deep , and so some people will look for you and your knowdledge .
Think about me : I am studying Material Science and Engineering ; I have n't a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , but if someone has problems concerning with materials , I am the person for him and I will be payed lots of money for my suggestions .
Thus , specializing is a good way to have better chances in finding work .

Otherwise you must n't be an ignorant in the other subjects , because you are required to know what are you talking about , when you are speaking with another person .
For example , if someone speaks to me about gears or engines at work , I have to know how they work properly , more or less .
Also if someone ask me an information about an important philosoper like Barouch Spinoza , I am supposed to know something about him .

However , I think that this broad knowdledge should been given to students by High Schools , and not by the University .
If you have done your High School properly , you are supposed to have enough broad knowdledge to support all the discussion you will take in the future .

Thus , in my opinion it is better to attend the High School in a good way in order to achieve a broad knowdledge of many subjects , and then specialize in what you like the most when you are going to the University .

11169,1830781.txt,P4,SPA,high,"I strongly believe that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .
In my opinion , the main cause for this being so is that that 's precisely the aim of advertisments .

During the 20th century , the approach on selling products have shifted from believing that having a good product was enough to sell it , to believing that aggresive marketing was a must .

This means that nowadays companies believe that having a good product is not enough , but that you must make the public aware of your product and convince it of how good your product actually is .
But , why is n't enough to show a good product as it really is ?
Simply because such an approach would n't make most products stand out in the wide varierty of products now available .
Let 's look , for example , at washing machine 's soaps : every company , from Ariel to Ala , claim their soap is tremendously better than any other competitor .
Or car manufacturer 's : every single brand states their cars are the fastest and most secure cars in the market .
Clearly , all of them ca n't be right .
Most of them must be making their products seem much better than they really are .

Another way of seeing that advertisments make products seem better than what they trully are is thinking about this : When was the last time you heard an advertisment state any disadvantege to their products , any weak points ?
I do n't think I ever did .
But clearly , products have weak points and disadvantages .
Even if all good things advertisments say about their products are true , those products are n't likely to be perfect , so by stating the good things and hiding the not so good ones , they are making their product look better than what it actually are .

This can be understand if we keep in mind that advertisments aim at selling products , and so will do everything possible to convince customers of buying them , without attempting to provide an objective view .

In conclusion , most advertisments make products look better than they really are , and this can be seen in the fact that most of them claim their products to be the best in the market and fail to mention any weak those products may have .

2453,425931.txt,P5,JPN,medium,"I agree with the statement which says that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today because I think that the transportation system such as trains or busses will be developed more than now .
Even now , in the big citys , people use trains or busses more than cars .
Maybe people think convinient to use transportations better than using a car because of dense of the people and cars .
Nobody likes the rush hours and everybody wants to avoid it .

The other reason I agree with the statement is the think of environment .
It is a serious problem the mount of CO2 the bunch of cars make .
I guess and I hope that people will care about environment more and for that , using cars is not so good way .
If many people use trains of busses instead of cars , much of CO2 is reduced .

One more last reason I agree with the statement is the cost of the car .
To have a car costs much because of gas , insuluence , maintaince , and itself .
Because of these costs , I think in next twenty years , the number of the people who use the cars will reduce .
And also , it is more healthy than cars because it makes peole stand and walk .

These are the reasons why I agree with the statement which says that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
However , of course , there are many good points about cars .
It is convinient , useful , and for some people , it 's cool to have it .
Moreover , transportations such as busses and trains also have many problems such as the rush time or times it takes .

9600,1549033.txt,P2,TEL,medium,"`` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' , I agree with this statement because young people are more enthusiastic than the older people .
As it is the time for the young people to enjoy they should rock their life , cant find time to enjoy when they are old .

The older people hardly find time to enjoy as they are busy with their work , thus young people enjoy their life .
For example consider young people they have lot of time to enjoy with their cousins and friends , but older people meet with thier cousins when they attend party .
Thus Young people enjoy life more than older people do .

Young people , while they are busy with their academics , still find time to enjoy i.e in holidays .
Young people get holidays after their completion of course ( i.e one or two months ) .
But older people do not get much holidays to enjoy , if they for a leave they get only few day i.e hardly one week .
For example , young people enjoys a lot on their holidays by going to movies , rocking with friends , attending parties and going tour in their vacation , but older cant do this as they dont find time .
Thus young people enjoy life more than older people do .

Hence considering the above points we can say that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Thus young people find more time to enjoy their life than older people .
So , young people should enjoy their life to maximum extent as they can not enjoy when they are old .

11782,1939513.txt,P1,JPN,medium,"For long as the college exsits in the society , the professors and students have debated whether having many academic knowledge would be better or having spacialize ones .
The issue may not be resolved be everybody 's satisfaction the answer is crystal-clear in my mind ; Taking many academic subjects will be the best for your edcucation .

That many academic subjects are better for education is eveident for several reasons .
First , when you are educated in school or some institute , in most cases the studenets goal in the future are vague .
In this kind of situatiation the students will need variety of informations which lead his future to be very attractive .
To illustrate , my sister who is in college have not decided her job after school .
However she is now taking the many academic class to broaden her knowledge and also make herself well-balanced charactor which will lead for her future goals .
Second , by taking many academic subjects you will get to know with varaiety of freinds whose background and thoughts are different .
For example , the college I had graduate offers many academic subjects in freshman .
After ten years has past , the friends I got in that timing are still very good friends and influenced me .

Nevertheless , some critics may contend that specific subjects will be more effective to edcucate the workers for specific jobs such as lawyer , enginner , physicia among others .
However , recent graduate school recrute more well-balanced students from other areas .
My brother who had been working as a sales rep for computer finally could get in to graduate school for doctor .
They requires the applicants who have taken many academics subjects from under graduate schools and can talk and listen with his patients very carefully .
In view of this to take many academic subjects overweigh the experience to take specialize ones .

In conclusion .
manay academic subjects will make the person to have more potential to reach and decide he/her goal as well as providing well balanced personality that recently requires as a matured adult in whatever jobs in society .

4739,826995.txt,P4,SPA,medium,"I think that the advertisement is what really push you to buy something that you need , or think you may need .
Because of the way the product is showed .
Some advertisements show just the product advantages , but does not show the disadventages , so the client or the posible clients ( you ) are convince that is what you need , without serch for others products that offert the same porpuse but in differrents ways .
Some times we buy before do any research in differents products of the same kind .

The price is something that really makes the difference , because if bysides the advertisement shows just the adventages and it has a really low price in compare with other products of the same kind , that really influens your desitions , because you always want to save some money , at least if you are a normal status person .

The advertisements are good to show you the differents kinds of products you can find in the market for a certain porpuse , always if they tell you the trurth .
Some companies just made their advertisements incompleated , as I said before they show you just the good part of the product , and sometimes they overfull you of their advertisements , so you will make your desition based on what you seen more often , You get to tell youself `` if you see it every where it most be good , so I will buy it '' .

That is what push us to make mistakes , we can not leave our desition on the companie 's hands , we have to do some research to make sure that what they are offering is what really is , and what I really need , otherwise you do not need to buy it .

So my adventage is that always make sure the product you are buying it what you think it is , you can check with friends of yours that had bougth it , or with different stores that sale it , do not let the advertisement convince you .

10277,1670687.txt,P4,HIN,medium,"I think that in today 's world even if a product is of excellent quality and is very useful , it still needs to be advertised in order to reach its sales potential .
Having said this I completely agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
There are couple of main points I want to state here in support of my conclusion .

First , there is no way for the consumers to validate the claims being made about a product in advertisement .
The only way to figure out if the claims are right is by actually using the product or talking to others who have used the product .
The advertiser of the products exploit the dificulty faced by consumers in validation the product related claims , by making claims which have no suppoting evidence .

The best example of this is the claims made by many of the weight reduction pills on the market .
The advertisements claim that the pills will reduce weight by 50 to 100 ponds in couple of weeks .

Second point is the fact that the advertisers use well know celebrities to advertise and market bad quality products .
Just because a is acting in an advertisement for a product does not mean the product is good .
Most of us know this fact .
But association of the celebrity with the product does seem to influence peoples buying decisions .
This tells us that even though the product is not of the best quality , the advertisement made it seem good just because it has a celebrity cast .
For example in India the superstar actor Amitabh Bachhan acts in so many advertisements for products which are bad in quality , but just because he is part of the advertisements the products are baught by many people .

Consequently , there is controversy issue over the topic : what kind of people enjoy life more : old peple or young people ?
Some people think old people enjoy life more ; while others insist that young people enjoy life more .
As for me , the choice , nevertheless , is not easy to make .
After considering my fondness and personalities , i choose the latter .
As one of the famous saying goes in the country : young people are the masters of games .
In the following disccusion , i would like to reason and provide evidence for my point of view .

First of all , young people have more activities to play with like : they can climb mountains , skate , swim and so on .
For example , on New Years Eve , i went to skate in the city hall , and we had a lot of fun .
However , not much of old people went to skate .
One of the reasons is that their heath conditions do not allowthem to do so .

Secondly , young people are more enthusiastic .
They are willing to try really exiciting games .
For example , last year , my brothers went to poji .
It a game that people jump from a high mountain really quickly like about several minites .
Your heart should be tolerated enough to overcome the scary .
According to a statistic conducted by University of Toronto , 95.47 of the people who play the poji is young people .

Admitedly , old people enjoys life in certain circumstances .
For instance , they walk dogs and have tea together .
But those activities are limited and not much fun compare to young peoples activities .
So that is i think the better choice should be that young people enjoy life more .

There are still a lot of reasons for my fondness of that young people enjoy life more .
The obvious ones have provides as above .
In conclusion , that why i think youngpeople enjoy life more .

3050,528486.txt,P8,HIN,high,"I aree only partially with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they do well .
Although , trying newer things keeps up the growth graph and helps a person to rise above the rest but equally true is the fact that one can be equally successful in some thing in which he or she has both , experience and expertise .

To excel in any field , its extemely crucial to know ones job correctly and efficiently .
This excellence can be achieved by hard work and spending more time on the job at hand .
In other words , experience and diligence is the key to success .
For this reason , I belive that those people who do the same thing over a long period of time or do it well , do become successful .
For example , a mechanic specializing in repairing electronic gadgets can achieve enough success even if he sticks to that very job forever .
People shall always trust him more than the neophytes in the profession .
However , if he changes his job or tries to multitask in more number of jobs , he might end up spoiling his established work and not even getting the customer 's support in the new area in which he will now become a beginner .

However , trying out different things in life cannot be seen with any contempt .
It is always said that if you stop growing , you would soon start declining .
Staying in just one thing and doing nothing else can easily stagnate a person and stagnant water is worth nothing more than a breeding place for mosquitoes and deadly diseases .
Therefore , it is as proper to keep experimenting in life .
One should always learn newer and better stuff and become adroit in them .
At the same time , one must never forget to keep in touch with the original talent and maintain it .

Conclusively , Whether you decide to stay in your discipline , or diversify , success can be all yours , provided , you do it with sincerity and hardwork .

2892,501161.txt,P3,ZHO,high,"I totally agree with the statement that the young people today really do n't spend enough time helping their communities .
And that is also what I do n't want to see and expect .
In the following disscusion , I will present the reasons which cause the result and how to solve the problem .

The first reason why the young people today do n't give time to help their communities is that there are more and more things attract them .
When the young students are after class , they may do some activities with their friends such as shoping or something like that .
The beautiful clothes in the department stores or the popular video games in the club may attract them .
That means that they will pay more attention on what they like and spend more time on what they are intereted in .
So that is why the young people do not give enough time to help their communities .
There are lots of things they want .
It makes sence that they may forget some other important things such as the communities stuff .

The second reason is that the most young people tend to take the material they have for granted .
They do not appreciate it because they think that they deserve it .
So maybe they will think that the communities stuff is not their business and they do n't have to take the responsibility for it .

Toward this problem , I think the best solution is education .
We have to teach the young people about their duty of helping their communities .
A good community is based on many people 's effort .
We have to let them know that they are also the part of the communities .
So they should spend enough time toward it no matter what reasons they have .
To be more specific , let me give an example to explain more clearly .
Each of us all belongs to a family .
So who should spend time on the household things .
I think that you will say each member in the family should spend time on them .
And that is what I want to say .
Just like this example , each member in the community should give enough time to help their communities because they are the members in the communities .

T sum up , I agree that in today 's society , young people really spend less time to help the communities .
And the reasons why is just like what I mention above .
What we can do is try our best to teach them about the importance of the participation in the communities .

6715,1088250.txt,P1,HIN,high,"In my opinion it is better to have knowledge of one specific subject extensively , rather than having some knowledge in all the fields .
There are a few reasons namely - accuracy , dangers of half knowledge and specialization is only after some general knowledge - that i venture to opine in favour of specialization .

Firstly if a person is more widely knowledgable in the field of his own interest , he not only performs well but also is able to put in his own efforts in the form of information to be used more accurately .
For example a doctor , if he is specialized in heart and its related aspects he is capable of helping a patient more efficiently than a general physician would .

Secondly like i said dangers of half knowledge are not unknown to us .
If we have not mastered even one subject we can not put in any effort to get something out of our knowledge .
We do not have a sense of direction in which to proceed also we have to stop in the middle of an invention or discovery because we do not know what lies ahead .
This can also be decisive for the growth of a society on the whole .

Finally for any specialization to happen on any subject we start with a knowledge of various feilds related or unrelated which might help in the better understanding our field of interest so the knowledge of all academic subjects is in a way the foundation stone of any specializaion and is therefore a part of the learning process .
Like i stated if it is a cardiologist in question then he would have some knowledge of the whole body functioning as that is evidently related .

Thus i can safely say that specialization not only helps in developing our skills in our own field of interest , it also is the destination for some knowledge that we acquire in all the subjects .
Eventually helping us to mature as an individual , as an adroit in our field and in the growth of society on the whole .

Recently i went my home town and met my friends .

At that time i had to talk about history of world richest culture .
They talking well but i could not even talk a single word .
At that moment i feel very bad and thought that if u have knowlege about some other topics i definitely able say something .

We are living in interdependent society that means we have to help others and take help from others , we must know about our duties and responsebilities and some famous persons .
It requires to know about some subjects those are knowlege about history and geography and political sciences and knowledge about some biology .
Last year summer college a big accedent occur .
At that time i and my frined were near by .
we do n't immediately what to do , what i mean is to make a phone call to police station .

6052,1030588.txt,P8,JPN,low,"If the `` success '' means economical or scientifical success ( big money or new deveropment ) , I agree with the statement .

So relatively comfortable life can be achieved by the routine task , or work .
It means new chalanges are not necessory for common life , so many people seem not to like trying new matters .
The chalanges is more impotant now !
In the field of science , new result only derived from new chalanges or ideas .
Already known works only make already known results .
In the economical sense , also new chalange sometimes makes big success .
But economical chalanges always bring some risks and easily become gamble , so we should manage our total risk .

But l think it is also important to keep the traditional matters , theorys and caltures .
They can be the basis of new one .

Actually it 's true that understand ideas and concepts are important for students .
However , even the students have those things , I think the learning does not work without the learning facts for the students .

When I was in Grade 7 and 8 , I could not success with my study that much , because I did not try to study hard at the time .
However , I was changed my mind by my mother 's words when I was in Grade 9 .
And I could think that I have to study and if I study I will get good marks than before .
Since then I studied hard , and my effort was permitted from my teachers .
And my marks was getting high like I have ever seen or I could not imagine before .
When I got the report card from those teachers , they wrote some masseges for my mother about me on the report .
And it said `` she changed a lot in this year .
I knew that she is a person who have good unerstanding knowlegdes and nice learner , but she did n't try to work hard before .
So her marks were low , but she tried to study so hard in this year .
I felt she grew up little bit , and I am glad to see her many great ideas and imaginations and also I felt her good attitudes in those classes .
I learned from your daugnter that even if we have good qualities , if we did n't think we want to show the qualities , the good qualities never get Great qualities . ''
When I saw the massages , I felt so happy and I thought I will keep studying hard for me , my family who support me , and those teachers who I got when I was in Junior High .

5588,981128.txt,P5,TUR,high,"Today , the major means for transportation is automobile .
Especially in Europe and America , a family may own up to 4 cars for a household of four people .
When added together , it makes a whole lot of cars out there .
But the main reason behind this is that owning a car is the most convenient way to get around , and since it is private property , you can use it anytime you want .
I believe that the number of cars may decrease in twenty years ' time for some reasons .

The first reason is more like sci-fi .
As we are introduced to a new technology everyday , it is plausible enough to dream of a different means of transportation as convenient and private as a car , such as private helicopters .
I have to admit twenty years may not be long enough for scientists to invent small enough helicopters that would fit the roofs of suburban houses .
But as I said , it is plausible , at least to me .

The more solid reasons why I believe that there will be fewer cars in near future concern ecological , demographic and environmental issues .
It is already obvious that the world is becoming over-populated , especially at city centers .
At such places , the traffic is jammed more than anywhere else .
Dangerous gases that cars produce not only pollute the air , they also affect the course of climates , changing .
They also harm the health of people .
It could be argued that we can get rid of the pollution by using fuels other than gas , but the problem of traffic would still remain , hence it would not be a complete solution .
Concerned scientists and engineers are already thinking about ways to lessen the number of cars .
One good way to do that is to establish better means of public transportation : wide enough to reach anywhere a person may want to go at all hours of the day .
Such a solution would avoid traffic jams and cause less air pollution .

With a good public transportation , especially if it costs cheaper than gas , people would be encouraged to use it instead of cars .
Hence , the number of cars would decrease in near future .
I believe this change will take place in near future and we will hopefully see less cars on the roads .

3428,594557.txt,P5,TUR,medium,"There are some fluctuations in usage of some items while the time pass and the technolgy improves .
Some people thinks in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , but I do not think so .

There are some items which their usage is decrasing day by day because of the improving technology .
They replaced by their improved ones , like walkmans .
In the past , we listen music by walkmans very often but nowadays we prefer mp3 players that are more easy to use and have high music storage capacity .
Like walkman , cars are improving every day but they are not replaced by another trasport vechile .
People still need cars for trasportation , but ofcourse with newer modals are preferd .

In Turkey in 1970s , every family has maximum only one car .
Because there are very small production of cars in Turkey and it is very expensive to buy a car .
In general people has not enough power to purchuase a car .
Moreover having a car is not very nesscesry for every one because cities were not as big as today .
Throughout the passing years , our country becomes to have better financial power and production quantity of cars increase while their prices are decreasing .
So now nearly all famillies has a car and some of them has more than one .
The reason for having h'gher amount of car is not only the low prive , in todays world every individual needs to own a car for fast and easy trasportation .

4759,829846.txt,P3,FRA,medium,"I agreed that Young people do not give enough time to help in any communities which they find themself or belong .
Young people of nowadays are so much occupied with alot of activities .
Young people spend alot of thier time in doing irrelevant things such spending alot of time on the internet , playing computer games and other activities .

Young people of nowadays believed that this is world in which everybody has to minds his or her own business so there is no importance in focusing in ths issue of another person .

They belived that helping communities is an old people work because they have alot of goals to achieve in there life time so maybe when they get old someday they could help their community .

Young people also belived that they needed money to help thier community becauce they they do not have enough fund to contribute to the project lay down by the commuinity so they tend to step back .

I can also state some student do not have time to help the community because they do not have necessary time to do that .
Imagine an undergraduate student who is enroll as full time student , after the classes , he has to study perhaps need to do extra jobs to assist himself financially .

Yong people of nowaday believe that community has nothing to offer them while should they spend thier time helping the community instead they prefer to go to night club and have fun with their friends .

Most of the younth are ignorance of the word , contribution to the community , they do not have the necessary informations on what is meant by helping thier communities .
In conclusion i will note that young people of nowadays are not giving enough time to help thir communities base on the points made above .

2597,451067.txt,P2,ZHO,high,"I do n't agree with that statement .

In my opinion , enjoying life does n't relate to the age directly .
Of course , usually a young person can make an advantage of his youthful and healthy body .
He can do more extreme sport activities , like snowboarding , surfing or bumgee-jumping .
But more often young people are not that independent as they wish to be .
Most young people need financial support from their parents , especially during the studying time at unversity .
That means one has to explain the expediture exactly to the parents every time one needs money .
That can be very exhausting and demotivating .

After university , financial worries decrease on the one hand , but on the other hand concerns on the job arise .
As a rule , the first years on the job are the most stressful ones which are accompanied by immense pressure to establish oneself in the new company .

Thus , I think that the thirty-somehows can enjoy life better than the younger people .
Those people usually have already gained acknowledgement in the job world and in society .
Moreover , they are financially independent and do n't have to fight for the career that intensly .
As a result , that group of people can spend more time for their hobbys and their family .

Older people are also enjoying life , because they have more experience .
I think they know how to appreciate the real things and values in life and are more confindent .

11657,1920142.txt,P4,KOR,low,"I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

Whenever , I watch the television I always face to a lot of advertisement .
they keep give me a information that i do n't know .

first , the most important goal of the advertisement is promoting the sales .
How can they acheive this goal ?
they have to attract cosumer .
In order to see the information about that we need to see the aim of businessman .
It may be fulfiled by giving good information to them .

If they success for catching the consumer 's eye , it is evaluated very succesful adverisement .
most advertiser 's concerning is catching the consummer .
so it is no wonder that they inform their product very well .

Second , advertiser want to their product is showed diffrent from the other .
Studies has showed that people tend to like beutiful things .
They prefer person who is charming .
It is very important not only human but also product .

In my experience , I want to buy mp3 player so I gathered information internet and advertisement .
Finally , I decide what I want , then I went to the electronic shopping mall .
It was quite disappointed when I went to the shopping mall and saw the real one .
Most of all , the function that refer to the advertisement does n't work .

3835,665398.txt,P7,TUR,high,"This is an intricate subject for me , yet I will try to elucidate it .
Many students think that if there is a more free and intellectual environment in the universities , they can be more successful and creative .
On the other hand , other students claim that there is no need much more intellectual level education , if univesity can provide enough knowledge for surviving life , it 's ok .
In this context , I support the former idea for the following reasons .

One of the strongest reasons in favor the approach undestanding ideas and concepts more important for students is that the economic and social system have been transforming to more elligible form for the knowledge society .
As a result of this , If you have not catched the changing , your knowledge based on facts will be old in short time .

Another reason is that there was not much more crucial focusing on research and development studies and innovation in the agricultural and industrial societies .
However , reasearch and development and innovation are the major determiners of global economy , so they are feeding new ideas and concepts .
If you are inside the novelty , you can have changing the world .
That 's why , we must locate on the side of new ideas an concepts .

Lastly , production centers have been shifting from industrial zones to science and technoparks .
Economical system has been gradually adapting the science and technology .
The major supporters of science and technology are new ideas and concepts .
For this reason , so many venture capital firms emerged .
What does it provide us ?
If we have a original , creative and useful idea , we are able to be successful in the less time .

All things considered , I come to notion that there are three reasons why I support the idea undestanding ideas and concepts more important than learning facts .
Firstly , we have lived in the knowledge society , so we must have the knowledge for our whealty .
Secondly , new economy has based on new ideas and concepts .
Thirdly , the new economical structure can provide new opportunuties if we have creative ideas and concepts .

8002,1235866.txt,P8,JPN,high,"I agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
People learn things from thier own mistakes , in order to be successful , we have to face new obstacles and overcome them rather than just doing what we know and not gaining anything .

First of all , all advertising companys create new product and see how we react to it even though they might loose some money for producing it .
By knowing how humans react , they can get better sense of how the product works for us .
They might need to improve more on the product , or they are really helpful and we might need them .
By creating the new product , they get idea of how it works for us .

In addition , computers and all mechanical things are part of our life .
We need them in our everyday life .
It needed lots of patience to create computers and telephones to make them really convenient .
People tried new things that work the best for us and computers are now big part of our society .
Humans cannot live without them , it is a source of connecting this world into smaller places .

Lastly , Martin Luther King Jr. fought for equall right , he believed that all men are created equall .
We can now live safely and peacefully because of his action .
His speech moved lots of people , gave opportunity for others to fight for their own rights .
He no longer exists but he is known for one of the successor in our life .

It takes lots of risk and courage to try new things but that is how people learn things , starts to know importance of taking risk .
For instance , learning foreign language will be challenging for sure but pains we experience will turn into courage and we learn to be more confident and successful .
We each should try new things and prepare for some risks in order to grow ourselves as a person .

10609,1729641.txt,P1,ZHO,high,"In modern society , we always face the dilemma whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subjects .
It is such a debated problem in that it effects everybody in our life .
According to different backgrounds , people may have quite different choices .
Some may frown to it , because they think if they specialize in one specific subject , they can achieve more success , .
While others may say yes , since they perfer to contact with all kinds of knowledge .
When it comes to me , I tend to agree with the second opinion , that is , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .

To start with , broad knowledge is quite essential in social communication .
There is no denying that human are social beings , we need to communicate with others .
But it takes all sorts to make a world , some are teachers , some are doctors , and others may be scientists .
If we have no knowledge of other fields except your own learning area , it can be quite different to makes friends with them .
You may even do not know how to start a conversation , it can be quite frustrated .

Besides communication , there is another important point .
In certain times , some knowledge in other area is needed in our daily life .
Last summer , I went to a small town near the ocean with several friends .
We was deeply moved by the beautiful scenery there , the beach is always full of sunshine .
We loved to relax ourselves on the beach when the sun is setting sun , the breeze is blowing and seabirds are singing .
We went to a seafood restaurant nearby , the seafood there can be the best in the world .
But at this time , my friend felt quite uncomfortable .
At first all of us did not know what was wrong , suddenly I reminded a medcine book I have read before .
I happened to know that he seemed to be allergetic to this kind of seafood .
So I went to the clinic and bought the right medcine for him .
You see , sometimes these knowledge can be quite useful

`` It is always benefical to open a book '' as the old saying says , similarly , it is always benefical to gain knowledge , it can help us to know more about ourselves as well as this world .
So that this plant will be a better place to live in .

Based the discussion above , knowledge which is a integrel part in our life should always be required by human beings no matter which kind of knowledge .

4928,859886.txt,P7,TUR,medium,"I do not agree with the statement that ` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts` .

I dont think that you can understand ideas or concepts of something when you do not learn the facts .
Facts are more important than ideas .
They should both know the facts and concepts about something so they can analyse the situation themselves .
They can not know something by not learning the facts .
They can not be completely concious about a subject if they do not know the fact .
The only thing they know is the ideas about it .

I also think that just understanding concept and not learning fact , do not encourage students to observe or investigate .
We all just learn to understand others ' ideas .
Maybe i would not agree with those ideas if i had known more about it .
You can not ask questions about things that you dont know what the facts is .
Hence just understanding ideas will not let us asking questions .

Mostly in history lesson we only understand ideas or concepts about lots of things that we can never be sure if it is the truth or not .
Also i know it is hard to know all facts about history but i just wish i could .

Beside all those above by thinking as the meanings .
Fact means something totally objective and can not be changed .
However idea is opinions of other people and mostly are subjective .
The facts are always objective .
So it is more reliable .

To put it in a nutshell for being more objective , asking more questions about and making the situation more understanable for ourselves we should learn the facts .

10010,1624740.txt,P3,ARA,high,"As unfortunate as it may sound , there is no doubt that it is true .
`` Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities , '' but why is that ?
What has changed in the principles and morals being preached to adolescents over the last decade or more ?
In reality nothing has changed , except for today 's previously unseen rapid adancement and development in the technology sector of society creating a world of technocratic countries .

Young people are really the victims of this technology-centered lifestyle , because they are the primary consumers of video games , computers , and listening devices .
Engulfed in their own world of entertainment , teenagers do n't care anymore about the slums and the sub-standard education that many of their country 's citizens are experiencing .
Today , what 's constantly on a teenager 's mind is whether or not his parents are going to buy him a Playstation for his or her birthday and not what he or she can do to help society .
Therefore , high-tech advertisement has created a highly capitalist consumer culture , which does not allow for adolescents time to think about their surroundings or world issues .

In regard to advertisement , television is its best and most common means of transfer .
Television as Neil Postman has said , is gradually corroding our once highly regarded societal values .
The discourse of television is quick and entertaining , introducing you to the world 's problems in an entertained manner and thereby rendering them as far away dilemmas with no conern what so ever to the person watching .
For example , a person might watch a news reel describing the high amount of toxic fumes in his or her area , but they would'nt do anything about it , because the advertisement following the alleged seriousness of the news cast puts infront of its audience a brand new Xbox .
Now the concern of the teenager is to find ways that could get him or her that Xbox .
What happened to the toxic fumes story ; it just becomes something he or she heard .

Technoloogy is quickly eliminating the importance of family and societal values .
As a result of globalization it is practically impossible now to hault the growing self-centerdness that is characterizing more children .
Children are growing up and all they see around them is fun and entertainment , even when one has the urge to turn serious and turn on the news cast all he or she encounters is another form of entertainment .
Therefore , with entertainment so easily accessable , then it would make sense that teenagers or `` young people '' would become engulfed in a bubble world of their own , where the problems of society are nonexistant to them .

8380,1311869.txt,P3,TEL,medium,"Now a days young people are affected by many aspects of the society , so that they ca n't able to help their communites .
I agree with the statement by the following reasons that , because of their education system , extra curricular activities and affect of media etc .

Firstly , I could discuss about education system .
In my country our education system makes all students so busy all the day .
They are busy with their tight schedules of classes and study hours .
They do n't even have a minute to spend time with their parents .
As a graduate student I am also facing the same problem .
So that they do n't have time to help the communities .

Secondly , young people are used to spend their time by extra caricular activities , for example playing sports , participating in seminars , giving paper presentations and attending conferences that are realted to their education .
All these factors makes them so busy .
I also used to attend the seminars and conferences when I get a free time .

Finally , media has its great impact on youth .
For example television , internet , magazines and TV channels .
All these factors are attracting the youth .
So that they are wasting their time by spending their lot of valuable time to watch TV , using internet etc .
One of my friends , who was also my classmate , addicted to internet browsing and chatting .
He spent most of his time by chatting with his friends .
Therefore he spoiled his carrier by neglecting his studies .
This incident shows how the youth are inclined to unnecessary things and not showing their interest in helping communities .

All these factors indicates that youth are spending their time for their personal activities .
However , some of them used to participate in some social welfare activities , such as helping poor people and orphans .

I conclude , that most of the youth use their time for their own purposes rather than helping their communities .
So that I agree with the statement that , `` Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities '' .

8296,1293173.txt,P7,HIN,high,"It has been said that knowledge and free thinking form the basis of any successful society .
The maxim completely describes todays world which has seen a tremendous desire to achieve milestones previously unimaginable .

For any society to grow we require an understanding of previous knowledge and also an account of our past achievements .
But would it not cause stagnation if the sole purpose of learners was to be aware of these facts and learn them ?
Progress can only be made if we analize our past and learn from them .
Analizing can only come through a proper understanding of ideas and concepts .
Luckily throughout history we have seen mavericks , be it Galileo or Newton or even someone as recent as Einstein , who went against the tide to come up with ideas that allowed the next generations to flourish .

Were it not for our unending thirst for knowledge we would still be living in the stone age .
This is self evident fron the way kids grow and learn from their surroundings .
A baby may never learn how to walk or talk if its brain did not possess the ability to grasps the required steps involved in this complex process .
In this case it may be understanding subconsciously but if we want a robot to simulate the actions of a child we would first require a complete understanding of the involved steps .
Only after this can we put newer ideas into making machine emulate man .

As students it is much more important to understand ideas and concepts during our college years .
This is the time when we not only learn new things but also contribute to the society as a whole .
Be it in any field ; even activities like dancing and singing have evolved over time due to our constantly changing approaches .
Our world today is a technological world and needs constant changes owing to the ever increasing demands .
Computers are becoming increasingly comlpex and faster at the same time .
The computer was invented because of someones tremendous visions but little would he have realized its sinificance in todays world .

We students are the new work force of the future and are aware of the needs of todays world .
Despite all the progress we have made we suffer from difficulties in all countries rich or poor .
Our understanding of the world , its people and the interrelations have just evloved .
Yes we do require facts to account for the details and observations we have made .
But it would serve no purpose if it is not backed up with proper interpretaion and newer ideas to better our future .
Our future , thus , depends on how well we understand ideas and concepts and come out with newer ones .

10553,1721491.txt,P4,ARA,medium,"I agress with the statment made here .
Advertisment are a tool that businesses use to promote a product .
It is ofcourse quite obviuos then that they will only show the positive side of a product in an an attempt to get a customer to buy it .
It is not in their best interest to be honest .
Businesses live by the fact that they are legally allowed to lie .
Any advertisment has the purpose of selling .
If business were truthfull about what they were selling product sales would decrease significantly .

Lets take for example ciggeratte advertisments .
Ciggerates are bad for your health .
In todays world you will not find anyone to argue with this statment and be able prove their oppinion .
So how do you advertise for a product like ciggerates ?
How do you convince people to buy something that kills them ?
Clearly ciggerate manufacturers have thought about this greatly and have come up with the best answer .

Psychology .
Advertisments capitilise on human psychology understandings .
An honest ciggerate commercial would cause people to avoid the product .
So therfore Advertisers learn about human psychology and how to attract people to something they know is bad .
They highlight the package that comes with smoking rather than the ciggerate itself .
There is'nt a ciggerate commerical out there that convinces you to buy their product because of its taste or its feel .
They get you buy it by showing you the social and status rewards of smoking their brand .
Like Davidoff and its elegance .

So when people see advertisments they sometimes remember only its social effects rather than the product itself .
To me thats how advertisments can make a product seem better than it acutally is .

4146,719207.txt,P5,DEU,high,"Today , we are facing serious environmental threats resulting from the excessive use of cars .
Passing a gas station demonstrates us daily that gas prices are increasing tremendously .
Also on a day-to-day basis , the media tells us about political conflicts mostly resulting from oil issues in the Middle East .
Thus , it may lead us to the question if the invention of the car was a good idea .
Moreover , it is intersting to think about the question if there will be as many cars as today in twenty years from now .
I do not think so for the reasons I would like to give in this essay .

First , oil resources are deminishing very rapidly and statistics show that we will eventually run out of oil and gas .
This , of course , depends on the pace we are using our oil .
But it seems very obvious that the vast oil reserves will be totally gone in twenty years if we use oil as we us it today .
Thus , as there will be no fuel in the future there will certainly be fewer cars as well .

Second , the car as we use to know it now is probably going to dissappear .
Technology develops at a such quick pace that there will be new facilities which will transport us and our goods in the future .
Twohundred years ago , people thought that the train is going to be the new vehicle of the future .
However , as the car was invented , trains were not the only transportation means anymore , thus resulting in a decrease of trains being used .
In the same way , it might be happen with the automobile .
Even today , cars are not used that often anymore when cheap airplane tickets become more and more available .

Lastly , I believe that the need to get from one point to the other will be not as high as it is today .
In twenty years , computer technologies will have advanced in such a tremendous way that almost everything will be possible to do from home .
This trend can already be seen today , as many companies are offering jobs that can be done from home using the Internet .
Thus , people will not leave their house in the future as they do now and can leave their car , if the vehicle is still named as such , in their garage .

In conclusion , I feel that it is obvious from the arguments given above that there will be tremendously less cars in the future .
Moreover , it is impossible to say if such a vehicle will still exist in twenty years from now .

3179,551177.txt,P2,DEU,high,"All people enjoy life , and they show this by participating in many of life 's amazing activities .
People enjoy life in many forms .
Yet , people do not lose this thirst for life as they grow older .
The things people enjoy might change with time , but this does not mean that they derive less enjoyment from them .
Improvements in healthcare have made old people 's lives easier and they have also increased their mobility , allowing them to pursue many activities during their retirement .
People enjoy life regardless of age , and this dismisses the statement that `` young people enjoy life more than old people '' .

Of course there are differences between the young and the old .
The young are typically more active and less patient .
Yet , this does not imply that they enjoy life more .
This merely implies that young people have a different set of preferences , and different ideas as to what constitutes as fun .
Consequently , they enjoy different activities .
Many young boys enjoy playing football with their friends .
Playing football can be quite demanding physically .
Rarely , do we see senior citizens playing football .
Instead , we might see them strolling in a park , or watching their favorite TV show .
These activities are less demanding physically , but old people do not enjoy them less .

As medicine and technology have improved , life expectancy has increased .
Today people live much longer than they used to .
People spend many years in their retirement , and many find these years to be the most enjoying years of their life .
People , who are in their retirement , have the time to do what they please .
They do not have meetings and scheduals to meet , and this allows them to live life at a slower pace .
This also allows them to go on long trips and holidays , and see the places they wished to see during their youth .

Also due to improvements in heathcare , old people are not are immobile as they once were .
This allows many old people to continue to fuction normally , and even play sports like golf .

The statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people '' is false , because of the many points that speak against it .
Old people enjoy life no less than young people .
True they enjoy different things , but this is due to the fact that they have different preferences and needs .

6204,1044838.txt,P5,DEU,high,"Cars are of vital importance for everyone 's life .
Today , we can not imagine a situation without cars .
Even if we do not have one ourselves , other people utilize them to make our lives easier - be it a transporter bringing food to the supermarket or the car that brings us to the hospital in case of a severe accident .

In my opinion , we need cars and the populatoin in our country knows that .
This is the reason why I think that the number of cars will not diminish in the next 20 years .

There are a myriad of arguments for and against the use of cars :
The major argument against cars is certainly the pollution of our environment .
And it is true - cars , as we know them today , need certain natural resources and do pollute our environment to a certain degree .
If this is always true , there will probably be fewer cars in use in 20 years that there are today .
At some point in time , people would recognize the harm of cars and would definitely try to reduce the number of cars to protect the environment .

But this may not be a realistic case : I am of the opinion , that our scientists get smarter and smarter .
Until today , they already invented hybrid engines and engines that are only run by solar energy or plant oils .
Today , those inventions can not replace cars that need gaz to produce power , because scientists are still trying to get more out of the new foundings .
But consider the time the gaz engine needed to be as perfect as we know today : It took long years for the car industry to be able to produce those engines .

Given this evolution , it is possible and very realistic that our scientists will make a huge contribution to the improvement of the ` new ' engines in the next 20 years .
Even if 20 years might be too short to develop a car that does not pollute the environment at all , I think that the scientists are on a good way to find an engine that drastically reduces the pollution .
And after another 20 years , we might already use cars that do not need any natural resources like gaz .
If this is the case , everyone will recognize the outstanding advantages of cars , so that the number of cars will rather increase .

8802,1390206.txt,P8,TEL,medium,"I would certainly agree with the statement that states `` successful people try new things and takes risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' because people are successful only if they could do something which other people does not think or try of doing them .

Successful people are those who dare to try new challanges and takes risk to to achieve desired results .
One example of this can be explained from my college days , my college has a three day festival called `` euphoria '' on the third day an actor agreed to come and perform in our college event for some amount of money .
But on day before his performance he called the management and said he want more money to perform as our rival college was willing to pay him large sum of money so our college management told us that they could not afford that much money to bring that actor to perform .
As we have printed the invitation cards and even distributed them , so we took the risk of using our college lemonaide machine which was not in good shape , we took great pain by staying in campus at night and repaired that machine and from next day itself we started to sell lemonaide to people visiting our college to see the function as it was in the summer season the total lemonaide was sold and we got required money to make the actor perform in our college .
By making the actor to perform in our college without financial help of our college management every one in our campus started to respect us and labeled us as successful candidates who saved our college reputation .

Thus , successful people are those who not only try new things and takes risks but makes there every move in order to help and improve the place or conditions people live in .

To measure enjoyment , one really must look deeper into the lives of people and determine what actually enjoyment to people .

I do not believe in the statement , ` Young people enjoy life more than older people ' , as different people have different ways of enjoying life .
Just because one is old and does not have the strength and energy levels as those of young people does not mean that enjoyment in their life is over .
My grandfather was a very happy man untill I knew him .
He had lived life to its fullest and always wore a smile .
He always enjoyed sitting reading a book on that old antique arm chair of his .
I do not believe that is much of a way to enjoy oneself but it was for him .
He may be deprived of hearing but that did not stop him from watching the television .
He simply looked at the moving pictures , drew his own conclusions and had a good time .
He took enormous pride in smoking the best cigars and tobacco pipes available in his era and enjoyed the fact that he could afford to do so .
What is there in it to be so happy about ?
But that made him happy and he appreciated it .

Young people may well be able to do a lot of sporting activities such as rafting , trecking among other thrilling tasks .
They may be able to attend disco-techs all night and play sports they enjoy at higher levels but that does not mean all the happiness and enjoyment in the world .
Old folks may listen to old classics and enjoy themselves more than being at a disco even in their prime age .

They may enjoy the extra relaxation time they get after retirement and do a lot of things they had in mind that could not have been done while they were young .
They may be able to enjoy their family life more than ever before , especially playing with their grandchildren and seeing them grow up .
One does not get to do all this in his younger age .
Imagine all the excitement and memories they are missing out on .
This does not mean that all of a sudden older people enjoy themselves more .

Old people may look bored and weary but they according to me are enjoying life the most .
My grandfather actually told me of all his childhood experiences and was so happy in doing so .
Even the little things mean so much to them and its these litlle things , that we fail to notice , that bring unimaginable joy to them !

One the one hand those who believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than nowadays , say that the goverments of the differents countries must set restrictions in the use of cars to stop contamination problems caused by the combustion gases , such as acid rain or the growing of the hole in the ozone layer .
Also many people want to prevent cars coming into the city centre in order to make the cities more confortable to their citizens as well as to avoid traffic jams .

On the other hand there are people who strongly feel against the reduction in the number of cars that will be in use in the future .
Their main reason to say this is that the car is quicker than the public transports therefore it allows people to save time in their movings .
Furthermore the high prize of the tickets for the bus or the underground do n't help leaving the car at home .

To sum up the topic of the number of cars in use in the future will remain controversial .
While some people mantain that in twenty years the number of cars in use will be smaller , you can find just as many people who think that this number must even grow .
In my opinion , unless we discover any kind of non-contaminating car , we should restrict the use of vehicles to preserve our planet in good conditions .

Of course , we had a tour guide ..

3508,608718.txt,P2,FRA,medium,"Conventional wisdom has it that young people enjoy life more than older people do because they are healthier and they did n't have to many sad experiences yet .
I think that it is ironic since most of people want to live longer .
But it is also true that everybody wants to look younger .

First of all I think that old disabled persons who live with an amount of pills cannot really enjoy their life .
But older persons like my parents who are between forty and fifty years old can enjoy life more than young people .
It can be put down to the fact that they know they have less time than previously .

Teenagers often consider high school period as the worst period of their entire life .
In fact their body and their mentality change and they often suffer from these changes .
They often contest the authority of their parents or their professors .
This is the expression of an unease .
On the contrary to teenagers , adults have had the time to accept themselves and this is crucial to enjoy life .

Children do n't want to become adult because they are reluctant to have too many responsabilities .
They are not aware of the violence and of the other problems that one could encounter , if they are to protected by their parents .
Parents think that their children are happier thanks their protection but on the contrary , children will be more disappointed when they will discover how harsh the life can be .

When one looks in the past , one often thinks '' I was so dumb '' .
I do n't regret this period of my life because I was ignorant and I do n't want to balk now .
I want to go on and make new experiences .

Life is a surprise at almost any age and this is why one can always enjoy life .

7056,1119490.txt,P8,SPA,medium,"I believe that successful people are successful because thay have taken risk in their lifes , however some people could argue that a successful life stands on what you think is being success for you .

It probably depens on the way you have been educated .
Some people find their success in doing what they are doing good .
Others are always trying to go a step forward .
The unexplored part of going a step forward has a strong risk that people has to take only if they want to .
And this is what I believe make us being different or at least , not being as everyone elses .
Successful is related with being strange , in a unique way , to stand out of the rest of the people .

However , I think it is totally related to you own culture .
Being successful in the United States is not the same of being successful in China or a small town in Africa .
My personal experience travelling aroung the world has given me a different idea of what is means to be successful in life .

Usually , I relate the success with my own culture and place it in what we call the first world , which means being successful in bussiness enviroment or economy talking .
However I think it is neccessary to take a step back and think of other cultures : being successful could mean be the leader of a small town in India were it is related to the one how was able to do something ( for example bring water to a village from a long_distance river or to be able to kill a lyon in the middle of a forest ) .
In all those cases people needed to take risks , but risks that had a meaning on their culture and circumstances .
In this sense only people how is brave enough to take the risk have the chance of being different can be successful .

I definitely agree with the statement , and actually I believe that people is successful becasue those risk they have taken , have given them their success .

7077,1121351.txt,P5,TEL,high,"`` I know not how the third world war is going to be , but I know that fourth world war is going to be with stones and sticks '' , this is a famous quote by Sir Albert Einstein .
TODAY is world of rapid technological and industrial advancement , the day is not far when there is a saturation of sources eventually leading to retrogradation of the society .
I would absolutely agree that in the next twenty years ther would be fewer cars than they were today .

I remember reading the poems of William Wordsworth , beautifully describing the countryside and mother nature .
In today 's world it is indeed impossible to find such a place in real .
Right from the inception man is driven by a quest for knowledge .
There is an urge or a curiosity to know and to find out things around him .
This has definitely led to the industrial revolution .
One of the biggest achievements has been the invention of the automobiles .
With the development of cars and other means of trasnport the world had definitely become a smaller place .
conveyeance was made easier and effective .
But one important aspect to this revolution is the traffic congestion it has created .
I would like to state an example , I live in a big city and it takes me one hour to reach my college which is just 8 kilometers away from my house .
I will have plan out things before hand incase i wish to go to a place somewhere far as it literally takes me years to reach my destination .

There has been a significant rise in the awareness about the pollution caused by automobiles .
This pollution not only effects the environment but also to living beings .
The number of cases of asthma and other lung diseases have risen due to the ever increasing traffic and pollution liberated by vehicles .
There are cases of early retardation of child development due to the inhalation of harmful lead components released by the vehicles .

In earlier days , cars were a status issue .
People who were wealthy only could afford a car .
It is no longer so .
Although people are able to buy cars but the maintainance of cars is a difficult task in todays 's wrold .
It is said that buying a car is easier than maintaining it .

Today there is an increasing urge to GO GREEN by reducing the individual contribution to go green .
People are reverting to the use of cycles and bikes which use plants as fuel .
People are becoming more health consious and hence perfer to walk or jog it up to their destinations .

Hence I would like to conclude that although there is a continuous rise in the number of cars , after a span of twenty years the number of cars will reduce due to increasing awareness among people .

I think so because of my personal expierences .
I lived a short time in africa - and so I think I have a better `` view of the world '' what covinced me .

In Africa it was normal that everybody help eachother and this was the own way to get something .
Maybe there is a specially situation .
There are not enough education and think 's like that .
In the other way the cities looks like in europe and you can by everthing like in europe .
The people have n't enough and so you need the help from the others .
In Europe or in the other industrial states the name of this thing is like `` develop countries '' .
But is it right ?
I do n't think so .

I can understand the author of the statement if we have only a look of the industrial states .
I think in these countiers the people are conzentrated at ther own .
Everybody want 's the best for ownself and so it can be happen that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
But is that a good way ?

In my view it 's better to help eachother because in this way you can also learn from eachother .
Furthermore I believe that helping is a good think and if you help anybody you get back more ...
Maybay not in the same second but in own time ...
And if we have n't any time in our high `` develop world '' so we must took the time because it is nessesary .
If you help somebaody you can also open your mind for an other point of view or you can learn an other waw to past the goal .
S , I believe in this way we can learn form the `` develop world '' .
It 's not good to forget in what a safty world we live .
These safty world can also changes in a world where anybody looking at there own and forget the other ...
In my opinion that will be not good .
So , perhaps have the `` industrial world '' in one time a look to the `` third world '' to learn someting - the importend thing not forget to help .

Concluding I would like to say , that I can understand the people in the high develop countries to think that the young people nowadays do not have enough time to helping their commmunities .
But the high develop countiers are not the world .
It is nessesary that the people not forget , that the succsess is not the importend thing .
If you help eachother so is a smile for a thank sometimes more ...
Maybe in the industrial countiers will change the view .

5386,940814.txt,P6,TUR,high,"I do n't agree with the idea that the best way of traveling is to join a group led by a tour guide for several reasons .
First of all , no matter how many people are contributing to the group , hiring a tour guide is always a lot more pricy than traveling by yourself or with a friend or two .
Indeed , I find these tours as tourist traps because the tourists pay double or triple price when they visit museums with the ` knowlegable ' tour guides , compared to the amount they pay at the door .
For example , I went to Moscow last year and at the Kremlin Palace I noticed that the visitors are given two options , either you can hire a guide at the door for an outrageous price or you buy an audio guide for only three dolars .
Is n't it obvious which one makes more sense ?

Some people might argue that a tour guide has a lot of information about the city that is being visited , so it is essential to be led by one .
However a well-writen guide book would compensate the need for a tour guide and these guide books could easily be obtained from the bookstores or even tourist information offices .
Recently these guide books are being written by locals of the place and they contain all the valuable information that a visitor may need .
Furthermore they are being updated as new places open or anything changes in the place .

Also traveling with a group has the inevitable disadvantage of moving as a group .
Despite of the fact that each individual has there own interests and their own preferences , the group has a certain schedule for the entire trip and mostly it is required to follow this schedule .
This requirement leds people to see places that they have no interest in and in a way it turns the trip into an unpleasent event .

4370,757784.txt,P3,TEL,high,"The statement that the young people do not give much time for helping their communities is a genaralised statement which has to be debated upon .
I feel that the young person 's tendency to help mainly depends on the kind of atmosphere he dwells in and the basic nurture that has been provided to him in his younger years .
A person who has seen the difficulties of life in his young age is prone to actually understand the situation of the helpless .
That empathy is the driving force for the youth to help people .
we have seen many personalities all over the globe .
Some of them being Mother Theresa , Hellen keller and Mahathma Gandhi .
If we look deeply , it was their young days that facilated and ignited their minds to sacrifice their life for their community .
This point rightly speaks for the youth .
We saw a lot of protests and active participation from the youth right from the twin tower tragedy to the katrina .
Young people hae always been there for their communities in the point of distress .

The other side of today 's youth pictures students roaming around with guns and the rapid addictionof today 's youth to drugs and other habits .
Empathy can surely not be expected from these youths .
Where there is no empathy there is no place for service .

The young people today cannot be catogarised on a general scale in this aspect .
There are a lot of young people who take up their life 's aim as service at the same time there are a lot of them who act in the opposite direction .
Furthur more , the increased terrorist attacks and the increasing hostility of the surroundinds serve as a catalyst to the youth of today to stand up for their communities .
so i think that a sensible part of the youth is rightly giving its part for the community

A perfect example to support my view would be me [ young ] when compared to my father [ old ] .

I have no responsibilities to take care of .
So I have more time to fish out , hang out with friends and participate in social activities .
On the other hand , my father has lot of responsibilities .
He has his time devoted to certain activities .
He is so occupied with this that he does not get any time to enjoy his life .

I also believe that attitude is another factor which can support my view .
Young people have possitive or open kind of attitude .
While the old people have reserved kind of attitude .
Yound people think that here is lot to enjoy in life .
Old people just think opposite to this .

Another reason to support my view would be spending factor .
I normally spend more than my father .
My father prefers to save instead .
By spending I am able to try our new things , party , going places etc and enjoy life .

Technology advancement is also one of the reason .

7832,1204080.txt,P6,JPN,medium,"I do not think travelling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel .
There are some reasons I do not prefer .
First , tour will limit us where to go .
Although it will be much cheaper than going alone the tour might not be as what you have thought .
You might want to see around other places but since it is moving with group , you will not able to go by only your feelings .

Secondly , the tour guide will decide the time they are looking , so you are not able to see it as long as you want .
Different from travelling by yourself , a tour wants to go many place as possible to have more customers .
So they are not able to take enough time to see each place because they have to go next on time .
This might be OK for some people , but others might think they are not satisfied .

Thirdly , there will be many other people that you do not know each other .
This will make you feel tired and no privercy .
It will make you feel tired by It is not only by yourself , so you have to make rules to have the trip smooth .
But for any reason you are going to the trip , I think they want to get away from every day life .
So this will not let you feel freely if you have to make rules .

From these reasons , I prefer travelling by ourselves might be the best way to travel .
Traveling by ourselves might cost higher , but you are able to plan the trip freely as you think and do what ever you want to make it satisfied .
I am sure this kind of trip will be greater than going in a group led by a tour guide .

2934,508583.txt,P6,DEU,high,"According to the task to discuss wether travelling in a group led by a tour guide might be the best way to travel I would like to say that first of all it is one of the most comon ways of travelling .
Especially Japanese are often seen travalling in a huge group .

Me myself I like to travel alone and disagree because of that with that statement .
When travel alone you are independent and you can make your plan by yourself .
In big groups you have to do what everybody wants to do or if there is a tour guide what he planned .
Most of the time there are no exceptions .
Being alone also means that you get to no other people maybe native people , maybe other visitors .

But on the other hand I like a mix of both like taking a tour guide for a day or travelling with others who are interested in seeing the same things or places .

I already traveled alone by myself and it was the best experience I have ever made .
Although I made trips with friends , groups or my family before I had never so much fun .
If you come to a town were you do not know even one person I will have to talk to stragers .
And besides I am shy I got to know many people which I would have never met if had been travelling in a group .
I made trips with them , what explains that I do not disagree striktly with this statement .

What I am sure about is that you learn much more about the country you go to , as if you had gone with a guided group , if you prepare yourself a little .

Most of the times you can barely find a tour guide which is right qualified to tell you more fact , than if you had informed yourself by books .
Some might say that this is not true , but I just talk according to the experience I made .

`` But is not more safe if you travel in a group ? '' some might ask .
I have the opinion that if you do not take to much risk and if you care a little for yourself , you will travel at least with the same safety .

On the other hand groups of tourist are easier aims of terrorist attacks because the follow a strict plan and are easy to hit .
But in general I just like to travel no matter how !

7981,1232625.txt,P7,ZHO,medium,"Yes , i agree with this statement .
I think when students understand the ideas , of course they will learn the facts .
Firstly , students should n't concentrate on the facts , when they just starting to learn it .
I am a student , i know it is more important for me to understand how does the teacher think about the question and the way she thinks , what are the important points , and how can i catch it .
Therefore , i can translate it into my own way , and then i can find the facts .

Secondly , student suppose to know that we studying not only for the test or the deploma , we want to make us more knowledgable , so they should consentrate on the ideas but not the facts .
Athought the facts is also important , it is more important to understand the ideas .

Thirdly , as my opinion , i really prove that understand ideas is more important .
When i in the primary school in China , i learned all the basic algebra .
But at that time , i am too young to understand the ideas , so i just remebered the facts .
After i graduated , i went to amiddle school , i found that i completely confused about all i learned in primairy school .
So after that , i know to understand ideas and concepts than it is for me to learn facts .

I remebered that a famous author said : first , you should learn the facts , but after that it is more important for you to uderstand the ideas , the way that people using to think .

On the other hand , if you just learn the facts , you just copy the answer into your mind .
It is same like you eat the food which other people have already eaten .
Nobody wants to be a memory machine , students should be the people who invented the ideas .

In a word , understanding ideas and concepts are more important than just learn the facts .
In that way , you are a wise person .

On the one hand i think many of young people are egoistic today , on the other I know that it is not easy to manage social ambitions today , espacially for the youth .
I can imagine the young pepole because Iam one of them .

I do not help in my community or neither I work in a social programm .
The reasons for that are my few time between the duty 's wich filling my whole day .
I think the possibilty to help without any pay in communities is better at a younger age of children , from eleven till fifteen .
Many older young people are busy with their education and own future and too young children maybe are not in the confidence or have the responsibility to work for the community .

Many of the work wich is to do in a german communities is made by so called young people who finished school .
If thez do n't want to go to the army , they can choose a social work in communities , hospitals , etc . .
The truth is that young people do n't help for free .
They are always looking for a payment and do n't do anz help benfitly .
Iam sure that there are many things wich young people could do in a community

2235,386237.txt,P3,ITA,medium,"In these years there are less partecipation from the young people to help their communities .
I am one of the young people nowadays and I agree that young people take care a very short time to helping their communities , but I understand also the reasons because they do it .

The first reason is that with this new global world with a lot of videogames , football or music programs , bring the young people to spent a very long time to play videogames , or to play some sport , instead of to help their communities .

A second reason is that the information about communities in all town is very small and much of young people do n't know what is it a communitie .
Therefore , young people do n't give time to helping communities because they do n't know the existence of these communities .

A last reason is that in these years life is very fast and if young people study sever hours every day for the school and in free time they play a sport to relax them , they have no time to help their communities .

From these reasons is clear my opinion .
I agree that young people spent no time to help their communities and spent a lot of time in different and useles things .
But I am also a young people and I understand their behaviour , because they live in a very fast world with many television and videogames and if they study much of their free time , like me , they ca n't give enough time to helping their communities .
However , if they have a lot of free time they should to help their communities because is a very good way to spent their time .

I disagree to this statement .

One of the several point to put across to justifiy my disagreement is `` survival of the fittest '' .
Today 's world is so fast and full of compatition that to survive young people have to be a in this race due to which they left with no time for themself , for there family , and his own enjoyment .

Secondly , at this stage of life in young people , there are a lot reposibility for example if a person is just graduated from the school he has a to take care of his further career , like what job to take or which city to choose .
Furthermore , if the person of lets say mid 30th , he has this own type of commitment such paying rent , daliy expense , buying a house , saving for retairement , settlement of children , Where as the old people has got over with all these responsibility They have save money of themself there children are settled .
They can have there own time .

Thirdly , Working person can not make long luxuray vaction program very offen has he has to manage his office , money , family as well as his time .
Money , has a great importance these days .
Everythings is so expensive that even a person want to buy something for his entainment he has to think twice .
Not all people can afford to do such expense .

For young people this is the time to work and to make the future secure so that they can live a easy and wealthy life in there old days .
Working hard in the young age is also possible as our body also allow as to do so where as in the old age spending long office hours , and doing vigrous work would not be possible .

So at the end I would like to conclude the essay by mentioning that , being young is that point of time where you can work hard live hard , and save for future by all mean .
All the missing enyoying can be achived later during the old age when there will a lot of time to spend .

541,98336.txt,P2,ITA,medium,"I partially agree with this statement for many reasons .
Young people have less responsability , they just have to study or work , or both , but after this they usually have spare time to spend with friends , having fun .
This is a nice aspect of being young .
Young people have their things to think to , but rarely they 're responsable for someone else 's life .
Older people have more to think to .

They usually have a family which brings a lot of joy , but also a lot of stress ; financial stress for example , parent 's have to think how to earn many to go on , to make their children study and have fun .
Young people do n't have this type of problems and this makes their life more enjoyable , in a certain way .

Young people want to feel strong emotions and live new experiences .
Everything has to be intense : loud music , disco , staying out late at night .
Older people already lived these emotions , they know how it feels to be young , but they do n't need these feelings anymore .
They belong to the past .
I think that when one gets older , he finds joy and happyness in smaller things .
For example just by spending an afternoon with his family or old friends .
There 's no need to stay up until the break of dawn , but just to live life and appreciate its simple things .

This does n't means that older people cannot have fun , it 's just a different way of having fun .
A young man 's challenges are ( in my case ) : university exams , human relations , family life and a job to pay CD 's and amusements .
Growing up one needs more , or ( I think ) should need more than just having fun dancing at the disco .
After the studies one needs to find a job , someone to love and to start a new life on its own .
A marriage is a great accomplishment .
The partner and the sons become the most precious thing one could have .
This is happyness .
I do n't believe young people enjoy life more than older people .
The way of having fun changes with time , but life is always enjoyable .

4733,825234.txt,P1,TEL,medium,"I agree with the statement , It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
Broad knoledge on many accademic subjects play an imortant role in the future as ample exposure to all the profficional subject , get an analytical sills , know all the things about the society .
In my view broad nowledge get only taking many accademic subjects offered by the university .

Knowledge is gain only by learning more things in the world .
Todays world is globaliged one thats why we learn more things .
we grip on many subject we get ample exopsure greatly and easily .

Secondly , analyticall sills are use full for every person in the society they get by learning different subjects .
They give broad variety of knowledge to communicate easily with the others .

All accademic subbjects are related to the our proffictional programming .
Those are use full in the future .
Those subjects give thining ability to your mind .
Besides specialization subjects they give stenth to your mind .

Some times i thin that many of the academic subjects for upto undergraduate level are more usefull to get wide varitey of knowledge , after complition of undergradute , concentrate on the specialized subject that is related to our proffectional academics that time its gives an more information about specialize subgect and accuire good knowledge easily and quickly .

I agree with this statement because history has showed us that the success , in any field of the human behavior , reach those who dare to go against `` regular costumes '' .
For example , everybody thougt that Christopher Columbus was insane when he expressed his idea of an espherical planet .
`` The earth is plane '' , this was the general thougth and evrybody laughted at him when Columbus decided to proved them wrong .
We already know what happened after he got the support of Queen of Spain .
Probably , he died not knowing that his madnees wolud lead and prove a revolutionary theory about our planet .

JesusChrist , the most amazin man ever lived , is the real proof that revolutionary thougts would lead the society to evaluate its behevior and change their costumes .
After 2.000 years , his learnings has effected every society in the world .

Albert Einstein , known physician and called `` Father of modern physics '' .
With his Relativity Theory , Einstein explained the behavior and the reason for every phenomenom that ocurrs in the nature , he took part in major researches around the world , and his theories are subject of investigation now in these days .
He was a lonely man , and probably was consider as `` abnormal to the society '' , but time has proved us how his madnees change the world .

Taking a look at these three examples we can see that persons who dare to make and to express ideas that lead to new things change our manners , costumes and even our way of thinking .

Many succeful people follow these lessons and teachings , and the consecuences are that their way of livining and ideas take places in our minds and thougths and we hope that we can introduce them in our life

9943,1611162.txt,P4,DEU,high,"I deeply agree to the statement that advertisements make products seem better than they actually are .
In fact , I believe that many products would hardly be bought at all if people only knew the product itself and not the advertisement that goes along with it .
My opinion on this has been influenced by experience and by academic studies , and I would like to state several reasons for my answer .

First of all , the psychological mechanisms behind advertisments are rather obvious .
It is easy to see that a galopping horse and a handsome man have not much in common with the taste of a cigarette , but the positive feelings created by the descibed image do influence a persons feelings towards the advertised brand .
This can be explained psychologically and physiologically , and I am sure that studying Psychology has helped me understand the underlying principles better .
The advertisement industry is a huge and powerful one and the quality of an adverts thoroughly influences the selling numbers of a product .

In one lecture on the psychology of advertisements I heard about certain techniques that are employed by advertisers which have only deepened my opinion on advertisements .
An example of the fakeness of the presented product is the fact that the thickly streaming milk one can see in an advertisement for cornflakes is as tasteless as the flakes themselves : the milk is actually glue and the flakes are made of plastic .

I am convinced that most advertising companies employ similar techniques to make the products seem supernatural and generally better than they are .
It is unlikely that a company could still compete with others if they simply stated that their product was good .
It seems like a good idea to have certain regulations in advertising .
These do already exist and it seems almost necessary to protect consumers from being lured into purchasing a product that only seems attractive because of the idea sold along with it .

It makes sense that a producer wants his product to shine in the best light .
However , I think that the techniques being used in advertising these days go far beyond what one could call a realistic image of a product .
Therefore , I can only agree to the statement given .

There are arguments for both opinions .
On the one side , you have to think of the less devoloped countries of today .
They will clearly have economic progress and more wealth for the people within the next twenty years .
For example , the quality of life in countries like China or India has been improved within the last decades .
And qualitiy of life means having your own car , as it is common in Europe or Northern America .
So , in the year 2026 , the world could be faced with inhabitans of former `` third world '' countries who drive their own car .

One the other side , the problems of carbon dioxide , such as global warming or more tornados , will leed to a different way to consider the use of energy .
The `` green house effect '' is more and more acknowleged among scientists , and maybe somedays also the governments will consequentially deal with this problem .
Cars are one of the main producers of coarbon dioxide .
So , if you want to try to stop global warming , one possibility could be to reduce the number of cars .
Maybe the governments - instead of making it possible for their citizens to have an own car - will improve the public traffic systems like buses or trains , or they will try to develope new technologies which are n't dependent on fossile energy , like solar energy nowerdays .
In Germany , also the taxes on fuel are very high .
The government tries this way to make the people become aware of their use of fuel and maybe to reduce it .

Finally , no one knows what the technological or economical developement of the world will be like within the next twenty years .
But these developements will extremely influence the number of cars .

I think , the second version is more probable and therefore I agree with the statement above .
The idea of millions of Chineses and Indians driving their own cars and producing much more carbon dioxide than today is n't very convenient .

929,154270.txt,P1,JPN,medium,"To have broad knowlege is important , but to specialize in one specific subject is more important for researchers and engineers to research and develop new things .
Therefore I disagree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .

One of the most obvious example is in research laboratory .
It is impossible for one person to have broad and deep knowledge , so we must cooprate each other .

To research a big project , for example to make space ciatol to make nuclear fusion power plant and so on , it is necessary to gather the professional researchers and engineers which have deep knowledge and experience about it .
Combining them , new things are developed and researched .

When researchers discuss about some new penomenon , If they did not have knowledge and experience which specialized in one specific subject each other , they could get

In conclusion , deep knowledge and experience are more important for us .
They are useful for us to become specialists .

6165,1040327.txt,P8,FRA,high,"Many people are trying to find the way that leads to a successful life .
The proposed theory means that to be successful you have to dare doing new things instead of focusing on what you already know to do well .
I do not agree with such a thesis .

First , many people are successful only by doing what they know how to do well .
If you do things better than others do , you have great chances to succeed in your project .
For instance , a lot of sport champions only focus on their sport and do not lose time besides .
For example , Roger Federer , the current best tennis player in the world , was learnt tennis since he was very young and went on in this way which lead him to success .
Whereas a lot of well known singers who tried to play in films did not manage in this way and went back to what they did well .

Neverlethess , many amazing success story happened to people who tried to do something new .
For instance , the famous former tennis player Yannick Noah , after a good carrier as a tennis player , has become a very famous singer .

Consequently , if I do not really agree with the thesis I have to acknowledge that it is possible to be successful in other field that the one you are meant to .
So , my point is that even if you are doing well in something , this does not mean that you can do well eslewhere .
On the contrry , I think that people who have been successful in the field they were prepared for have better chances to have great achivements in others fields because they have been learnt how to commit in a project , to be professional and to believe in themselves .

12013,1980911.txt,P4,KOR,high,"How many times do you see advertisements a day ?
Recently we live in the flood of advertisements and it is true that sometimes they can be very useful information to buy something new .
However , it is not good to trust every fact which is in the advertisement .
Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

Showing their product seem better than they really are can be considered as a marketing strategy .
There are too many products which have the same function in the world , and if they want to sell their products , they need to make the advertisement of their product which has the same function but has to seem much better than other products .
The problem is from that point .
They decide to lie in order to sell their product more and the customers who buy that product wil be cheated .

I had an experience to buy a set of equipments for cooking .
In the television advertisement , it looked like magic .
Show-hosts could to everything with those eqipments easily and it worked very well on tv .
And also the product was much cheapper than other products which were selled in real shops .
However , I could not do anything well with the same equipments .
The knives which had special purposes were worse than a knife which I had used before them , and I could use several types of pots and pans only for two or three months .
And then , I had to buy new equipments .

Even though it is true that advertisements are necessary to show someone 's products widely and easily , there should be only truth in the advertisements .

10697,1745468.txt,P5,TUR,high,"The demand for cars is rapidly increasing .
But in twenty year time , I think there will be fewer cars in use than today .
I agree with the idea that the car number will increase in twenty years , and hasve some reasons for agreing .

First , the fossil oil based energy sources are dicreasing .
It is getting expensive and unefficent to use those resources for the energy supply of transportation .
Electricity , nuclear energy sources , solar energy and even hydrogen is in consideration for replacing the fossil oil usage .
There is also another reason for this replacement which is the air polution that is caused by the fossil oil usage .
In order to reduce the polution governments are limiting the gasoline types and quality used in cars .
That also rises the price .

Not only the fossil oil reserves but also the iron , steel and other metal reserves are forcing us to use our resources more carefuly and more logical for our future .
We should understand that these natural resources are limited .

Considering the population growth , and the sizes the big city 's reach , it is possible to understand the need of a special way of transportation : public transport .
The trafic jams , the time consume rides are causing caos , trafic accidents , polution in the citys .
Because of these results of personal transportation solutions , annual expenditure of the economies are increasing constantly .
This is not a weight every economy could handle .

I think the public transportain , especially the rail usage has to increase to handle these problems .
Fossil oil energy sources could be used more efficiently and harmless in different areas of the industry .
More enviorement friendly and economic solutions has to be found and used for transportatin problems .

The car companies are working on the alternative energy usage for the future to substain their companies .
Some big companies buy the other companies to reduce the competition and some others have merged .
This could be analyze to understand the sector 's future characteristics .
I think the shrinking market conditions force car companies to fight harder to survive .

With all these signs , I think in twenty years there will be less cars in use than today .

122,22249.txt,P5,JPN,low,"There is growing awarness of car problems all around the world .
Cars have brought us much convenience to transport while they have caused various social or ecological problems such as traffic jams , noise , traffic accidents , air pollution , too much consumption of petroleum and so on .
Now we have to solve these problems in order to survive on the earth .
I think it essential for us to reduce the number of cars .

First of all , we have to spend much money to maintain our own automobiles .
In our modern society , we have so much developed public traffic that we need not to transport with our cars .
Although we would be involved terrible trafic jams , public traffic such as trains and subways are usually be punctual .
Moeover , in general , the fee of public traffic is inexpensive .
Therefore , we can save not only time but also money by using public traffic .
The price of gasoline has gotten higher and higher recently , and the tendency is to be continued .

Second , there are no longer much place to park cars , especially in many cities .
The world population has been getting more and more during this decade .
Now we have no longer much enough land to dwell on .
Therefore , it will cost us too much to park our own cars in the city .
Many people have to shed their own cars in order to save their money and to save the area to live in .

In conclusion , for these reasons , spending much money and insuficient space to park cars , I agree the statement `` there will be fewer cars than there are today in twenty years . ''

4361,756686.txt,P5,ITA,medium,"Every year the cost of cars and petrol increases , every year oil at disposition and space for cars are reduced , traffic jams and environmental pollution are a serious problem .
These facts indicate that in a near future the world will run out of oil or it will be very expensive and unaffordable to buy oil and cars , roads are always more and more crowded and make it difficult to travel , the pollution is getting worse and worse .
This is why in my opinion in twenty years from now there will be less cars in use that there are today .

If the world is not willing to change today 's mentality and care more for our environment and our health , we will soon live the consequences .
For example polluted air will cause health problems , witch by the way it is already happening , or we wo n't have anymore fossile energy at disposition for more important use than transport .

Today our society is not aware of the consequeces our pollution is causing on the environment and for example the ozone .
When it is understood that what we are doing is wrong then the restrinctions will start , for instance forbidding cars on sundays or making it more expensive to drive because of the eccessive taxes on gas .

3097,536899.txt,P3,HIN,high,"I strongly believe that the youth of today is committed to help their communities .
Even in today 's competitive world , we see numerous examples where the young people take out substantial time from their busy schedule for their communities ' help .

First , let us address the concept of community ?
The term ` community ' can be defined as a group of people , organisations or cultures that are motivated by a common manifesto .
Let us take 3 different examples to support the claim made above .

The concept of ` National Social Service ' or NSS is quite old in India .
It is a community of college going student volunteers that reaches to the under-privileged sections of their respective communities to ensure their upliftment .
In a recently concluded survey on its efficacy , it was heartening to note that 68 % of those asked were already a part of this service and had made on an average 15 visits in the last 4 months to various places .
And another 86 % were willing to help raise old clothes and stuff that would be useful for the poor .

Another example is that of the religious sects .
The youth today has ensured that they celebrate their religious functions with their utmost fervor .
This ensures that the religious principles are upheld which are so necessary for the spiritual well-being of a community .
In the recently concluded ` Navratri ' , one of the biggest Hindu celebrations in India , the youth was at its energetic best .
Across places , beautiful and decorative sculptures of gods were made for the people to worship .
Different groups of young people helped raise funds for the functions in their respective areas .

After the recent ` Mumbai blasts ' on 11th July , there has been a new committment on part of the youth .
Efforts to increase awareness amongst their communities are going on .
Mumbai saw a huge rally of around 20,000 college students to appeal for communal harmony on the next day of the blasts .
This was followed by a huge movement throughout India where the students formed groups and volunteered to distribute pamphlets about the ways to improve the awareness and internal security .
Numerous students came forward during incidents like Gujarat earthquake , Kargil War , Bihar floods , etc. and even in the rehabilitation process which took very long .

Thus the 3 examples above depict how the young people nowadays help in the economic , spiritual and social well-being of their communities .

7089,1122354.txt,P2,JPN,medium,"I disagree with the statement because I think that the old people can also enjoys their life by doing what they want .
It is true that there will a fewer choises to do than the youger people , but they can still enjoys it in other way .
For example , let 's say that there is a old man who loved to do basket ball games when he was young .
He might not able to play it anymore , because he does not have enough strength .
But he can rather watch the game which his grand son plays with his friends .

Also , it might be a good time to do what they wanted to do , but not able to do , in their young age .
Some people still does work even they gets old , but usually they retired the work and have entire days that can spend freely .
I think most of people have some hobby or favorite thing to do , and this is the perfect time to spend all the time , just for doing what the one 's really wants to do .
For example , there might be a old couple that really love to travel to other countries .
They woulnd not able to get time so often to do so , when they are l young .
But they can get a lot of time doing it if they got old .
They might even able to travel aroud the world i they wish to .

So , by 2 reasons , I disagree with the statement that `` Young people enjoys life more thatn older people do . ''

6244,1047824.txt,P5,JPN,low,"If I was asked `` there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years '' , I would answer I do n't think so .
There are two reasons in my opinions .

First , some people use cars , while others use trains and buses , but both transportations are very busy in the morning .
So Seeing from nowadays situations , to dicrease using cars will lead to a serious problem .
For example , we ca n't get on the train which we want to get on because of busy and full , we are late to be the going place because of train 's late running .
Therefore I do n't think there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years since if there are fewer cars in use , public transportation ca n't work .

Second , since many people love to drive a car including me , I 'm sure that cars in use will not dicrease .
Moreover such as people do n't like useing busy trains .
They prefer driving a car to using another transportations .

Lastly , cars companies sill develop car 's model , cost and now they tried to make new kinds of cars like economy car .
So I beilieve cars in use are increasing .

6096,1034481.txt,P7,KOR,high,"Many people in my country believe that learning facts for the students are more important than understanding ideas and concepts because when they students learn a lot of facts , it seems that they look intelligent and in general they get good grades on their test in school .
However , I do not agree with this idea becaue when it comes to learnig , understanding ideas and concepts allows us to use them outside classrooms in a real society .
Besides , they enable us to explain and develop the reason and the way of the facts .

First of all , when we understand ideas and concepts , we can use these ideas when we leave our schools .
In other words , we can adapt them when we work and when we do some research .
For example , if in Englsih classroom you just memorize some grammar to take a test , you easily forget what you learned and memorized after taking the test .
In the contrary , if you understand why and how this grammar is right or not , you will not forget this theory even after taking the test .
Moreover , when you speak and write English , you can utilize the theory you have learned .
Therefore , understanding is more usfule for the more study and the other area .

Secondly , understanding ideas and conceps allow us to explain and develop an other concept in the future .
In other words , it devotes the development of subjects through doing the researches based on the concepts and theories that people have learned .
For instance , when a graduate student wants to do some researches in math , the student has to understand the concepts and ideas of math .
And then , he start to do some researches to develop the concepts or ideas that he want to prove .
Moreover , he can discover a new theory which is useful in the world .
This is thanks to the accumulation of understanding ideas and concepts on his math area .

In conclusion , undersatnding ideas nad concepts in some areas is much more important than leraning facts becasue it is helpful to use and develop it outside classroom since it helps people to be creative .

3858,669455.txt,P8,ITA,medium,"I always try new things in my life and I risk , because I do n't know if I will do these things very well .
In fact I have n't always success in the new things that I try to do .
But I agree with the statement that says that successful people try new things and risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well and I have some reason to sustain this statement .

First of all , I think that if you do n't try or do n't risk , you 'll never know if you will be good to do a thing or if you will be happy to tryied this thing .
For example , last month a friend asked me `` Why do n't you try to sing in my music band ? ''
.
I though that maybe I had not the ability and the experience of sing and become as a leader in a music band , but he said me `` In my opinion , you must try or you 'll never know ! ''
.
So I trusted him and I decided to try .
Now I 'm very glad of this decision because I love sing and also if maybe I 'm not a very good singer I enjoy myself !
This is absolutely important .

Another example I can bring is about my sister .
She 's very insicure and she has n't much self-confidence .
She likes reading poems , but she did n't want to try to write one !
So my mother said her that she would be a good poet if only she wanted to try .
Now the poems of my sister are the best I ever heard .

In conclusion I think that try to do a new thing is never a bad idea .
In fact if also you will not have success you maybe will be happy !

1775,305957.txt,P7,FRA,high,"Usually students do n't really understand why ideas and concepts are tought in schools or universities rather than facts .
Which of these two notions is more important ?
Let 's weigh the pros and cons in order to have a clear opinion on this subject .

I usually ask myself `` what am I doing here ? '' while attending a math course .
Indeed like me most of the students I do n't really understand the point of learning math which is totally absract .
It is always about numbers added to each others , multiplied , equations , solutions !
I 'm not very keen on this subject but in this case I see no solution .
For instance , we all know that becoming a brilliant architect or a great physician is impossible without acquiring math notions and knowledge , but how can this knowledge be useful when we do n't really understand how it can be applied on our everyday 's life ?

In biology for example we learn how the human body is constructed , its anatomy , its strengths and weaknesses .
These scientifical facts are useful at any time !
By learning biology we are able to understand the reasons of the consequences : how our brains command each and every move of our body ...

This example also applies to physics as this subject is tought by showing experimental works and displaying to the students the reasons of all the phenomenons that happen on our planet for instance .
Newton 's falling apple lead him to discover gravity that lead to the explanation of other events .
But in the end it is always about math !
These eplanations can only be proved by this important science and that 's the main reason why this subject must be tought , although its useless apperance which veiles one of the most important aspects of sciences .

To put this in a nutshell , it appears that facts would n't exist whitout ideas and concepts as the proof of a general fact is impossible whitout demonstrating hypothesis by experiments and calculus .
Even if facts are closer to reality than concepts , these two topics ca n't be taken apart , they depend on each other .

so i am totally disagree with that young people enjoy their life more then that older people .
its not mandatory for old people to live their life as young people do .
they can live their life in their own way to make it beautiful .
its totally depend on people to people .

Firstally i want to say that older people can do any thing like young people like if they want to go for a party they can go .
if they want to do dance in party they can do .
i had seen one old person in someones party .
these old age person dance like young ones .
he was so active .

secondly , if young people thought that they are active than old person .
so they are wrong .
old person can do anything like marathon etc. it shows that they can work like young people they can do anything which young people cant

thirdly its impoosible to say that young people are more enjoy because young people always take decision instantly which will be not beneficial to them because by doing that can put themslves in danger but for the case of old people they take their their decision after thinking very deeply .
take the example of our poltician they are totally old and take decision very politely which makes them happy .

so i believe that old peolpe can also enjoy like young people not in the same manner just like young one do but in different manner so its ridiculos to say that young can enjoy the life more than that old people .

It all depends on how much time you have .

If we led by a tour guide , we do n't need to worried about the sercurety , all we have to do is just enjoy the new environment .

4327,752312.txt,P1,DEU,high,"Before giving a straight answer to this question , I need to state that it depends on what the specific person intends to use his academic education for .

In my opinion a solid basic knowledge of a variety of subjects should be obligatory to everyone , who seeks an academic degree .
But as this should be content of the school education and somehow a foundation for the decision , which subject is choosen at university , the goal to be perfect in everything is not a useful and not a realistic one .
To understand the last aspect , one should regard that the knowledge in the world is doubling every four years and speed of this process is even increasing .
An all-around genious , like da Vinci or other great characters in the Renaissance , do n't fit in our time .
This means not that I do n't see the importance to link knowledge or to have a broader horizon to deal with academic problems .

Nevertheless I prefer to get an education that gives me the chance to specialize in my field of studies and go as deep into the topic as possible .
The main reason for this position is the fact that most of the students , including me , will once enter the market for well educated and highly motivated working force .
To get an advantage in this competition is essential .
And it wo n't make me special and important for a potential employer that I know a bit about biology and art-history working as an accountant in car industry .
To have a realistic or even good chance in this field of industry I 'd rather rely on my abilities in business administration and knowledge about this kind of industry .
Therefore it is , in my eyes , important to make an early and specific decision , what you want to achieve in your academic studies and - if possible - where you want to work in the future .

The same is relevant for students , who are occupied with for example law .

6624,1079196.txt,P4,DEU,high,"Personally , I agree with the statement saying that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
However , I do not think that this statement is completely correct .
I have to admit that there are several companies advertising their products in an honest way , stating only facts about the product without any misleading slogans or jingles .

On the other hand , the majority of today \ s industries is clever enough to trick their customers into buying their products .
They do so by either creating highly convincing advertisemetns with slogans or jingles people tend to associate with the product , or they claim characteristics and facts about the products that are simply untrue .
The most effective advertising strategy next to an easy to remember jingle you cannot get out of your head is advertising with the support of celebrities presenting the product .

Even though I do not like the idea of being lied to by a company , I can certainly understand this marketing mentality that is so widely spread today .
In a world of globalization , open borders and free markets , every market of every country is flooded with an increadibly high number of foreign products .
Not only do foreign products mostly seem more attractive to customers , they are often cheap copies of orginals invented and produced in the home country .
Monoplies hardly ever exist anymore and competing not only with other companies in the country but especially with foreign companies certainly is rough .

However , I think companies should only try to manipulate customers to a certain extent .
There should be a clear difference between lying completely and persuading and influecing a little .
Being a customer myself , of course , I rely on the government to control marketing strategies on the one hand but I definitely rely on own experiences I make on the other hand .
If I know about a product that it does not fulfill all the expectations the company made me believe in , I will try my best to convince others not to buy it and I hope others will do so as well .
And even if companies tend at times to overestimate a little and seem to be too euphemistic about their products , we still live in a world where people have gotten used to this kind of advertising behavior by now .
I think , there is only a small percentage of society left that truly believes all the statements made in advertisement .
I therefore have the hope that companies of the future will rely on attractive advertisements instead of on false statements .

11094,1819196.txt,P8,TEL,medium,"I agree with the following statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
Successful people always try for new things because for successful people sucecess is not small thing they feel success like `` thirst '' , so they go on searching for new things and they very eager to take risk and succedd in that what they do .

The people with success donot do what they already know because what is the use in doing the known thing always and keep on doing that is a waste of time the successful people donot waste time as time is precious for them .

Take example of our scientists who are successful in one topic also successful in another topic also , becuse they donot want to stop there research and they are not doing their reseach for name and fame , so they will go on doing their work until their death .

Risk taking is another good task of the successful people because successful people always take risks and the way they handle the risks differs from the normal people and thats why they are successful .

Trying new things and risks handling are the tasks of successful people , because a normal man things the same way he thinks every time because he donot want to take risks he comprimises with what he had , the successful person is the one who thinks in the different way and takes risks and he owns the credit of it .

And with out trying how can we say that they are successful people by trying and greater innovation only leads a person to success .

For example , the global warming contains a big threat and we need to save our world .
How can we solve this problem ?
Most likely by thinking more about science ( theories ) , we probabely will solve the problem .
In fact , we need more scientists to pay attention to this area and we need to encourage new generations to take science courses and think more about theories .

We do not have plenty of foods and resources and we need to improve them more .
Without spending energy on the theories behind the genetically modified foods , it would be imposible to grow healthier and numerous foods .
For example , I used to pay two dollars for a pound of apples containing a lot of diseases , now i pay less for better apples .

Summing up , without spending more time on the theories , we could not improve our life standarts and i appriciate to the all scientists devoided their time on them .

8922,1414706.txt,P3,HIN,medium,"I disagree with the topic that younger generation of nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities .
Rather , personally I have experienced that young generation especially the teenagers have contributed tremendously for the development of the society and also at the time of some tragedies for example tsunamis and flood etc .

Firstly , for example after the tsunami incident many young people came in front on their own to help the society by raising funds and by carrying the victims of tsunami 's to the nearest health centres .
They also helped in collecting food , medicine , blankets and various other comodities that were very vital for the survival of the victims .

Secondly , not only during any kind emergency but there are certain incidents in our day today lifes that youngsters perform willingly .
For example , if our neighbours need any thing from the market or any other kind of help such as repairing bicycle or droping thier kids to the school then they are alway willing to help .

On the other hand , youngsters are sometimes percieved as very fashionable and arrogant and it is believed that they are not at all willing to contribute for any kind of help .
But this is wrong as we can see through our real life experiences that thousands of young people are awarded for their contribution in the society example saving somebodies life .

In the conclusion , I would like to add that the are the future and they know thier r

These are people who tend to skip the trees for the forest .
While specializing in one subject is the tendency of ` left brainers ' thinking attitude who skip the forest for the trees .

Personally , I would prefer not regard these choices as mutually exclusive .
Theoretically speaking , I picture these two states as two ` modes ' that I would rejoice in acquiring them both and switching between them .

I thought about applying this by specializing in one ` interdisciplinary ' subject ( like Bioinformatics for example )
This discipline that deals with applying ifnormation technology to deal with bioglogical data .
which requires braod knoweldge in many academic subjects offered subtle difficulties practically practical .

With the proliferaion of knowledge that we are having nowadys , can not be mastered by a single individual .

I know a carpenter that was making 7 dollars per hour , but today is a millionar , why ?
Somebody gave him an opportunity to work in a big project ' They offerered to him to built the roofs of a series of buildings , even though he never did that kind of job , he did not reject it .
He got trained in that area of construction and the people were so happy when the work was finished that gave him more work .

10987,1799981.txt,P8,ZHO,medium,"This issue of whether successful people would like to try new things and take risk or only to do what they already know how to do well is meaningful but contentious since different people could hold vastly diverse views because of their respective backgrounds .

On the one hand , some might insist that doing what people have learned is more important ; on the other hand , others might claim that learning to try new ideas and thoughts is more crucial .

Although the former advice ahs some values , I vote the latter one .
In the following discussion , I employ three lines of reasoning to support my position .

First of all , the main idea that could be presented to develop my position is that learning to try new things could advance one 's thinking .
Obviously , we easily can find a common case that some experts say that trying to think more new things and ideas greatly helps people to improve their ways of critical thinking .

In this case , it is quite marked that both actual experience and common sense could inform us of the notion that the applicability of this idea would be highly agreeable among people .

Second , another point that I select to stress some concers is that learning to try new things means a positive attitude toward the life 's challenges .
For example , a csae that could use to justify my opinion is that all successful business people always want to try the new ideas to create their own businesses and to solve the major problems that they face .

Thus , this point should be well applied to other conditions , thereby forming a creditable standard for assessment of one 's ability .

Finally , on no account can we ignore the important factor that learning to try new things stands for one 's ability to handle different difficulities before we make an overall summary .

It is universally believed that this prospective might be regarded as nothing but an obscure idea in the current would .
However , a case that could prove the imprtance and the influence of this factor is that there are more and more unpredictable situations that could only be sloved by those who would like to break up the old mode and to try to create the new one .

When the pros and cons of each choice are all well checked and comprehensively evaluated , the most striking conclusion would be well-reasoned and well-founded .
To sum up , given the reasons and examples discussed above which sometimes intertwine to form an organic whole and thus becme more persuasive , we could conclude that only kowing how to learn new things from trying to do them could lead a person to become successful in the current business world .

2568,447734.txt,P5,TUR,medium,"The first thing that comes into the mind is that people are simply unconscious about the topic of pollution and environmental problems .
What they really care is their comfort .
Everybody wants to live in comfort , isnt it ?
But they dont think about how much time their comfort will last .
The answer should not say a long period of time because it is this comfort that will end the life on earth .

Everyday , the population of earth increases with acceleration , So , proportional to the number of peaople we can say that the number of cars will certainly increase .
If we are to think of ay decrease in this number , we should considers about peoples consciousness as individulas and governments regulations .

First of all , the cars release outside , to the air , very hazardous gases which cause to ozon depletion .
The people outside dont really know what the ozon deplation is .
Moreover , the old cars that are not used anymore are themselves are the cause of the pollution becouse , the huge metal waste is also thrown into the earth .
So , at this point , scintists have the real job .
They should make both the individuals and the governments beware of this dangerous issue .

Secondly , there is also a conflict here that increase in the number of cars makes themselves useless !
There is a lot of traffic in big cities already and this will increase day by day .
At the end all the cars will be totally useless .
It will be that time that people will begin to think about using buses and railways .
But , I dont think this will happen in a couple of decades .

Finally , with the advances in technology , there may be flying objects that can supply the transport in the cities so that people will no longer need the cars .
But for this technology to be reached , maybe it will take a whole century .

To sum up , I think in the next two decades there will bw even more increase in the number of cars simply because of the incresase in human population .
It will take much more time for people become conscious about environmental problems .
But in the end nature will adjust itself

11711,1929048.txt,P5,JPN,medium,"I disagree with the statesment that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today for the following reasons .

First of all , huge numbers of people will buy their own car in twenty century .
For example , thirty years ago , each family in Japan can buy only one car .
Because it was too expensive and people in Japan was not rich to buy many cars .
When my parents were child , there was a only car for one family .
Thesedays , people in Japan buy own car , so one family purchase two or tree cars .
I think same things will be happen in Idia or China in twenty years .
More and more economy grow , More and more car will be purchased people .
This example clearly show that huge numbers of people will buy their own car .

Second , technology development will give us more opportunity to ride a car .
Some people would say that we should not ride car because it has negative impact for our environment .
Some sity office in Japan do not allow citizens to ride the car inside the central city .
However , some car makers which has high technology already developed electric car .
The cars developed by the company does not pollute the air .
If erectric car is sold at same place with the car which we ride , many people would buy erectric cars .
And goverment would encourage to buy erectric cars and ride those cars .
This example demonstrates that technology develpoment will give us more opportunity to ride a car .

Threfore , I strongly disagree with the opinion that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

In our communities we have poor and rich people but both of them can have a car because you can find expensive and cheap cars as you need , and if their any thing will replace the car , it will not be more suitable than the car for the people .

Now a days car is evrything and without car you cant live because it helps you to reach any place and to do what ever you want to do and to travel and it also help as in the emergency situtations .

In my opinion cars is agift from our god and if the inventors do what ever they do , they will not find any invention like the car or any invention to replace the car ,, becaue there isnt anything will be more comfortable for the hamanity than the car .

4745,828251.txt,P8,ZHO,medium,"I agree with this statement .
the people who want to be successful must do something speciall .
you ca n't just stay there and keep the thing you have already known .
The most important thing for a successful people is creative , you must do something that nobody did it before .
for example , at the early of the national basketball assosiation ( NBA ) , that time , every plyer all shoot without the jumping , i do n't know why they did n't shoot with the jump , maybe just because nobody thought about it , they all just stayed there in that little circle .
Then on day , somebody suddenly thought about it , why we ca n't shoot with jumping ?
If we jump , it hleps to close the hoop , and it also helps improve the shooting point , it 's harder to be blocked .
So , this person began to practice the jump shooting , and then he became a very good basketball player that time .
This is the story that really easy to see , why successful people try new things and take risks than only doing what they already know .
That player could just practice no jump shooting and became a good player , but he tried something new , and he changed basketball history .

i think `` try new things '' is a very important skill for a successful person , nobody can be successful without this skill .
when you learnning something , you just stay where you are , do n't go to blaze a new area , you are still just same as other people , you will never be successful .

Trying do something new is not that easy , when all the people doing same thing , only yourself against them or do something different , sometimes you will ask yourself are you doing the right things ?
But it must cost you something to be successful , you must do something different so you can be successful , do n't be normal as them , trying do something new .

7945,1225805.txt,P7,ZHO,medium,"In my opinion , I agree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
First , sometimes the what we see or hear is not the fact .
like long time ago people think the earth is a rectangle , because the roads are flat .
But after several years of searching and experience , now the fact become that the earth is like a ball .
So it is important to underatnad the ideas and concepts , then we wo n't be cheated by what we see by our limited vision .

Second , it is important to understand ideas and concepts because it 's the way for us to get the truth and concepts .
For example , after a stuent learned and understand the ideas and concepts , then they can use it to discover or create new stuff .
I think that 's why we envent lost of new things like car and plain to make our life easier .
So i believe that understand ideas and concepts are more important for student .

Third , it is more important for student to understand the ideas and concepts because in this way , student start to think , and become creative .
They can use their imagination to creat new ideas and conceptes , and their imagination is not limited by the facts .
It 's a good way to encourage student to search , think and find the answer they want .
So it is not that important to let the student learn the facts .

In conclusion , I believe that it is more important for student to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
Because in this way student can imagine and think freely , and creat new things that 's unique .
And it 's good for us to find the truth and real facts .

1716,293907.txt,P7,TEL,medium,"According to my point of view , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
Because even they do n't know the concept clearly it is not possible to solve any problem regarding topic .

Suppose we have a problem to solve , then first we have to understand the problem clearly and we have to think about ideas to solve the problem .
Then only we can solve the problem easily .
Even we know all facts about that problem , we ca n't do any thing .
For example , if student has given a puzzle to solve , then he knows all the facts about solving puzzle .
He knows all the rules in solving puzzle , without implementing any ideas he ca n't solve the problem .
The main purpose of implementation of ideas is to choose the shortest way and less time to solve that .
Here for the student not only to know the facts within the problem , he has to know the whole concept around the problem then only he would get new ideas which are to be implemented in solving the problem .
After the learning of concept about the problem we have to understand the ideas which have to be implemented insolving problem .

Not only to learn facts , definitely understanding and let them know the concepts .
The students who have learn facts , ca n't do anything without practical implementation .
we have to improve them from the learning stage in practical method in every aspects .
This practical method contains that understanding the concept clearly and thinking about the ideas to solve any thing .
Its better to prepare them mentallyt that they are in practically .
So as far as i concerncerned first thing for students is understanding the concept .
At finally i conclude it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

8101,1255150.txt,P7,TEL,medium,"I agree with the statement that students should understand ideas and concepts rather than learning facts .
Understanding ideas and concepts is important for students to acquire knowledge .
Once if the Student gets idea of the concept he can easily understand the fact .

Let us take an example regaring this statement .
suppose if a student has a brief idea of politics then he can understand what is going on in the present world and presenrt country .
He can even describe how is it going on and what is wrong and right .
I state that understanding concept is the main criteria of the subject or lecture .

If a student understands a concept throughly he can score good marks and he never forgets that concept and ideas in his life time .
This is the way of student to develop in his thinking and he can easily grasp the facts going around .
Ideas and concepts plays an important role in the present education system and present world .
Suppose if a person is having nill knowledge about politics it is difficult for him to understand the facts going around .
If he dont know what is the concept of work and energy he cant understand the common day to day activities .
Let us take english if a student dont know the language and alphabets of english it is difficult for him to learn grammer and spellings .
If a person has nill knowledge about a topic he cant write an essay .

Concepts and facts are very important in all acepts .
If he just learn facts he gets half knowlege of the concept .
He can understand only a part of the theory not totally and completely .

So i conclude that ideas and concepts play important role in understanding facts . ''
As great philospher said that half knowledge is always dangerous '' .

1319,219983.txt,P2,TUR,low,"Some people think that life is more beautiful when you get older , because they think that the elder people would be supposed to have experienced almost everything that a person ever could in her/his life .
They also think that spending time with the grandchildren is the most enjoying thing in the world .

Life is beautifel even you are younger .
If you are younger then you will be more energetic almost for everything .
You could do all the tiresome activities , you could run at the sea with your lover , you could dance with your lover till midnight and you would have the passion to make love with her/him .
I accept that there are some elder people who could run faster than some younger people or who could do harder activities , But they are exception and they are in minority .

Younger people also think that there is a long and happy life in future .

4190,728184.txt,P3,TEL,medium,"I completely disagree with the statement as a lot of young people who are the next leaders of the nation are not putting in enough efforts in to helping their community .
Life has become so fast in the twentyfirst century that peole are always busy running around not understanding what they want at the end of the day .
they are so busy with there studies there career and there futhur and the day to day stress they forget the very importance of building a community which would look after each other instead of places were there is a lot of crime , drug abuse etc. which would intern effect there personal life .

Young people these days are so self obsssesed that they dont have time to even think about there next family members .
They have a lot of time to go to movies or coffee place everyday and cant afford to take atleat an hour in a week to help their community .
this can be changed as in my case were proper guidence from the older generation and determination make a change in the community .

With proper motivation from the older generation this can be changed as was the case in my community when we in first moved to the community where i live now there was no proper waste disposal , people would just trow there waste in front of their neighbours house are on the roads which intern affected them with fly and mosqutioes .
To over come this problem we were advised by older people to come up with ideas to solve the problem , this led to sucusfull change in the waste , few of my freinds and me joined hands to collect funds in the colony bought a large bin that placed at one corner of the colony and every house had to dump there waste there and there would be the garbagge collectors to dispose the waste .
This was achevied due to the involvement of youth from the community .

If it made by law that every week a certin number hours are be spent doing community work by the youth i think the there would be a larger undersating and responsibility would be develpoved .
This is followed by the community in stay every month we donate funds to charity organistions like `` CRY '' from screening of movies , organisating events etc .

5133,893611.txt,P3,ITA,high,"I agree with the statement and there are many examples to support this idea .
Nowadays young people do not help their communities at all and inside the changes of society and culture can be found the answer of this behavior .
In my personal opinion , I think that the reasons for which young people do not help their communities are three .

First of all , it has become very common to live in cities which are not very small in size .
Living in a big city means that a young boy or girl do not have the usual places that there were in the past .
During the last decades , the church , for example , was the typical place where young people could help the others , for instance , they helped old people or the little community near the church .

Secondly , in the past it was usual to live in little houses and your neighbors became your friends and all this friendships formed a community in which everyone gave their help for the others , everyone did something to the overall benefit .
This was a great advantage because young people , living in this particular atmosphere , could see their work appreciated in the community which transformed itself in a big family .
Today this kind of situation is not possible because people usually live in a block of flats and everyone thinks only about his | her own bussiness , nobody thinks how can be important to have the possibility to have the help of the community .

Thirdly , today society and culture has changed very much and , of course , young people are changed too .
Every young boy or girl live in a world without the others , it menas that young people prefer to stay alone .
Nowadays young people thinks only about themselves , for example , about not intelligent things such as their games , their shoes or bags .
They are only concerned on them and not on other people and in particular on community .

In conclusion , all these three reasons can not explain this phenomenon in all its features , but can make easier to understand why young people are so far with their hearts from one of the most important thing inside the society : the community .

Who is already become a CEO .
He can keep doing what he is at best or he can try to find another area to seek success .
Definetely seeking the success in another field would be a dissappointment .
But it is better for him to find out what is there ?
The unknown is always attractive and if he achieve it great for him and the humanity .

Taking the risks rather than only doing what you do is basically not fun at all .
And if you are already good at it .
What is it to lose ?
If you could not .
Come back .
The door will always be open to a man or women who is successful in a job .
This process will effect the person 's creativity .
It gives the chance that if he or could make that miracle in another situation .
It is a challenge and a contest .

For instance our CEO in a company realizes that he always wanted to be a politician since he was a kid .
He could give it a try and try to get in the elections of next year .
It is a contest , not a beuty contest .
A contest which he will find his inner strength and get to know himself finally , who knows ?

1271,209944.txt,P5,KOR,high,"I agree that fewer cars will be in use in twenty years than there are today .
Although , cars are the main transportation currently , there are transporations we could use other than cars .
In addition , more inventions would be brought , and also because cars are one of the main factors that pollute our environment .

Every year , our society improves and evolve seeking for better way of living .
Two of the issues that are disliked from using cars are comfort and expense .
As we all know , cars are expensive to buy , especially good and well-known brand cars .
Great amount of money is also spent to maintain these cars for such reasons as oil fees and parking fee .
Moreover , as more people afford cars , there are lesser place to park cars and the parking fees would increase as a result of their demand , which make our life thougher .
Therefore , by the time of twenty years , more people would use other public transportations such as subway .

Secondly , people like innovations .
They prefer new technology , goods , and ideas , which leads to having new inviention of transportation other than cars .
Therefore , in the future , they might come up with new style of transportation which is similar to the cars we use nowadays , but that would no longer called cars anymore .

Lastly , the issue I consider here is health .
As more and more people afford cars , the more our environment would be polluted , which is n't what many people prefer .
This is obviously because pollution harms people by damaging their health .
Fortunately , people are getting sensitive about their health .
This phenomenon will possibly reduce the use of cars in twenty years .

Overall , as a human being , I prefer having comfortable life with spending less on cars , adore innovations , and having good health .
Therefore , in my perspective , I think fewer cars would be used in twenty years compare to the use today .

Every man goes through the young and old phase of his life or we might say most of them so he experiences almost everything .
I believe that young people more life than old people do .

You spend most quality time in young age compared to old age as this is started by you entering into teen age which also known as the crazy age as everyone does and experiences most of the crazy things in life at this age .
For example when you are young and enter college you are in a world of mischief a world you create on your own only for you to enjoy ignoring all the consequences you may have to face .
This is the first time you start bunking lectures on your own wish and go for movies , attending parties , you donot attend parties in old age .
Do you ?

Old people donot enjoy life as young people .
Most of the people in their old age are bedridden , having deseases , they hav undergone heart attack by this age .
This keeps you away from smoking , drinking and even dancing with your love ( your wife ) , in short the means to enjoy life .

Love reminds me that young age enjoys the joy of asking the girl out for a first time in your life .
It is a very joyous moment for the young guy experiencing it for the first time .
Later on in your life it becomes a habit and you want to take every girl on a date and shes ready if you are young .
Young people also get to experience the joy of the first day at work , everyone enjoys it and its different .
Then one day finally you get married to the girl you love and grow old with her and have kids .
All these happy moments are experienced when you are young .

However young people enjoy life not only because enjoying means being happy .
There is more to enjoyment than just happiness .
The dark side , when things start going wrong and you just cannot help it .
Many people are scared of experiencing such challenges in life .
I had a bad experince once in my life when everything atarted going wrong for me .
Nothing seemed to work and like everyone else i too was sad and depressed .
But i learned a lot from it .
My bad times taught me a lesson in life and if it wer n't for those bad times i would n't have been what i am today .
Pain they say is inevitable , so why not turn a masochist .
I have enjoyed my pain now and i feel what i am now , after what all happened to me gives me more joy than anything else in this world .

We can say that young age is the age when you start experiencing everything and old age is the age when you have experienced everything .
So experiencing is better than having experienced .

5028,876354.txt,P6,KOR,medium,"I strongly disagree with the best way to travel with tour guide .
When I was a kid , I went to sighting with my parents , relatives , and tour guide .
It was the worst experience which I have ever had .
Here are several reasons why traveling led by guide is so bad .

In begin with , traveling with guide is formed tightly because it is already planned before the start .
It cannot give you a free time .
Not only that , but you cannot afford to break even though you cannot buy only one present for your friends .
I think that one of the purposes which have a tour is relax without busy life .
If you go with guide , you will not get any fresh air .

Second , traveling in a group makes people angry .
It can be illustrated that some want to stay to focus on what they are interested , others have a desire to move another places because they do not need to observe anymore .
In this case , they have to decide what they will do .
But any group in this situation would be disappointed .

Finally , there is a famous maxim - If you travel alone , you are not alone .
It means that going trip alone allows you make frineds .
For instance , I went to Japan when I was a freshman in the university .
I had a traveling for a month .
I cannot speak Japanese fluently In that tour , I can make friends - Nakasaki , Murama , and Yorisimo .
It was an unfogettable experience .
When you are with your fellows , you cannot have chances to have new foreign friends .

As I mentioned above , I do n't like traveling in a group led by guide .
Fixed tour planning makes me exhausetd .
Group tour makes persons dissatisfied .
And if you can go somewhere alone , you can get friends .
On the contrary , if you are very old , you can like a group tour with a guide .
It makes sense that if you are satisfied with that , you are too old to feel free .

2562,446405.txt,P3,HIN,medium,"The issue is a controvertial one .
On one hand the issue states that there are young people who contributes to their communities .
On the other hand , the issue claims that young people are not helping their communities at all .
However in my final analysis , I would support that young people are giving enough time to help their communities .

The first instance in support of my view are the Non-Residential Indians .
They are young people who work outside India .
Inspite of there busy schedule , they come back to the home country and conduct lot of sessions .
They also help financial institutions in India by providing them financial aid .
They actively participate in the events and promotions done by the Government of India .

My second example are the young politians those are coming up in various countries .
People like Tony Blair of United Kingdon is a fascinating example of a young person helping his community and country .
Politics has now become one of the means by which young people are contributing .

Another example would be people like Michael Johnson from Basketball and Mark Waugh from Cricket .
These sports person have taken time out for child welfare .
They have also setup various sports academy , to help nourish young talent in their respective fields .

These people always make it a point to visit their respective academy .

Finally , the musicians like Yanni have conducted charitable shows .
Many other young musicians also conduct charitable shows to generate reveneues .
Singers like Michael Jakson is known for conducting such charitable shows .
This money is used for the development for their community .

In conclusion , I feel that young people of this era are actively participating for the cause to help their communities grow .
The above examples are just a few to quote .

3790,657932.txt,P8,SPA,medium,"In order to be a successful person many people have acomplished it by trying new ideas and taking risks .
Doing what you you already know to do will not take no anywhere if it is what most of the people do .

Many of the best inventions on the world were the outcome of risks taken by common people , just like you and me .
We should be more creative and not be afraid to try out new projects .
A short example to help me prove my point is the following : There is a man that has been doing the same work over and over again , his life dosent change .
He is good at what he does but just like him , many others are good as him .
If this man would try out new things of change some of the things he does in his normal rutine and find a way to be more efficiently , he could change his life .
He is the only person who can actually do this .

Taking risks is good to do once in a while .
Business men are known to be risk takers .
In a business , many decision have to be made .
Once simple decision can make a difference on the final outcome .
Some times you might have taken a risk that you didnt want , but it happens to be a sucess .
We should also learn from our mistakes in order to not make them again .
Also everyday we make simple decision with out even realizing it .
These decision can be things just like what you will wear that day or what you will eat .
For example , going to a restaurant and asking the waiter for a different plate of food which is not the one you normally would order .

Sometimes , your risk may not have been a success , but you may not loose anything .
As an old man once said , `` You loose 100 % of the shots you do not take . ''
"
9462,1521755.txt,P8,FRA,high,"The three main reasons I will talk about to explain why sucessfull people like taking risks are the fact that they trust themselves , that they like creting something from scratch and that they want to learn more and reach more money .

I would like to analyse successfull people who are people who already had a good experience and who managed to face their challenge successfully .
This is very important because those people know that they are able to handle complex issues .
And this will give you trust and insurance that will help you not to doubt in unknown situations .
See the example of cars manufacturer , you will easily attact a new market if you had been successfull on another one .
For instance , BMW has few doubts about its success by developping its SUV .

Then , there is the fact that people who had been successfull like , according to me , starting from scratch .
This is something very exciting not to see the route you will follow and discovering stape by stape your environment .
You can analyse people who create their own company .
They can choose the kind of products they sell , the way they pay their employees , the way you deal with the customers and so on .
And the most important point : you have no boss and you do not receive any orders thanks to the human size of your project .

Last but not least , people who succeed often know very well their domain ( this is why they succeed ) and this can explain their will to learn more about another field of technology .
For example , a company like Dassault which has made planes launched its own computer aided design software because it was able to afford it .
And when you have been successfull in a field , you often earn lot of money which enable you to invest in new challenge .

So this is , in my opinion , the three main reasons why successfull people like taking risks .
Because they trust themselves , because they know how to do and because they can do it .

3286,570409.txt,P7,TEL,medium,"I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

It is very important for students to understand things or ideas which are told by the teacher or parents .
The understanding ideas will be immensely benfitical to the students in many ways .
if the students having this capability to understand things they can acheive any thing , that means they can win in any feild .
This capability of understanding is also useful in their future .
I mean this understandability is useful while spending with their friends , and with their life partners .
If there is good understanding between friends and lifepartner , There is no possibility of clashes .

The students should having this understanding capability from their childhood .
The teachers and parents must having the responsibility of learning this capability to the childrens .

This understanding capability stands a person in very high position in the society .
thes kind of people can survive any where in the society .
And these kind of people can solve their problems and they can solve their neighbours problems also .
There by the people automatically give respect to them .
And there by they can increase their friend circle .
it is benfitical to them .

ILerning facts also important for the students .
But it takes lot of time for learning facts .
In this mean time people may do many mistakes .
Rather than learning , if the people having the capacity of understanding ideas there may be little chances to do the mistakes .
for example if we can understand if touch the fire , it burns , we never comit that mistake .
if we are not that capacity of undersatnding , the fire burns us .
Thats why the undersatnding capability is very important for students .

First , advertisers think what to do to sell more products everytime .
Advertisements are one of the way to sell products .
When the advertisers make advertisements , which advertisement is able to attract harts of consumuer products seem very good or not so much ?
Exactly prior one is able to get harts of the consumer .

Second , consumer might hesitate to buy products if the products seem worse than advertisements which they saw .
But first of all , advertisers have to meke consumer feel to buy products .
If the consumer do n't think to buy the products , they wo n't buy anything abslutoly .
Also , if advertisements are not able to attract consumer 's hart , the consumer wo n't think to buy products on the advertisements .
So advertisers have to attract the hart of the consumer first of all .

In conclution , advertisers want to sell much more products .
To do so , they have to attract harts of consumer .
It is needed by advertisers to make products seem much better than they really are on advertisements .

4031,698584.txt,P5,SPA,medium,"Nowadays , the quantity of cars is increasing very fast , but cars need petroleum and this resource is decreasing fast too .
For these reasons , we should ask ourselves if it will be possible to continue using cars in the future .

In my opinion , in twenty years there will be more cars than today , but the important difference will be that those cars will be more ecologic or they will use another resources than petroleum .

Firstly , it is not sostinable to keep the actual consume of petroleum for many years , so there will be a moment when we will have to find another energy sources for cars .
At the same time , new technologies are improving theirselves everyday , so in few years it will be possible to find a good alternative for petroleum and to invent new machines much more ecologic .
This means that the fact that petroleum will finish does not mean that cars will finish .

Futhermore , everyday cars are more necessary for people .
That is because , in modern societies , people need to move much more than before .
For example , many times some families have their home far away from their jobs or the education centers , so they need to drive a car to go to the workplace , to bring the kids to the school or to go shopping .

Finally , we have to know that many undeveloped countries , where now there are not many cars , are developing their economies and in the next years they will demand more cars for their population .

For these reasons , I think that in future , the quantity of cars will continue increasing , although , with the new technologies , cars will be ecologic .

4879,850163.txt,P8,TUR,high,"Everyone wants to be successfull .
However cooking a pitza is not a success .
The question is ` which accomplishment is a success ?
` .
An accomplishment is called success when it is something rare .
Success comes from trying and working for new , risky and higher level accomplishments .

First of all , a successfull person can not be the model of an old successfull person .
For example an architect builds an extra-ordinary building and create a new approach which is second to none in his area .
An other architect reads many articles about the above mentioned approach and builds a new building with the same style , or approach .
Which one would you like to call successfull ?
Of course the first one .

Secondly , accomplishing something which is already accomplished by someone else is not success .
Take the risk and try something harder !
As an example , one racer finishes the race in 5 minutes .
If the other one want to be successfull then he should risk his life and drive faster .
Moreover , in pc games the player is only successfull when he or she reaches the top score , which means he or she is better than the last player .

In contrast , some lazy people argues that doing the thing they know the best is the success .
I call them robots .
Do you see any difference ?
Robots are doing what they can do the best .
They are of course successfull in being a robot , however not a successfull human .

All in all , in my opinion there is a big difference between success and accomplishment .
Success is the new , risky and top level accomplishment .
Only doing what you already know how to do is next to nothing .

8593,1353003.txt,P1,JPN,medium,"Some people may think specializing in one specific subject is better .
However , personally , I believe it is better to have borad knowledge of many academic subjects .
There are two reasons for this .

The primary reason is that the new areas of academic subject have been created often by combining some subjects .
For example , portfolio magement theory which won Novel Prize was created by combination of mathmatics/statistics and economics .
If the resercher who won the prize was engaged only in traditional economics , it was impossible for him to develope this epochmaking theory .
In general , the evolution of the area of Finance theory has been depending on the combination of math , statistics , economics , phycology , and a lot of other subject .
This is quite good thing .

Another reason is that it is good for the future convenient of both students and proffessors to have broad knowledge .
In other words , broad knowledge increases the probability that they can turn their academic area into good direction .
For instance , one of my proffessors in university who has been an expert of computer science deveoped his career in new area , the law of patent .
While he has studied computer science , he has become aware that the new technology cannot alway be money .
The obstacle for him was the law of patent .
After being an expert of the law of patent , he is respected as an expert who can understand technology and the law related to patent .

Considering with all of the above factors , I would like to claim that we should aquire borad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than specialize in just one specific subject .
By aquiring broad knowledge of many academic subjects , we can increase the probability to create new academic area and to develope our career flexibly .

2341,404980.txt,P2,HIN,high,"Life is a series of experiences .
These experiences start from birth till life ends .
If a series of experiences are enjoyable , we percieve that part of our life as good .
If we went through a series of bad experiences , we percieve our life to be dull & bad .
Thus , the degree of enjoyment one encounters in life is a result of the quality of the sum of series of experiences one had in a lifetime .

I disagree to the statement , young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I strongly believe that the degree of enjoyment one experiences in life is dependent on various factors , the most important being one 's own mental-set .
For example : An old man woud rather be enjoying more , playing with his/her grandson than the grandson him/herself .

So , enjoyment is not based on age .
It is one 's own mind set & its ability to percieve things positively & appreciate them .
In turn it will result in an enjoyable experience .
Living life enjoyably is a skill .
It has to be learnt , either through experience or through knowledge .

The young people assume partying , going out with friends , seeing movie are the great enjoyments that they are experiencing .
But they are least exposed to the fact that these are only traces of happinees , just like bubbles on the water surface .
There are deeper , intense & more joyful moments in life .
The emotional happiness of spending lifetime with a partner is one of the deep enjoyments older people go possess .

With age comes maturity & stability to withhold happiness .
The experiences of life also provide the much wanted tolerance to older people .
This makes them a better knower of life , relationship & how to derive happiness from it .

In my opinion an older person is a better taster of different kinds of enjoyments in life .

6019,1027947.txt,P1,ITA,medium,"I disagree with the follwing statement .
In fact , i hope to become a person that i 'll be specialized in one specific subject .
Now , i 'm studying mechanic engineering at the university and when i 'll be finished , i 'm going to work in an industrial factory .
So this is one reason on about i do n't agree with that opinion .
In fact i have to learn always and always knowledgement about mechanic problems because this is a condition that it 'll let me to enter facily in the world of job .
So i still have to study more to reach that goal .
In spite of this consideration , to have broad knowledge of many subjects is a condition that can also give important results for the future .
To know other arguments such as economy , literature or foreign languages is another opportunity and , with this culture you can have interesting results to improve your career .
But i think that it 's better to know only a sector of own job .
Maybe , one explanation can be given .
Until i was a young boy and i was ten years old , i just had a clean idea about what i'be have wanted to do when i 'd have became an adult .
So i always wanted to be an engineer .
My father is an engineer and also my grandfather was an engineer and maybe this can be one factor of my choiche and of my opinion about this statement .

4462,775074.txt,P2,FRA,high,"Are young people happier than older ones ?
I think that this statement is the sad reality .
We 'll quickly see the arguments on the paper

Firstly , young people have much more occasions to make new friends than old people .
If you go out every week , if you 're invited at your friends ' places twice a week , your chances to meet new people are amazingly high .
The truth is that you only can and want to have this kind of life when you 're relatively young

Besides as a young personn you are not as involved in your family life as your parents might be .
You can spend the time you want with the people you really care about without thinking about the duties you need to do back home .

Studying abroad is an opportunity you ca n't miss .
With the increase of links between the earth nations it has became easier to study abroad than before .
As a result , today students have much more chances to go in a foreign country than their parents had .
Proof of this point the increasing students demand for the erasmus program and the strong relationships that universities maintain together .

Last but not least , old people have to work and secure an income to make sure that their family could live safely .
It 's not the case when dealing with young people that can do whatever they want as long as they are good at school at the end .
A young guy can relax as much as he want .
He even can leave school if he does n't like it .
An adult can not afford it .
He can not chill out because someone is counting on him : The young personn .

To conclude , I would like to say that we mus n't be blind , There are too many arguments in favour of the point supported in the paper and so few for the opposite point that the answer should be obvious .
Life is better when you are young .

10666,1740919.txt,P5,SPA,medium,"I not agree with the statement that says that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than today because of some reasonable reasons .

The main and most important reason I have to defend my opinion is that in twenty years the popullation would growth a lot , and not only in Africa where the birth-index is enormous also in Europe and in all America , and this is going to occur because of the inmigration , it could be legal or illegal , but all the countries are going to suffer the inmigration and migration proccess , instead of the laws and other inpediments governments will try .

The second reason why I feel there are not going to be fewer car in use in the future is that in twenty years scientists are not going to be able to find a new and innovate transport method , like flying cars or what else some people think we are going to have in few years .

Yeah , it 's true that some scientists have made a flying car but in the case they can comercialized it , it is going to be so expensive for the mid-people , so they are going to use the traditional cars .

The last reason I am going to talk about is not as important and relevant as the two others , it is the comodity .
Nowadays the comodity is a very important factor of our society , all the innovations in technology or in other subjects are to make more comfortable our life .
Moreover , we create things not to thinking more about what to create , those things we have create are going to do that job instead of us .

To sum up I have to say that I feel it is ridiculous to think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

1951,336952.txt,P2,FRA,medium,"Today , more and more often old people is showed by the society as slow and sad people .
But this point of view is really restrictive and cannot be share with everybody .

First , to my mind , the definition of `` enjoying life '' can change with your age : not because you cannot enjoy like before but just because your mind change .
For example , when you are a child , `` enjoying your life '' is just to play with your games .
When you begin to be a teenager `` enjoy life '' is to begin go in clubs , in bars .
When you are thirty years old , you need to enjoy life spending time with your friends or succeeding in your job .
I think when you are young , it is really hard to understand enjoying life of older people because you did not discover what they lived and what they need .
Then i think anybody need to enjoy his own life with his own dream or his own hobbies .

More when you become older , your body can accept everything it accept when you were young .
Something which was really sweet and so easy to do when you were young can become quickly hard and so strong .
Then a thing , you think in your childhood too hard or too string can become with your age really easy , funny or sweet .
For example , to do go in clubs or do extrem sports can become really hard when you are older , and to learn chess can become really enjoying when you are older .

To conclude , I do n't think every body can have the same one , because this term is linked to the target you gave to your life .
This target can change and is too much personnal to be shared with everybody .
And this is really hard for the different generation to understand why older or younger enjoying life with a another another activity which is not your view of `` enjoying life '' .

4542,788567.txt,P8,TUR,medium,"TAKING RISKS

Mostly people are afraid to take risk in their lives .
They prefer to live in safe .
That 's why they do not want to change their conditions .
But in my opinion people should take some risks to improve themselves .
There are many people who are successful take a lot of risks .
So successful people try new things and take risks : although some peole think that they only doing what they already know how to do well .

First of all , risks and new things expand the vision of people , because every new thing and risk brings new experiences .
By this experiences people can meet with different conditions and solutions .
So their vision is changed according to their experiences .
For example ; my father is an engineer .
When he graduated he went to Germany for his intership .
He worked as a worker in a building .
During his intership , he experienced and analised how he could built a strong building .
Now he has own company which is related with building structures .

Opponent argue that , successful people only doing what they already know how to do well .
Good productions bring success .
For this people should know how to do and improve it .
In this way , they do not need to take risks or experience new things , because they can maintain this from books .
It is unlikely to be true .
Books are not enough for improvement , because they only include theoritical knowledge .
In practice , experience is more neccessary instead of theorical knowledge .
Also by taking risks and trying new things , people improve their experience .

To sum up , if people want to be successful , they should try new things and take some risk .
By this , they can improve their abilities such as problem solving ability .
According to their experience and vision , they create their own practical solutions .

But in this more and more competitive society , even the new challeging and new experience of this world are no longer appearling as some old people may think , when compared to the high pressure we young adults received .
All the pressure : competition with classmates , competition with colleagues , and high pressure of taking care of a new family .

Competition in schools-from elementary school all the way to graduate level , now is heavy like no other period .
Everyone around seems like genius .
And even worse , the parents realise it .
The kids as aerly as only 3 or 4 years old , many are forced to go to take courses on piano , maths or professional athelet .
They live in the competition and do n't have the chance to play with the other kids , or to spend a whole weekend afternoon in the playground .
It actually has caused a lot of psychological problem of those kids .
For a deploma from a prestige college , many kids ca n't stand the high standard from the teachers and parents and commit suicide .
In my opinion , it wo n't be a life enjoyble for these students .

The recent time that I know the deadly competition for empolyment , is when talking to a 82 years old granny I met in a local park .
She told me she was very satisfied with her life now .
But the only thing she keep concering of is the work of her children .
One of them have a undergraduate degree , but cannot get a work with $ 60 USD a month .
The insurance is problem , the house rent is a problem , even the food becomes a main concern .
This probelm is facing many young adults , especially those who just go into the professional area .

Teenage mom is no longer news , and it thoroughly reflect a social problem when solving the family issue of young adults .
Most high school dropouts , if it 's not for the study problem , it 's the teenage moms .
They give birth to a new life , but also sacrifice their life to receive better education and better occupation .
Another feature odf modern society , is the age of newly marriage couple are getting older and older .
Everybody seems lost in the work , and rarely have time or energy to face the marriage and commitment .
Many guys in their 30s , do n't know anything about women , is no longer somthing rare , too .
When facing these big issues in life , young adults seem have very fragile feelings , and most of them are not happy with them .

As a result , young people are a social group experiencing high pressure from all aspects .
Their lives are not enjoyble .

Nowadays , everything is different .
If we compare today to two hundred years ago , we will see a lot of differences such as different cultures , people and places .
However , children never change .
They always have the feeling that they should never work and always play .

According to my experiences , I agree more with the following statement than I disagree .
Young people ( teenagers or children ) do not have the spirit for working or helping on anything .
They are mostly attracted to the computer games , movies , soccer , basketball and other things .
Therefore , it is not their fault that they do not do some things .
However , it is their responsiblity to do at least some of the things they have to do .

There are also other teenagers or children who are by far different from the people who always play computer games or watch TV Programmes .
These kind of people ( teenagers or children ) might be as young as other children but might be much more mature than the other .
These kind of young people usually give enough time to helping their communities .

However , young people not giving enough time to helping their communities might result from the parents .
The parents have a big role and effect on the life of the children .
If the parents always do what the child wants , then you would not expect that child to give enough time to helping his/her community .
If you get the child whatever he/she wants , then he/she will want more and more and you will buy more which will be a very bad influence on the child .
For example , I have few extremely rich friends .
These people always get what they want .
However , they are the ones who usually fail during school .
So I think the parents might also effect the children .

2439,423226.txt,P7,SPA,high,"LEARNING IDEAS FOR UNDERSTANDING FACTS

When students first start a course , they want to know what the methodology of the class is goin to be .
Students are interested in knowing the curriculum and the course description .
Once they know all of these details , the teacher helps them reach the proposed goals .
Every course a student attends , exposes him/her to learn facts and to understand ideas and concepts .
However , for students is more important understanding ideas and concepts than learning a certain fact .

Nowadays , there is an approach to teaching pedagogy called learning for understanding .
This approach , consists in acquiring knowledge through internalizing ideas and concepts .
In other words , the learning for understanding approach , stands that once a student is able to understand a concept or and idea , he will easily learn the facts that support it .

Although this approach is not directly exposed to the students , they unconsciously prefer to learn facts by understanding the concepts and ideas on which it is founded .
A student , finds it more interesting to discuss , to explore or simply to inquire on a theme .
Therefore , once they have a reason to research , they start to inquire .
In this way , students are able to learn from details , conjectures , opinions , concepts and ideas to be capable to reach the facts that support the investigation .

This is a kind of inductive method to acquire knowledge .
It can be boring for a student to start with theoretical facts just to discover new ideas , because the student will be first exposed to a list of theoretical concepts that may demotivate his learning process .
On the contrary , if the student is guided to an inquiry , he will be interested in questioning , exploring , debating and understanding facts .

Finally , the process of learning should captures a students ' attention with any kind of motivation , and what really motivates students is to understand ideas and concepts rather than learn a list of facts .
And this conclusion has to become a fact to keep in mind because this new approach can encourage teachers to change their pedagogic ass .

11107,1821153.txt,P2,ITA,high,"I believe that young people have the possibility to enjoy life much more than older ones .
Youngs usually have few phisycal constraints and see death and diseases much further than they actually are .
Old people additionally have the disadvantages of living in a world that has changed much since their time .

One reason I think that people have higher opportunities of enjoying their lives when they are younger is that they are healthy and strong .
They can live freely without worries for the future : they can try exciting sports like bunjee jumping or rock climbing .
Instead old men and women have to spend much of their time ( and money ) in visits at the doctor 's .
Many diseases related to elderly requires the use of drugs and medicines they would not be able to live without .
While youngs have no time to spend thinking about risks , the old men and women are often not even independent : they need somebody 's assistance .

Secondly the old people are living in an environment they are not even able to recognize !
The world changes so fast that grandfathers and grandmothers are unable to understand the social behaviours of their grandchildren .
I 've often tried to explain my grandmother the reason I do n't want to get married , but she just ca n't understand it !
Another aspect of this can be observed when comparing the number of old people who are able to use a computer with the number of electronic games sold to even some very young children .

Morever I truly believe that the most stimulating part of one 's life is the university time .
It is the period of my lifetime where I 'm increasing mostly the size of my knowledge and experience .
Everyday I meet new persons and I have the possibility to find many very interesting .
For example some professors are so wise that just the possibility to talk with them five minutes is a great chance .
Not many places are as precious as universities .

Thus I am sure that people can enjoy life more and better when they are young than when they are old .
I do n't think having a longer life is a good bargain : there is no point in leaving 100 years if the second half of it has to be passed on a bed or a chair dreaming about the past time or asking somebody to turn on the television .

yonger people are enjoyed by facing the day by day challenges in the school and college .
Young people will feel more happy when they achieve the target and they fell very sad when they fail .
Young people do not know how to earn money , because they dont bother about the money .
Older peoples have some limitations to do any activity in the society , because they all are experienced and thay all are already enjoyed the younger stage .
But young people can do any thing what thay want .
One famous scholer says that `` students can make the world and break the world '' .
I am very much intrested about this phrase because i am also a student .
iam also very much enjoying my younger stage .
iam studied up to tenth standard in my own village , i am toally enjoying with my friends at that time by going to school through the greenary plants on cycle .
And in the twelth standard i came to the city , here also i felt very happy by spending with friends .
In my engineering due to the age , i knowing the what happy and what sad .
Young people like me are so enjyoed theire lovely youngerness .
The older people have some responsibilities in the family .
They also enjoy the older stage by spending with the grand sons and grand daughters by sharing the affection and love .

2091,359904.txt,P5,ITA,medium,"As a matter of fact , we all can say that today there are plenty of cars all over the world , especially in big cities , but some people think that in twenty years there could be fewer cars in use than there are today .
I quite agree with these people for the reasons I am going to give following .

As a first point cars have made our lives more comfortable and nowadays moving is easier than in the past , but it is important to consider the huge quantity of pollution cars are producing .
Nowadays people take much more care of our environment than in the past , and I think that for this reason in the future different kinds of vehicles , moved by hidrogen , corn oil or electricity , will be avaible instead of cars .

Another point to consider is that in this century we have seen a rapidly increasing technological progress , that will surely lead to different kinds of transportation , like the flying vehicles we can see in so many fantascientific films , that will be of course a good alternative to cars .

Another important point to consider is that cities are getting larger and larger everyday , and every person who lives in a big city , as I do , can see how many hours we loose every day in traffic jams caused by the huge number of cars in use .
For this reason , I think that in twenty years people will probably buy more motorbikes and scooters , that are lighter and taht have better perfomances in traffic jams .

As a final point , nowadys people take a lot of care of their health and fitness and for this reason I think that they will start soon using bicicles and roller_skates to go to work or to schools , so that they could save the money of the fuel , avoid pollution and remain fit .

Concluding this short essay , I quite agree with the initial statement and I really hope that in the future we will live in a world free from cars , so that we and our children could live in a better way .

7894,1214316.txt,P7,JPN,medium,"I disagree with this idea because I do not think ideas and concepts are more important than the facts .
There are three reasons to support my opinion .
First , concepts and ideas are only needed to be well on their school .
Student have to understand the concept and idea to solve questions on their test .
But I do not think it is `` learnig '' .
Acutually , it is `` memorising '' .

Second , facts are the most important things in this world .
No one can deny any facts and break it .
We have to know the facts to be well on our sosiety .
If students understand only concepts or facts , they will be confused finaly .

Third , not only student also adults have to understand facts to understand it 's concepts and ideas .
In my opinion , nobody can understand completely the concepts and ideas without the facts .
That 's why they have to understand the facts first .

A lot of students are learning only concepts and ideas to be well on their school .
By this education , they cannot solve any irreguler questions even if it is using same idea as what they could solve before .
Because they do not know the fact for the problem that 's why they cannot enhance their knowledge .
Those students would be wondered that why they are using those concepts and ideas to solve their problems after they started to work on their major corces .
I think , people have to know the fact first to study what they interested in .

When I study something new for me , I am always wondered that why we are using this idea and how it is used to solve problems in acutual situations .
To solve these questions , we have to know the fact for the satatement .

From my opinion , I think the facts are more important than the concepts and ideas to solve our question or study what we are interested .
That 's why I disagree with the statement .

1789,308649.txt,P6,KOR,medium,"I used to like to go travel and almost my travel was followed a tour guide .
Even though I was very young I did n't want to having time with a tour guide because it was very uncomprotable for me .
I actually wanted having only our family .
So most of time I felt if I grow up in the future , I will go travel by myself .
Then dreams came ture .
When I became adult , I went to trip only me and my friend .
Throught that travel , I realized that traveling by my self is much better to see everywhere and without a guide trip made me a feeling of freedom travel , many experiences , and making new friends .

First of all , I could feel like freedom without a guide because I could visit more many places which is not expensive but more beautiful .
However , if I go travel with a guide , I can go only limited place and I will not feel trip , I will just take picture in ordet to show eveyone .

Second , I will get variety experiences .
If I go to French ,

Third , I can make new overseas friends .
Actually , many people have language problem , and it could be serious problem .
However , it could be chance to contect new people .
If I do n't feel dangerous or scared , I can have a question to native poeple .
Also it will help me to go more general place , which means native 's usual place , or if my new friends come to my contry , I will help them , either .

In short , I prefer to trip without a tour guide because I do n't want to

10806,1761198.txt,P7,FRA,medium,"The way for student to understand ideas is a really important thing if they want to succeed in life .
Some tend to understand the ideas and concept , but in an another way , there are some who perfer to understand only the facts .
Nowdays , it is true that most of them prefer to learn facts .
But in general , what is the best way ?

Personnaly , i do not think that learning only facts is the best solution .
Indeed , this type does not help us in our everyday life .
For example , in history , i do not think that learning only fact is enough to understand the mains points , they juste pick them out and forget them later , so the work is not using .
However , this kind of understanding can work sometimes of course , but one day , you will not be able to deal with any subject .

Now i am going to deal with what i think would be the best way to do in life .

First of all , comprehenssion is the base thing that everyone must learn and improve in his whose life .
Indeed , if you are able to understand the ideas and concepts , you will be self confident and all steps of your life would be easier for you to overcome .
For example , in school and espacilly in highschool , the best student are those who use their brain in this way , that 's we uselly say that they are clever .
By the way , a friend of mine understand only ideas , i mean , he works only with his memory .
Thus , he is not so well in school and i am better than fim because i focus on understanding the concerpt of things than learn facts .

Finally , we havve seen that is important for student to understand ideas and concepts .
Althought many people regard this way as a wrong thing , they are probably wrong .
Everybody who think like that should change .

5755,1004924.txt,P7,HIN,high,"I definitely agree with this statement .
Merely learning facts without a real uderstanding of its true meaning is of no use in my opinion .
One can have all the knowledge in the world but at the same time can be incapable of putting it to any use .
What use is all that knowlege if it ca n't bring about any favourable results !

To Support by absolute agreement with this statement i am going to tell u about an experience of mine that taught me about the relevance of having a complete understanding as to just knowing the terms .
When i was in the 7th grade my parents migrated to the U.S. from India .
Till then i had only been exposed to the Indian ways of education .
Out here in India we were taught that the only thing that mattered when it came to academics , was how much of text have we been able to mug up .
It did not matter whether we actually understood it .
The only thing that counted was whether we were able to reproduce it while being tested for it .
Inevitably , all the data that was memorised was instantly forgotten on the completion of the test .

Initially when i started studying in the U.S. , the Indian method of education worked as a hindrance in being able to adapt to the American style of learning .
In America Education meant leaning the understanding of ideas and concepts .
With the right understanding one would be capable of accessing information related to a particular topic .
A simple action of accessing innformation posed itself as a huge task for me .
As i had been used to only reproducing without having any understanding of things , I was completely handicapped and did n't know where to begin from .
It was this lesson that taught me the necessity of comprehending things over mere memorising .
One is better of comprehending less matter as compared to having a whole lot of facts stacked up , which one is incapable of putting to use .

Do n't get me wrong here .
I do not mean to condemn my country 's method of education .
What i 'm trying to say here is that , my country should cultivate this statement of `` it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts '' into its academics .

11141,1826665.txt,P3,DEU,medium,"I agree with the statement that young peole do not give enough time to helping their communities .
But first of in my opinion this is not a problem of the youth , it is a problem of the society in general .
Communitys and Groubs seem to disappear or be less steady .
Often there is no deep connection anymore , somehow more artificial .
So how should the youth help more in communitys when they does not seem to be realy involved ?

For example the family system has changed masively during the years .
Some years ago the grandparents used to live in the household together with their children and the childrens ' offspring .
So the contact between children and their grandparents was mutch closer .
As a result the teens more often helped to take care of the ill grandparents lying in their bad .

On top of that not all young people went to school espacially the girls often only should work in the house so they had more time to hely in the community ` family ' than for example the girls today .
So in these days the young people lived in different conditios so in my opinion it is difficult to compare the young peoples action in a comunity in the past and in the present .

So all in all the whole society became more anonymious .
On the one hand the people have more freedom and on the other hand they are less bound to social groups or communities and these logically has an efect on their behaviour .
So to my mind this feeling of beeing not responsible for the comunity is not a caracteruistic of the youth instead it 's a caracteristic of the whole society .
On top of that the best help that a young person could do for his community and country is to be well educoated and get a good job to be able to pay taxes for the community and to create new jobopertunuties for others .
But finallzy i want to add that it can not be wrong if there would be more volunteer social work

8546,1344823.txt,P8,ITA,medium,"I completely agree with the statement .
I think that the only way to be successful is to fix a target and , once it has been achieved , to move it forward and try to get it again , even if there are a lot of possibilities to drop .

Many people think that the fortune has a big role to the way of success and I agree with them but I also think that fortune kisses just few people .

I also think that success has not to be , always , linked to the money : there are a lot of good examples of doctors who are , of course , success person , but they are not rich as a big manager or owner of a multinational company .

I also do n't think that success people are better than not-success people : there are people that naturally tend to the success and others that judge their life good enough without any kind of success .
It happens that not-success people are happier than the others .

I think I 'm a person who is forced to tend to the success : I do n't want a normal life as a lot of my friends have .
I 'm fighting every day , fixing targets , sometimes impossible to get , in order to be able one day to say : `` OK , that ' s enough for me '' .
I absolutely do n't think to be better than the others , as I said before , but I feel inside something that pushes me forward every single day : it 's not a good sensation because there 's always something I have to do or to run for .
After the University , I moved to China for work : it has been a big chance for meut a lot of my friends disagreed with my choise because China was too far and I did n't need to go there to have a job .
The problem was that I did n't want a normal job and it 's exacty what success people want : they want to do something that is not common to other people in order to build a good career .

11774,1938167.txt,P2,FRA,medium,"It 's clearly known that young people play more often than older people .
But does it means that babies and adolescents enjoy life more than their parents or their grand parents ?

I do n't think so for my part .
I do n't think that enjoying your life can only be restricted to going to parties , playing video games and taking a maximum of risk for yourself .
It really that which mainly differ young people behaviors from older people behaviors .
Many youngs think that you enjoy life when you constantly confronte your life with danger .
It 's really strange , because by definition , danger can easily catches out your life .
But it 's what many young people choose to take conscious that they are alive .

What it is essential to enjoy your life , is to have some interest points .
And I think that older people often have many .
They are often more prudents but it does n't prevent them from having hudge amount of things that they love to do .
Basically , what count is the pleasure that you are feeling when you are doing something that you like .
If it 's the case , you enjoy your life .
If a 70 years old man gets pleasure when he stays hours and hours near a lake by waiting a fish with his fisher line , it 's his fully right .
A 20 years old young man could find it so boring , but maybe the old man would find boring to go to one of his techno parties .

As a conclusion , when you grow the only thing that may change is the way that you evaluate danger .
Of course your behavior changes according to this changement in your mind .
It would be a pity for every children , if they already know that they wo n't enjoy life anymore when they will be older

8435,1322085.txt,P3,TEL,medium,"The world at present seems to be a technologically innovated place every individual find no gap to spendfor himself .
Inthis fast running world every individual should be quick enough to grab the oppurtunity he might get .
This is the case , which implies to the young people also because as these people going to start their career in this world .
I strongly agree that young people are not able to find their time to help thier community .
This essay look after the reasons why these people does n't find time to help community .

At first , now a days the money being the main criteria of living people are working to earn more money as they can to live happily .
This is the case where the young people stumbles .
As they start their new career they run after work which get them more money .
They have been new to tthis kind of life they weremore entusiastic in earning money .

Secondly , they being new they have less money in their pockets so they are eager to earn money which makes them a working monsters .
As their mindes were coming out of the narrow shells of knowledge the companies are exploiting these young people by making them to work .
This eventually makes less time to kick back on their bed also .

Finally , these young people being ambitious and energitics , they are intrested to work more fullfill thair needs .
These people are also fascinated to many costliy thing and luxeries they find in movies .
So , to get these thing they tend to work more .
Being at the young age they are not bothered of the world they do think for themselves .
These young people has rebelion way of thinking they are stubborn to their beleifs .
So , they donot care of their community .

In summary , it is the main fact that in money driven world young people are influenced by money so that they are not bothered of their community and not intrested in helping thier community .

11360,1866699.txt,P8,FRA,high,"Generally , innovation is better than just sticking with what you know to work well ; it is the way of evolution .
But it is still important to stay within an area of specialization when you try new ways to accomplish your goals .
That is to say , overdiversification can hurt your chances of success because you will not be as good with everything you can do , as opposed as when you are specialized .

But , when you try new experiences , you acquire a new perspective on life , and you may find solutions and ideas that help you succeed better in your own field of study .
Of course , taking risks is a gamble , because then you can lose everything you have already accomplished , so taking risks can lead to more stress in your life .
In turn this stress is a hindrance on performance , which just increases your chances of failure .
It is for this reason that you must still have a clear plan of action when you take risks .
Organizational skills come in handy to draw up a clear plan of action , defining what your objectives are , what you seek to accomplish .

So , we could say that the risk has to be calculated for it to be a good policy .
Indeed , if the consequences of failure are not known before you start a new initiative , this initiative has a very good chance of hurting you a lot more if it fails than if you had planned : after all , you may not be able to recoup the losses incurred by such a failure .

Which means , taking risks and trying new things are the way to success , but you must not embark on such entreprises carelessly , without due consideration of the consequences , or you may end up much less successful than if you had just stuck with what you already knew !

4665,811412.txt,P5,FRA,high,"As the whole world is confronted to pollution , some decisions and reglementations have to be made to avoid the environmemtal destruction .
Cars are very concerned by these new measures and they are bound to be fewer in twenty years .

First , the trend , in most cities is to develop buses and subways to encourage people to use it instead of using their own car .
It has two advantages : the reduction of pollution and traffic .

Moreover , sometimes , when the pollution reach a certain level , the circulation of cars is forbiden .
If the pollution continue to increase , in twenty years , cars will not be allowed to enter cities .
Cars will disapear .

Some cities have begun to take big measures .
London for example rules the circulation in the center of the town .
People have to let their cars in the suburbs aroud the city and to take the bus .

It can be surprising but it could be the case of many cities in about twenty years .
However , it still remaims a problem with trucks , we can not ask the buses to deliver the goods .
Maybe , we can find a solution with new energies .
Experts say they can produce oil with vegetables but not for the entire planet .
What about focusing on trucks ?

Besides , most of the car 's companies try to adapt their cars to environmemtal reglementations because they know they are threatened .
Some try to reduce the pollution produced by cars , other to make them function with electricity .

I think people have to get used to a new way to travel .
By buses in the cities , by train to go from one city to another , by plane to travel abroad , by boat to cross the oceans , etc .
Everything follow this trend : Transports are more and more developped and less expensive .
Look at the buses : they can bring you everywhere

To conclude I do not expect a great futur for cars .
Behaviours are starting to change : people travel a lot more by train than they used to .

10658,1738687.txt,P4,JPN,medium,"I think the most advertisements are made to look the products much better than they really are .
They make the ad or TV commercials intensionally attract the customer by emphasizing a certain poing of products .

Typical example is , I think , an advertisements of car .
One commercial that I felt like I missed the poing was the one ; a man at the groccary casher looks at what he was going to buy and what the other man is going to .
He got vegitables and a pack of big in Tofu in his cart and the other man has huge bulk of beef .
After that he rushes into a car dealere and buys a big car .
An impression that I had from this TV commercial is , `` Get a big car , get your dignity . ''
But the car eats gas like a monster .

In these days , especiall after the midle-east crisis , the gas efficiency is one of the most important elements when you choose which car you perchase .
More people concern about efficiency much more they used to before .

I believe that the car company ought to forcus on what the era require them to make and respond what poeple need .
The ad does n't show anything like that but encourage people to reverse the flow of the current .
We , comsumers need to be smart enough to read what they show and what they hide behind the advertisement .

3507,608197.txt,P5,TUR,medium,"There are advantages and disadvantages of cars .
I 'll be discus advantages and disadvantages of cars .

First we look advantages of cars .
Cars are important and they give us the power of transportation at the time we want .
And also car creats a private place like houses .
Cars are flexible .
For example , if i want to go holiday now , i can use my car and i do n't need to wait any bus or train .
They are protect us crowded of mass tranportation .
And using a car gives freedom feeling .
When you drive your car , you feel that you can go everywhere .
Now new technologies are created and cars are going to more echonomic .
New cars are working with natural sources like electicity and they are friend of nature .
They work more slience .
They are building with recycleble and stronger materials .
Car porduces thinks drivers safety and modern cars are very safe .
In 20 years cars will be more trustable and safer than today .

On the other hand , mass transportation rising .
Lots of people uses mass transportation and every day more people uses mass transportation .
The people choose it because save lots of time it is faster than using own car and it is more echonomic .
There lots of alternative , for example train , bus , metro .
They save us the trafic caos .
If i want to go center of city i choose always metro because it is very hard to drive car in traffic and driving car takes more time .
One more disadvantage of cars , they rise up the pollution level .
Cars are more dangerous than mass transportation .
There are lots of people dies every day because of human errors .
May be future cars will be more trustable but there will be always human factor .
Human makes errors very easy .

Finally , i agree the topic .
people will see the advantages of mass transportatin and disadvantages of cars .
i also think that in twenty years there will be fever cars in use than there are today ...

Transport politics of the world are survival .
We give more importance to trains metros and other big transporters .
We also follow rules to reducing emission gas .
So we aim to decrease the quantity of cars .
If governments supply more finance and services to transportation problem then they can solve this problem with mass-transportation .
They can build more ways to trains and metros for example from street to street .
Transportation will be more speedy and cheapier so people will select to travel with mass-transportation instead of cars .

On the other way car industry is improving day by day .
They supply various technology selections and prices .
In that important point , governments have the big responsibility of this subject .
Governments should balance car industry and mass-transportation industry .
By this way big volume of society can select speedy and cheaper solution , mass-transportation .
The rich and little volume of society can select private and expensive solution , .
This implementation also support reducing emission gas .

Even though the technology is fast improving , there are major problem remaing which is increasing of cars that polluting our enviroments .
I cast doubt that twenty years is too short time to prove the problem .

First , the speed of developement in technology is unbelievably fast .
No one thought that they can talk to each other and see each other in same time with the wireless phone .
However , with the technology have so far , only will be able to create another cars such as flying cars or cars that can go under the water .
This could not be the solution as the amount of cars will be same as now or even more .
It will be great improvement but would not help the problem of pollution by cars .

Secondly , last twenty years there has been dramatic difference on tranfer matters , dI believe that twenty years is too short time to think whether amount of cars will decrease .
I strongly believe that one day it will ; however with the technology we have at the moment , can not solve this problem .

In conclusion , we are having pollution problems because of increasing number of cars such as air pollution , nose pollution .
With the technology keep developing , one day amount of cars will decrease or even disappear by using new way of trans .

5846,1012412.txt,P2,HIN,medium,"I agree with statement that young people enjoy life more than old people .
the term of youth is believed as the beautiful time in our life this theory itself prooves that young do enjoy a lot more than old .

Enjoyment can be considered as the invisible sibling of zeal .
energy generates from the enthusiasm towards ones life .
as young people will be healthy they will be active and energitic resulting in interest towards enjoying the life .
generally they follow in the logic that ` get busy in living or get busy in dying ' .

Young people never satisfies with their existing capabilities they enjoy in achieving intermediate goals .
that too , as the young never feels their responsibilties , out of their ignorance they enjoy with their freinds and by their own style of enjoying their life .
As the old people feel very responsible they come under pressure and will be vexed with their life and never think in a positive way .
they try to complicate their problems unknowingly as they are annoyed .

young people think with a great flexibilty and they feels very free with out any mental tensions as they take every thing in a positive way .
as they come across so many fields and new advancments in those respective fields , they enjoy in learning them and in spreading their knowledge .

As there are so many innovations in the field of technology they try to capitalise the advantages of those gadgets and devices and get entertained themselves .
enjoyment can be defined mathematically as ( goodhealth + zeal + energy + optimism ) .
these four things can be considered as the variables .
where these features are in bundle in the young people .

By the above discussiuon we can clearly visualize that young people enjoy more than old people which is an uncontaricted truth .

The students main aspect of learning things is by understanding the facts beside it and the other way is to understand the ideas and concepts about it .

In olden days student used to learn things by learning the facts about the things which they are going to learn , As it certainly takes more time to learn a particular subject as they i has to know what actually the subject is and how it is going to work , but it is time consuming thing to learn a particular subject .

while coming to learning subject by knowing or understanding the ideas and concepts about the subject is the better way how to students understand about the subject and solve them easily .

let us consiber an example to solve an mathematical problem to find the area of the given triangle , which is given to two different students in the class , who can solve the problem by knowing the facts and the other student who understand ideas and concepts of the problem .
response who knows the facts of the problem and the student who understand about the ideas and concepts .
The student who know the concepts and idea about the triangle can do better and fast by using the formula of the triangle , but the student who known about the basics i.e facts about the triangle will take more time .

In this developing and competional world one should be more effecient and more faster to survive in their life .
so in my opinoun the student who understand ideas and concepts is more important than the students who learn facts so as to face different compitative exams which are likely to held in every part of the life , where they test only the output of the student rather than how much he knows about facts

2306,398252.txt,P2,DEU,high,"Although older people may enjoy their retirement and have gained a great amount of moneyto spend , I prefer to experience the life as a young persons usually do .
In the first place , young people do not have to deal with many illnesses .
They are healthy and can spend their life with activities .
For example , they join sports clubs or enjoy bungee jumping while older people may have to deal with cancer and have to stay at home or in hospital .

Second , patterning your further life appear to be an interesting stage of life .
As a young adult one decide on studying or making an apprenticeship with a company .
This decision-making process affects one 's whole future .
Beside that young people choose a marriage partner and search friends , who they may have contact with the rest of their life .
Consequently this period is very exciting and requires much engagement ; however , it offers the great opportunity to choose from all the options , which lay in one 's ability .

Third , there probably would never be a time , in which one can so easily make new friends .
For example , I as a student met so many different people at university and sustain the possibility to learn from them or experience a whole new culture .
I as a student for example have amazing friends from Turkey and Spain .
Beside that one can spend time with attending parties and joining clubs offered by university or another organization .

Finally , young people are mostly only responsible for their own life and can decide on everything without caring about husband , wife or children .
This offers a significant background for self-realization .
During this beneficial time a student maybe choose to study abroad , an option which will offer both , personal and academic enrichment .

Consequently , I enjoy being a young person with all options but less responsibility and an interesting freetime

9698,1567661.txt,P2,ZHO,medium,"In my opion , i agree that young people exactly enjot life more than older people do .

Firstly , physical conditions .
For the young , they have long lasting energy than the old .
So , this objective factor makes the young to endure lots of fun but exciting facilities that old people ca n't not stand .
Such as : roller coster , pirate ships .
In addition to this , the old ca n't experience coloful night life that is most attractive to the young .
Because of their aging , tensive dancing , alcohol and sound intensity even prohibit them form entering a club !
Thus , they do n't have power to enjoy exciting life even though they are willing to .

Secondly , beacuse they are old , they may ragard themselves as a kind of people that have already experienced a lot of things .
They will not be interested to enjoy life anymore , what they want is to have a peaceful and quite environment to live for the rest of their life .
Thus , they may always lie on bed or being alone all the time , without crowd , where should the enjoyment come from ?
Moreover , they may generate the fear or sorrow feeling of death instead of happiness .
So , psychologically , the havelost the ability to enjoy a life !
However , the young wo n't consider about the future too much , their attitude would be to `` enjoy life as much as possible , beacuse i 'm still young and energetic , otherwise , it will be a waste of my awesom energy .
So , they hang out with friends , play large varieties of activities crazily .

Finally , the society merely provides enjoyment to the old .
The old once again lose a source of happiness compared to the young .
As we all know , there are uncountable clubs , amusement parks , shopping malls as along streets , but none of them are suitable for the old to enjoy .
The lack of old people activity sites as infrustructures combines with reasons stated previously create this social factor that contributes the most significant reason for the old ca n't not enjoy life more than young people .
This can be also attributes to the notion that people care less about the old than the young .
The young are future , the old are remnants .
"
7307,1142409.txt,P2,DEU,high,"First of all , there has to be a definition of `` young '' and `` old '' .
A twenty-year old person will consider himself as being `` old '' when he compares his age to that of a newborn .
On the other hand , a 70 year-old person will think of the 20 year old person as being `` young '' .

I assume that the statement on the left thinks of people in their twenites or thirties as `` young people '' and that seniors at the age of around 60 are referred to as `` old people '' .

I believe that it is impossible to make a `` Yes '' or `` No '' decision on that question .
Of course , the general idea of `` enjoying life '' is that of having parties , drinking alcohol , making new friends and not having any concerns about the future .
All of these activities are much more typical of younger people than of older people .
Younger people simply do n't spend too much time thinking about the future , they `` live for the moment '' .
In that regard , the statement on the left is right .

Once people have grown , they tend to take on more responsibilities and duties in their lifes .
Older people have to supply some financial income , maybe not only for themselves , but also for their family .
They have to take care of their social life which seems a lot more complicated than in the younger days , and they might also have growing concerns about their health .
All of these factors do n't really make it `` fun '' to be older .

On the other hand , being old also means being wiser .
When you 've reached a certain age , you are able to define the true values of life .
And generally , these values are not parties , alcohol or superficial friendships .
The true values are much more intimate .
They are in things like having one best friend , being rewarded at work or just being loved by your partner or your kids .
Having a loving wife for example can be the best `` fun '' you 'll ever have in your life , although people normally would n't call it `` fun '' , but `` fullfillment '' instead .

But this detail would lead to another discussion about the definition of `` fun '' .
My conclusion is , that - just as life does - the definition of `` enjoying life '' changes during the years of a lifetime .
"
10257,1668009.txt,P2,TUR,medium,"Enjoying life is not always directly related with the ages .
Its actually requires both skills to be more dynamic as most of the young people do and to have more encourage as the older people have by their life experience .

Maybe the word of dynamizm may not be enough to explain how is important to have a certain attitute to enjoying life .
The one first must be peacefull with own and with surrounding .
Then self-confidence becames and it makes the people more relax .
Since most of the young people has much less concern to worry about than I agree the young people has more potential to enjoy life .

Also the chemically wise that for sure there is much more activity in the body of young people .
It might help to be more healty and dynamic and makes easy to live .
Even emotionally , it is correct that the younger people are more active than the older ones .

Do you think , all these fact says us that the younger people can enjoy life more than older ones ?
Mostly but not entirely .
There might be still something missing I guess .

Young people are more suitable to get dissapointed by intersections between their great expectation due to huge imaginations and the concrete tough rules of the reality of life .
They are also more attent to take weong decitions due to their blowing blood and rush of everythin .
How the people can be happy with this dilemma ?

Here the life experience comes as a solution .
While the one gets more and more experience form the life - mostly the bad ones - then gain more abilit to evaluate better the conditions and to take better decisions ,

So finally it would be better to be a older who have younger blood .

1926,332386.txt,P7,HIN,medium,"`` Understanding gives you a better clarity and vision rather than learning facts '' , i agree to the point that understanding ideas and concepts has a better results than simply learning it .
When you are learning the facts , what exactly happens is that if you are not repeating it again and again you tend to forget the concepts and ideas .
In learning you try to memorise the text without looking at it 's practical implemntation and after a period of time it gets vanished .
learning could be lucrative only when you have to swallow things Like .
In history , where you have to learn the time and series of events that has happened in past .
But in creative and intelectual subjects like .
Science , Arts , Mathematics it is not good to simply learn things because these areas need you to understnad the ideas and concepts .

In understanding the ideas and concepts yoy use the creative , active and imaginative part of your brain .
When you understand something you do n't have to push yourself to revise it again .
Taking `` Mathematics '' as example when you understand the concept geomatry , than only you will be able to use it properly and efficiently .
Understanding the ideas and concept opens your brain to see every part of the subject .
and after doing a brainstorm with urself you understands the fact which you never forget .
Understanding a concept is easier to do than learning it .
It is often seen that students focus more on learning things than understanding because they have their exams pressure on them .

At last i would suggest that the dynamcis of an educational course should emphasis more on giving a better understanding .
when an individual understand a concept it comes into his behaviour .
learning is like looking at the ocean from a distance and understanding is more about enjoying the depth of it .

4577,794599.txt,P4,TUR,high,"It is quite true that the advertisement companies are all over the world today and making a great improvement by enabling the companies to increase the amount of the product they sell and consequently the profit they get .
Obviously , advertising have become a huge industry , which attracts the attention of all companies producing various kind of goods for different purposes and for different target consumers or clients .

However , it is still questionable to what extent advertisements reflect the real quality of a certain product .
By remembering the kinds of advertisements which were in display almost fifty years ago , we can easily conclude that the early examples were not that much exaggerated or confusing .
They simply described the product or the service with a nice background music .
Later on more story-like advertisements , which aim to influence the audience emotionally , were produced because an emotional kind of attachment with a certain product or service renders it more likey to be remembered .

A close look at the recent kinds of advertisements on TVs or radios reveals the fact that today 's advertisements are far from reflecting the real quality of a product .
Many customers complain that they are not satisfied with the product or the service they receive and they believed that they are fooled by the shiny advertisements .
Majority of the people who watches TV at night tend to change the channel when an advertisement is shown because it is believed that it does not describe the product or the service objectively .

Additionally , it became quite difficult to understand the story - like advertisements because they divert our attention to the other details instead of the product itself .
One can feel as if he/she is watching a fashion show while watching a car advertisement .

Fortunately , some rules and regulations put forward to restrict the unrealistic depictions of the products in advertisements .
Recently certain instutions are established enabling customers to defend their rights if they are fooled by advertisements .

1266,208932.txt,P3,ARA,medium,"Young People and Their Communities

Young people have the ability and the time to do many things for their communities but nowadays they are busy in other things like playing games , watching TV , spending too much time with friends .
I agree with that statement because of the following reasons : They think that the othe things ( playing , watching TV , ...
ets ) more important than helping their communities ; and they think that the young people themselves need help from their communitis .

Many young people are interested in the computers and video games , internet , wathing TV and movies , and visiting friend and spend much time with them .
So they are very busy with these things and they ca n't find time to help their communities .

Also the young people think that they themselves need their communities help by giving them advise by the older people about studying in universies and how they can choose a good univerdity and a good major .
Also they want to learn from the experts .
Those experts are usually from the old people .

Moreover , we have to give the young people a feeling that they are men we can depend on them .
And if they feel that , they may provide help to their communities .
For ecxample , if you deal with ayoung person as a chile he will hate you and the community and wo n't help you .

For these reasons I think that young people do n't give enough time to help their communities .
But if we provide advise for those young people they will help their communities but when they get older .

6769,1092963.txt,P7,KOR,medium,"Korean parents , who has traditionally shown huge intersts on childern 's education , seem to be competing to send their chidren to most munber of private academies .
I should admit that childern should accumulate a lot of knowlege to understand the world , or the lead a successful life in the futer .
However , I believe that more emphasis should be put on understanding the ideas and concepts .

First of all , compulsion of acquiring lots of knowledge will make the student lose the interests on the subject they 're studying .
When a student is force to go to several privite academies by his mom 's wish like one of my students , she wo n't have chance to consider what I want to know the most .
As a matter of a fact , the student spents lots of time studying English , math and science but all she wishes about the academies is to quit them .

Moreover , just gaining more knowlede beyond the student 's understanding is not efficient at all .
For example , another student of the academy where I teach , should take 3 coursed every day .
Of course , it is not by his will but by his mom 's wish .
In spite of the amount of time he spends at the academy , he fails to show decent understanding for any of the classes .
Because he takes too much , he is having a hard time understanding the lessons .

Undoubtedly , having a lot of knowledge is very useful and important .
However , I believe the study process should follow the steps neede to be efficient .
Students should have chance to learn about what it is like .
For that they should understand the field .

385,68678.txt,P8,HIN,medium,"I do agree with the statement that `` successful people try new things and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .
Its every persons dream to become successful in life by doing some thing great for the society and mainting the same standards for long span of time .
One had to risks his everything to create some thing new , which has value and which is useful for the people in general .
New things would never discovered or come in to existence if the person like Edison , Ghram Bell and Nicolas Tesla would have risks there all possesion for there new inventions .

Thomas Edison and Nicolas Tesla were already famous for there discoveries in thier respective field like electric bulb , electrical printing press and A.C current generation and transportation of electrical current over the long distance .
These things have become essential for the human society and play great role in day to day life .
But , never did Edison or Tesla left these things there but worked over it to make it more successful .
Due to these great people thinking and risk we have new way of A.C current generation and transportation , the Inducation motor which has great impact at that time of era .
Due to there new discoveries they are more sucessful then the fellow scientist of their time because they never gave up things what they thought .

Though it takes long time for people to understand the new technology and utilize it to its full potential but that does n't mean that people should stop trying new things and stop risking lot for new discoveries .
In todays world technology development are at its higest level but there is yet new discoveries had to be done , Successful person like L.N.Mittal who never gave up or stop risking his fortune for accuring new company .
It was his dream to become the single largest steel producer or the world he did it via risking it .

i think that people should never stop risking things to become more successful .

1118,184250.txt,P8,TEL,medium,"Succes means to invent new things , which can be done by experiments and taking risks .
It 's not only restricted to succesful people rather than to all people who are failure too .
As succes comes only by experincing opposite results .
It will be new experience if we take risks and invent new things .
This boosts our confidence and gives a new experience .
I agree that succesful people try new things rather than doing what they already knew .

Firstly succesful people try new things because as already they tasted succes in their life this gives confidence to work more by taking risks .
Scientists are good examples for taking risks and trying new things .
If scientists does n't try news things then we wont be able to access the inventions which they made like pencillin , steam engine by james watt , aeroplane by wright brother and so on .

Secondly people try new things in which they get new experience .
If a person is doing a know work for a past few years this not only makes him boring but also losses his interest in that work .

While experimenting new things we can get more knowledge in the subject which gives us soul satisfaction .

Today we recognise scientists by their works , but we do n't recognise a daily worker in a factory .
Experiments are done by taking risks like astromer who take high risks while travelling other planets or solar system , in between they may loose their life 's by having collision with other planets or by some technical problems .
Best example for this is the well know astrnomer Kalpana chawla , who did a various experiments by taking risks .
Her experiments to land in space gave huge information of which a common people is not familiar with .

An intellectual person is well recognised by his works .
A person is seen by his achievements which he had contributed to society Hence , I totally agree that succesful people try new try things and take risks to invent new things for social well being .

6864,1101357.txt,P8,ITA,medium,"In my opinion , trying new things or taking some risk rather than doing what is already know , or what a person already know how to do well , could be positive or negative , it depends , first of all from the type of person involved in , and last , but not the least , from the goal that this person have in mind .

In other word , trying somenthing new do n't implies an automatic success , if this action is not joined with a strong goal , with an hard dedition , and with an important input of motivation related to the scope .

The succes , in other word , do n't depend on how many new are the things that someone could do , but , i think , the most important aspect , is the dedition in what someone are doing .

If somenthing is more close to our character , if rapresent a stimulus , if is challenge , but not impossible to realize , its could be more advantageble to reach success than what a new thing could be .

The successful people , in my opinion , are people that have the capacity to understand what they love , what they are able to do , but not only well , also with passion .
I Think that the true let motive to gain some sucess in our life , is , first of all , the passion that we could have in some field , this is a real advantage agaist our competitor , because , its allow us to do something without fell how it is heavy or hard .
In addition , the passion , is what help , every people to look at some failure , from other point of view , i try to explain how better i can this passage of my discussion , with an example : Successful people , are man and woman that know use its failure , or its error as stimulus to perform better ; they found in a worst situation , like a failure , the most positive thing , and this could turn , a momentaneus failure in a future strong success .

When talk about this , I have in mind , winning people , that could be famouse or not , but that feel realized , and that are happy to do what are doing .
We can think on people involved in sport activity , or in a science enviroment , or in a business contest , but evry one have the same engine inside , the passion , the only thing that could trasform a failure in a future success , the only thing that could help many people to do something special .

The history is full of example of this type of people , from Napoleone to Julio Cesar , from Newton to Eistein ,

Most young people are busy to have fun by themselves or to get ready for their future .

Let me tell you how young people 's mind became evil .

First , young people in Korea love to get drunk .
I saw Korean Times last week , and it said `` More than 77 percents of Korean University students are near alcoholics '' .
I do not think the `` near alcoholics '' have the time to help their communities .

Second , other young people in Korea are really busy to get ready for their future .
They try their best to get all kind of licenses like MBA , GPA .
It is really hard to get a job in Korea nowadays .
That is why young people get ready for their future .

Third , young people hate to help their communities , because they think it is bored and not necceary .
Their parants should tell them to help their communities .
Last , it is really bad for their future if they do not give enough time to help their communities .
It will make them to be phycos .

1817,314118.txt,P5,JPN,medium,"I do n't think that it will decrease the number of cars in just twenty years .
I support my opinion with some reasons I descrive below .

First , Nowadays , cars are one of the most necessary things in our everyday life .
Japanese people sometimes express about cars into `` legs '' in our conversation .
For example , a man says `` We do n't have legs to go to the station. '' , then an another man sais `` We can take a bus . ''
.
First man said `` lags '' , but of course , its not about real legs .
Ordinary people have their legs , so correctly , he wanted to say about a vehicle , but he exchanged the word into legs .
Now , you get an idea how cars are important for us like legs .
We will keep driving cars even in twenty years later .

Secondly , everybody thinks cars are convenient .
We can move far away , and we do n't need to pay for driving without gas or oil fee .
If something new vehicle or machine invented in near future , people might change their way to move , but this invention must be more convenient and cheaper than cars .
In addition to this , this story is not reality , so we should ignore this now .
Cars are too familiar vehicle to throw out , so I think it will nothing to change about cars in future .

In conclusion , cars are very convenient , and necessary for us .

10174,1653892.txt,P8,HIN,medium,"Lets start with the statement `` Successful people are not those whoe different things in the same way , but who belive in doing the same thing but in a DIFFERENT way '' .

I strongly feel and support that without taking any risks in life one cannot expand his horizons .
He will continue thinking and planning things in the same way which make his task less interesting and less challenging and at a point of time it might lead to frustration , for example when someone constantly keeps on typing the same format 100 times a day it becomes boring for him too continue it , instead if he tries out a better font style new colour combination or maybe a better matter to fill up the letter sheets then he is definately trying out something that makes a dull job as writting responce letters , interesting .

The point is that it has taken a lot of risks and experimentations for many successful people to be where they are today .
For example Mr.Donald Trump whom i idealise myself has gone through so much and the people at the Wall street who handle shares they have gone through major heartstopping risks .

One has to make a geniune bold attempt with his ideas if he thinks they are worth and put them to a test , you cannot learn how to swim without getting wet , you have to dive in !

So in conclusion i ll like to add that it takes a lot of heart and courage to try out something new , and nothing can be more depressing than a failure but it is truly said that failures are the stepping stone to success so atleast try its better to learn and gain useful knowledge because that is the true identity of a successful person .

3954,685965.txt,P2,HIN,high,"Well i agree with the statement .
Young poople do actually enjoy life more than older people .
Its important here to define what one mean by `` enjoyment '' .
If one means that enjoyment means having your dream car , more money to spend , going to late naight parties and clubs , then yes youths are indeed at an advantage because they have the youthfull energy and charisma and are not prone to health problems as older people are usually prone to .
But if one defines enjoyment as having peace of mind , relaxation and trouble free life then there cant be happier retired person whose son stays with him and who has all the time in the world to play with his 1 yr old grandson .

Young people have the advantage of flexibility .
They can adapt to a new situation more easily than old people who usually become reserved with age .
If you have to shift from one city to another , as a youth you will be able to adjust very easily to the new city and start enjoying your life but as an oldie you wont be able to come to the terms of the new city and make new friends easily .

The most important factor is of health .
Old age often brings many diseases along with it .
And as one grow old he 's bound to have one or the another disease .
This health factor also contributes a lot to the fact that older people dont enjoy much because even if they are youthful at heart , they cant be physically because their health wont permit .

Science and technology have become internal parts of our life .
Every day there are new gadgets to be found in the nearby store and very quickly they make way into our homes .
Internet has shrinked the world but the its the youth that are making the most use of it .
Todays youth is more technically inclined and he knows how to make the best use of the technolgy that is being discovered and enjoys it to its fullest .
The problem with older people is that they are not that much technically inclined and as a consequence are not inclined towards such gadgets which would make there life more enjoyable .

9194,1466685.txt,P4,FRA,medium,"I am agree with the idea that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

In my opinion , if the advertisement make product more better is in order to encourage people to buy them .
In fact , if the television or the radio make many advertise about one product , the consumers will be more attracted and spend more money .
It is a good way to sell a product because the most important thing consist to attray people .
If the product is very sad or ugly , it is clear that poeple do n't buy it .

For example when we saw advertisement on television about fast food , in particular Mac donald , the burger seems perfect , I mean that he is bigger than the restaurant 's one and seems to have more ingredients but when we go to the restaurant , we have another vision , we have the impression that what we saw at the television is really different than what we have in our plate .
this example shows us that if we did n't see the burger on television , we has n't gone at the Mc'Donalds .

The role of the advertissement is to bring us another way to imagine the product and to push us to buy and to spend money .
All in today 's world is commercial , to spend money is the new way of life and we can see that nowadays that we buy everything even if we do n't need it .

buying give us satisfaction and we could'nt live in this world without selling .
That 's the reason why the medias take the opprtunity to shows us products which seem much better than reality .
Even if we realise that what we are buying is not the same with what the television shows us we will continue to do it because it is necessary .

To conclude , everybody do n't care if the product showed by the advertisement do n't seem like what they really are because the needed is to buy .

10132,1646766.txt,P4,ZHO,medium,"Most advertisemetns make products for many reasons .
They want to sell their products to earn their money and many people have the experience that when you bought something home and realized that are not useful just like what it appeared in a advertisement .
In my opinion , I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better thatn they really are .

The purpose of dvertisements is to make their products to be bought .
They want to sell their products .
Therefore , they need to urge customers to buy .
They will use everything to urge you to buy their products .
Althought it looks not good to eat , advertisements will use the pictures or sounds to let it look like delicious .

Then , advertisements use people 's desire to sell their product .
For example , a advertisement which a hot model hold a diet drink will make many women to buy , because they want to be a hot model .
But , in fact , you ca n't just drink the diet beverage and become the hot model .
Advertisements use that idea to sell their products althought the diet drink are not really working like that way .

Finally , advertisements only show the merit of products .
Advertisers want to sell their products , so they exploit the fallacy of a products .
They only show the good site of their products .
For example , we can see a lot of televsion food advertisements on the television .
they only tell you how delicious they are , but they have never told you that how you really tasted .
They make you see the good parts of products , and you go to buy it , then their goal is achieved .

Because many reasons which they sell their products make the real products are not as the same as they look like in dvertisements .
They can be based on the purpose to sell , the use of your desire , and showing the good part to persuade you to buy their products .
Therefore , i believe that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are .

10975,1798758.txt,P3,KOR,medium,"I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
There are a few reasons that can support my opinion .
First , most people are having lack of time on excessive studying .
The second problem is mass media 's too much attention toward people 's private lives .
I agree with the statement , because of their lack of time , and the bad effects from the mass media .

As the first , people do not give enough time to helping their communities because of the lack of time .
Most young people are really busy nowadays .
Young people who are under nineteen are studying really hard to go good college .
So , they cannot think anything but studying .
The people who graduated college also have difficulies to participate on helping their communities .
Althought they are free from the college , their studying is not finished .
They have to work hard to get a good job , such as lawyer , or work in the big company .
Because of their lack of time , they cannot paticipate on helping their communities .

In addition , the mass media , such as television shows or radio suffer young people to think about nothing , but just themselves .
Nowadays , most television shows are based on people 's private life , that contains a famous movie star 's personal lives or private things .
Through this process , young people who watch televison the most , are attracted to think about their personal and secret lives than the commununities .

There are a few main problems that made young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communitie , .
their lack of time because of studying , and the mass media 's too much attention toward people 's personal lives .

4593,797943.txt,P6,FRA,medium,"This statement points at a very common and recently develloped way of thinking .
Nowadays , people tend to believe that all-included trips led by tour guides are the most inexpensive and pleasant way to travel .
According to my traveling experience as an '' aventurous '' backpacker , I will try to demonstrate in which extense , this unfortunatly too common way of thinking is very far from reality .

First of all , it is common sense that the less intermediates you pass by , the cheaper your trip is going to be .
Consequently , the number 1 rule for a cheap trip is to avoid travel agencies , especially on Internet , which practice abusive fees .
Dealing directly with airlines companies and hotels or hostels will always makes your trip cheaper since , this way you 're not going to have to pay any commision to anyone .
Regarding accomodation , you can reduce your budget to a very low price if you feel like staying in a hostel .
Contrary to what might be thought , many of them are very clean and really cheap .
It also has to be seen as an opportunity to meet , share and talk to foreign travelers from all over the world .
This is , in my opinion , way more enriching than staying with people with whom you share the same culture in regular three stars hotels , since you unescapably have way less to share .
Still in my opinion , the tour schedrule , and the unescapable uninteresting random touristic visits are the main reason why I 'm totaly against all included trips .
If you find yourself in a situation , or a place you do n't like , you 're obliged to handle it , and suffer in silence , waiting for your group to go back to the hotel .
As for the guide , he ' s totally optional since Lonely Planet exists .

3352,581215.txt,P1,JPN,high,"Some people may think that people should specialize in one specific subject because they can write a good thesis .
However , I agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject for the following reasons .

First of all , having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is useful for working .
For example , in 2000 , when I was a forth year student in University of Tokyo , my major was civil engineering .
Of course , I took the subjects about the civil engineering , but I also tool the subjects such as economics and politics .
Now , I work at Japan Central railway company as a engineer and my project is to plan to build the station building .
I need to discuss with many co-workers .
I can solve the problems about this project effectively because I learn about wide knowledge about many subjects .
As a result , this project goes on very well .
This experience shows that having wide knowledge of a lot of academic subjects is very useful for working .

In addition , people can communicate well by having wide knowledge about many academic subjects .
For instance , I join on the swimming club now .
This team is consist of a lot of members such as professors in Keio University , workers at banks and engineers at heavy industrial companies .
In this club , we often go to the bar after the practice of the swimming and exchange some information .
I can communicate effectively with every members because I have wide knowledge of many academic subjects and I can ask some questions to them .
As a result , I can make many friends .
As the above example demonstrates , people can communicate well by having wide knowledge about a lot of academic subjects .

In conclusion , I strongly believe that it is better to have wide knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .

11853,1951565.txt,P8,ITA,high,"On the one hand , risk is something unknown so you can never bet if it 'll turn well or not , but on the other hand , I 'm sure if you do n't take any risk you 'll never be successful .

Although some people think that success is not about risk but just a result of their personal ability , I agree with the statement because different experiences convinced me to that .

First of all , I think about history and all the mathematicians , philosophers , writers ( let 's think about Galileo , Giordano Bruno , Newton and so on ) who often challenged the way of thinking of their age and because of that they almost died poor and alone .
But what 're we still studying in high school or even in a Ph .
D ?
Eventually they were able to carry their ideas through centuries and we would n't ever have their thoughts and teachings if they did n't risk during their life .
They contributed to create our way of thinking so they 're really are among the most successful people ever existed .

Another experience convinces me that risk is an inner quality in successful people .
I 'm talking about all the stories we read on the Internet or books about poor people who decide to change their lifes drastically , maybe starting a new business , or `` playing '' at the Stock Exchange market , and suddendly create an empire ( did n't Bill Gates start in a garage , did he ? )
If there were no risk , nothing would ever been created .
Now thousands of people work thanks to the risk taken by someone in the past , is n't that successful ?

From my point of view , nowadays many people could get wrong on the concept of successful , it 's not just about business and creating money and that 's why I consider successful all the international organization 's members ( and every peace \ maker there ) who everyday challenge incredibly dangerous situations risking their lives in war countries or simply helping children with mortal diseases in Africa .
That 's what really makes a better world .

In conclusion I think that everyone should take his or her own risks , maybe in what they do the best , in order to become successful considering that not any risk is worthy to take

7638,1171832.txt,P1,HIN,medium,"In my opinion an individual should posses sufficient knowledge about his key academic subejcts along with possesing excellent skills in his choice of specific subject .
In this competitive world , one is supposed to have an all rounder personality with a specialization or in other words mastery over that specific subject .
From my experience , an all rounder person will be able to achieve greater success socially and professionally as he 's sound in all of the related areas of his study but at the same time has sufficient knowledge so as not to fall back on any discussion other than his specialization .

To start discussing about my opinion , lets take the situation when one choses to study all of his key subjects without mastering anyone of those .
This practice will result him being vulnerable to loose to each opponent who has at least one of these subjects as his specialization , not ignoring the increased possibility that the individual will be able to participate in any event or conversation pertaining to any of his subject areas .

Another situation to consider will be , when one masters only specific subject without giving considerate attention to his other subjects , will lead him to a situation where he 'll excel in his subject area conversations but at the same time , he 'll not be in a situation to participate in a conversation about any other topic which is not his subject .
In this situation the individual has greater chances of successding in his area of specialization .

We can clearly see that the number of benefits an individual can gain by following either of the two statements will lead to number of disadvantages as well .
As both of the statements has it 's own set of pros and cons , I would disagree with any of these two statements taken alone .
However , combining both of the statements would lead to a much more sensible and pragmatic way of advancing in competitive world .

548,98897.txt,P7,TEL,medium,"Yes , I agree with the following statement because it is more important for the students to understand the ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
It is the class that which will take the student to higher position in the future .

In support to the above words saying that words like to present an example when the student understand the ideas if he understands the class well he can only build the ideas in their own way .
If he understands the subject deeply then only he can able to express his ideas , feelings etc .
For example the student has a science background then he should concentrate on the ideas than on the facts in it because facts about the nature is inefficient it cannot be determined this was the example i described to support the statement .

The student concentrate on the cocepts this he will understand the total theme of the subject if the student is from science department then by taking concepts of small thinks he could make a fabulous think say for example by lowering the concept of sensors he could develop ideas and could automate his by itself .
The main reason for the statement is developing the habit of thinking in own way and give the ideas of his own this will be possible only for the students who understand the ideas and concepts in depth .

The conclusion is by understanding the ideas and concepts that the student will be successfull in his careerand in search of facts the student cannot acheive success in his life .
This is the reason why i should agree the statement that is more important for the student to understand the ideas and concepts .

These are some of the specific reasons and examples i mentioned in this passage to support my answer .

11079,1816302.txt,P7,HIN,medium,"I am agree with this fact that it is very important to undersatnd the idea and concepts .
what you are going to do and what are the options .
If you know the idea it will be lot easier to follow them .

You can follow those consepts .
you can go step by step by following them .
you are studing in college and every day you learn some thing new .
you can learn it only if you understand that .
If you do not understand you can not learn that .
It depends on how smart you are .
If you are very smart you will do it very soon .
If you are not very smart it takes time to learn .
It totaly depends on how fast you understand .
To understand something you want to learn .
You have to pay attention on it .

Even in your normal life you have plan to do something or make a plan for something .
Even for that you have to understand the situation .
how will you manage on time .

In the class if you have to do some assignement first you have to understant that then you can work further .
Facts always come later when you do some thing .
Facts are learned by experinces .
You can not learn it all of a sudden .
Even to learn the facts you have to understand that .

In your regular day when you go to college to attend the class understanding is very important .
If you do not understand what professor is saying what are his concepts .
it is not possible to work on that subject .
it is a kind of impossible to do something that you do not understand .

They main idea of the topic is understand the thing you are doing follow the concepts and you will get the results those are facts .

2942,509700.txt,P1,HIN,high,"Having broad knowledge of many subjects does not lead to a good future .
Whereas specializing in a particular subject in more beneficial nowadays .
I completely disagree to the statement that `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many acedemic subjets than to specialise in one specific subject . ''

Nowadays there is demand for professinals , who know their job very well and can handle any task in a particular field .
People who have broad knowledge about many academic subjects , do not actually know what field they really want to master in and so they have knowledge about many subjects .
It is very well said `` A jack of all trades is a master of none . ''
So this implies that to be a master or to actually achieve what you desire you need to be pragmatic and should know what is neccesary for you to achieve what you desier for yourself .

I have even seen many people who have degrees in many fields but still do not have what they want for themselves .
For example , one of my friend 's elder brother has many degrees in different field and has alot of knowedge about many different academic subject , but he still does not have an aim or a particular direction to move in .
Whereas one of my cousins had a masters degree in computers , which was his favorite subject from his school days and then got a proper job with proper status and a respectful social life .

It is not bad to have vast knowledge , but having vast vast knowledge in many different fields , stops you from being interested in a particular field .
It is not only that having vast knowledge is important What is more important is to be more smarter and choos a specific field to major in .

Thus i would say that specialising in a particular subject is more beneficial than having fast knowledge of various subjects .
As , now you are wanted to be more knowledgeable about your subject , then it does not matter how much you know about other subjects .

8155,1267936.txt,P7,KOR,medium,"I agree withe the statement that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts .
For three reasons .

The first reason why I agree is understanding ideas and concepts is more important than just learning the facts is according to my experience .
When I was 10th grade I hated math that is because I am not good at math .
I just memorized the facts but I did not know why the answer is .
But , when I was 11th grade , my math teacher said that I have to know the ideas and concepts to do well in the math .
From then , I did not memorized the facts , instead , I studied the ideas and concept .
After the few month , I became to do well in math .
According to my experience , I think understanding ideas and concepts is more important .

Second , to understand ideas and concepts we have to think long , patiently .
During this process we can learn the facts automatically and we will not forget the facts .
And during the process , to understand ideas and concepts , it will make us to think more flexibly .
And make us more logically .

And the last as we understand ideas and concepts we can understand the facts more .

Beacuse , understanding ideas and concepts may make us to think more flexibly and more logically , may we make us tounderstand the facts more and according to my experience I agree with the statement that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts .

2366,409820.txt,P3,ARA,medium,"People at the past do whatever they can to help their community .
Nowadays people are different in their actions , in their traditions , and as well as in their thinking .
Young people give a small amount of time helping thier country for having more things to distract them like advantege of the technology , working outside the country to get more money , and having a bad family .

The first aspect that distract young people is the technology that led them to sit in their houses and do every thing they want .
For instance , they can make a bussiness by using the internet for their own benefit .
Another example is the new video games which make these young people playing it with other people by the internet .

The second resone is that their community doese no offer to tham a good salary , so they go to other communities to work for .
Moreover , their community does n't offer an execellant working conditions .

Having a bad family will surely not let the young people to do anything to thier community .
They are already do n't like their society , so they will do just the horrible things like crimes and they will leave the good things .

Finally , a good society will have a good young peopleto help it .
We must solve these reasons , so we can get

7296,1141167.txt,P8,JPN,medium,"Taking risks to be more successful or keeping the current success level not to fall down , not changing their business style is crutial questions to business leaders .
I strongly agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .

First of all , in a business world , self-achievement is considered the most effecitve faactors to motivate wokers .
Setting their own goal by themselves , planning to achieve the goal , and assess their achievement by themselves is done by the workers .
If the assessment is enough for the boss to approve , the workers can promote .
In the world famous car company TOYOTA , this system works well .
It will cultivate workers ' enegy toward their working and produce a lot of suceessful people .

Second , being creative the key to success .
Sometimes cocnservative people want to keep the current style , especially if their business is going well .
Howver , the time and the world are changing .
Today 's novelty is not attracitve next year in some business foield .
Being brave to make a decision to create a new plan based on analytical thought and precise reserach of the market will lead to the real success .
When these theory is accepted , workers have no doubt to be successful themselves .

Third , cooperation is also key to be successful .
If the company keep the current business , everyboday can do his job individually .
However , once the company decides to challenge a new project , relationship in a team is the essential .
Cooeration is necessary .

As I mentioned above , in either as the individual or the company , trying a new things amd taing risks will challengin and bring some effect .
I agree only people who are brave to challenge can be successful .
