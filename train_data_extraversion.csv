"I would feel very awkward because I do not know the people with whom I am supposed to be interacting. Even though I was very nervous on the inside, I would go to any refreshments table. Hopefully, someone there will say something that would spark a conversation. I would try to ease into conversation with others while I waited for my friend. If there was no spark of conversation, I would hang back in the room until my friend came. I would probably not be very happy with this friend, especially if they were more than a couple minutes late.",2.333333333
I would be extremely uncomfortable and upset with my friend for not making sure they were at the party before me so I knew someone else there. I would probably find something to drink so it felt like I was keeping myself busy and then I'd slowly wander around the area acting like I was looking for someone. I might also find a spot to sit and get on my phone so it looked like I was busy and not lonely. I would feel embarrassed by other people thinking that I didn't have any friends and I'd do what I could to avoid interacting with others until my friend arrived.,2.583333333
"I would feel a bit afraid since I'm not comfortable being in a crowd of people I don't know too well. However, I'm also relatively good at making friends, so I would try to see if I can reach out to other people at the party to see if they want to talk and become friends. I would also check out the other activities at the party so that when my friend arrives, I can tell them about what I think are the best parts of the party, so that we can enjoy them together. I would definitely check out the food at the party and ask other guests what they think tastes the best, since I'm a foodie and I'm sure my friend would be, too.",2.833333333
"I would be a bit annoyed at my friend being late, but realize these things happen. I would feel a little nervous around people I didn't know, but I would do my best to just mingle and wait patiently for my friend to get there. I would maybe introduce myself to the host so he knows I'm supposed to be there. Otherwise I wouldn't do much of anything until I was comfortable with the situation. That is what I would do in this kind of scenario, as I am not much of a people person. I can't imagine I would do anything else in this particular situation.",2.166666667
"I would be annoyed that they had invited me to this party where they knew that I was the only person that I know and I would think that it was rude of them to be late. I would most likely wait in my car for them to arrive and I would text them and tell them that I was waiting on them. I think that I would most likely play a game on my phone while I waited for them, I would only wait about 15 to 20 minutes for them to arrive though. If they were going to be later than that I would just go home.",3.416666667
"I would feel very uncomfortable if I arrived at the party early and my friend was not there. I would probably wait in my car and play with my phone until my friend arrived. If I did not have a car with me, I would find a place to sit and wait for my friend. While waiting I would probably introduce myself to the host so that they knew who I was and let the host know that my friend was running late but she is coming. I would feel uncomfortable introducing myself, but I would also feel obligated to do so.",1.583333333
"I would feel highly anxious about my friend being late and wonder if he's going to actually show up. I would first text him to see if he's on the way and to get an estimate of how much longer I should expect to wait. Depending on his answer, I might decide to mingle with some of the other people in the party and see if I can join in on a conversation. I would also go and grab a drink or two to take some of the edge off. If he ends up being very late or not showing up, I would try to make the best of being at the party on my own and try to make friends with someone there. If it ends up being too uncomfortable, I might excuse myself and go home early.",2.416666667
"I'd be anxious and feel uncomfortable. The first thing I would do is start looking for the snack area and alcohol. Alcohol helps ease my anxiety and so I can loosen up a bit. Social settings tend to be anxiety inducing for me. I've been in situations like these before. Eventually, I end up having quite a bit of fun. Sometimes, my mind just play these scenarios and make up bad things. That is just anxiety for you. I'd make sure that I will have a good time with or without my friend. Plus, I'm certain by the end of the night, I have made some new mates myself.",3
"When I get there, I would definitely be a bit nervous and feel some anxiety because I don't know anyone there. The first thing I would do is wait outside for my friend and text him. I would ask him how long until he arrives. Then I would most likely just go to the party alone first. I would try to get an alcoholic drink so I can loosen up. After that, I would find the host and introduce myself and tell him how my friend is late. When that is done, I would probably find some people and introduce myself to them as well. I would just make the most of the time until my friend arrives.",4.5
"I really don't mind being around people I've never met before, so I wouldn't be very uncomfortable waiting for my friend. I know how important this party is to him or her, so I would do whatever I had to do to make it a successful night for my friend. I would probably introduce myself to some people while I waited for my friend. I think it might help my friend relax when he gets to the party if he sees me having fun and getting to know some of the guest. I hope he or she would be able to join in on the conversations that I have started.",4.583333333
I would feel mad at my friend because I am coming to this party and expecting them to be there. Since I do not know anyone else there it would be awkward for me to try to find people to talk to and I think it is rude of my friend. I would discuss with them when I saw them how this makes me feel and I would not go to a party with my friend again because of this. I would consider how much I want to keep them as a friend because of why they did this to me. I would try my best to enjoy the party while they are on the way to the event.,3.333333333
"I would call them a few times and see if they are still on for the night and if we are still going to party, I need to know whether or not I'm wasting my time and if I'm going to go out with them or not. Because them running late would make me feel bad and make me feel like they just kind of stood up the entire situation and made something worse when I expected more from them. I would at least hope to know something, but in the meantime, I would talk to other people and try to get my name out there and just feel more comfortable in that situation, so I think I'd really just be buying time until my friend decided to show up or tell me they cannot make it, whatever the situation I would do what I can to make the most of it.",2.916666667
"I would feel good and not too worried that my friend was late. In the mean time I would check out the scenery and greet people and introduce myself. I would strike up a convo with someone so I could pass the time while waiting for my friend to arrive at this party that he invited me to tonight. I would probably have a drink and some snacks, if they were offered and would just be patient and friendly and comfy until the arrival of my late friend. I think it would be ok to be a little late to the part.",4.25
I would feel a little nervous and would want to wait as late as I can to go in. I would then go I and grab a drink and just find a corner where I can kind of hide until my friend gets there. I can look busy and look on my phone and really find anything to keep my mind and attention to until my friend finally shows up. I would give it a 20 minute or so wait until I might think about leaving that party and going home or somewhere else. I know my friend might be mad if I did that but I would feel pretty uncomfortable anyway.,4
"I would probably go straight to the fridge and grab a drink. I would text or call my friend to see where he or she is at. I would look around the party to see if there are people dressed in a certain way that matches my style. I would also look around to see if people are talking about anything I may know about. If I notice someone may have a similar interest or hobby as me, I would walk over, introduce myself, and ask them a question. If they seemed friendly I would continue talking to them until my friend arrives. I would really hate standing alone in the corner.",2.416666667
"It would be highly annoying that he is late, but will introduce myself and make small talk with other guests. Will probably just have one drink and if he still doesn't arrive will bail out. It is not really any fun to be at a party where you do not know anyone. It is a small world, though, so the odds of finding someone on common ground would be pretty good. Different people will react differently. Some will make a lot of small talk and try to enjoy themselves, while others will bail as soon as possible without trying to appear rude.",2.916666667
"I would feel incredibly awkward and uncomfortable. I'd see my friend as my security blanket and without them being there, I would not just waltz in and start conversing. If I'm in my car and notice they aren't there yet, I'm probably going to just awkwardly sit in my car and text or call my friend to see what the situation might be. If I've walked to a place with other people and there's no sign of my friend, I'm going to give them a call to find out where they may be located and when they may arrive. From there, I'll just have to wait it out.",2.166666667
"I would be okay. I do well at parties and events where I am there alone and don't know anybody else. As long as the party is fun and the people there are cool then I would do just fine. Of course I would get a hold of my friend and let them know I am there and see when they will be arriving. But other than that it would be okay, if anybody says anything I will just say I came with my friend but he or she hasn't arrived yet. No big deal overall! I just find it really easy to talk to strangers and make new friends, I do it all the time.",5
I would be aggravated with my friend since she is the one who was invited and she knows the host. I would prefer to wait in my car until they arrived but I wouldn't be opposed to going on inside. I would be a little embarrassed but would go ahead and enter. Then I would mingle with the guests and meet new people as if I actually belonged. It is already and awkward situation so I don't think I could make it much worse. I would start at the beverage and snack area to find someone to converse with so I didn't seem so alone.,4.166666667
I would wait for my friend in the car or not inside the house. I would probably text her a lot and ask her why she is late and what she is doing that is taking forever. I would feel very anxious and would tell her that I was going to leave if she did not come quick. I would over think everything and think she didn't really want to see me if she could not be on time. I would consider leaving if she took to long because I would be so anxious and upset. I would probably fix my makeup in the car or try to do something to keep my mind of the situation and how I was feeling.,2.166666667
I wouldn't mind. I would try to find the host and introduce myself especially if there is a way I can find them. Most of the parties with large crowds are pretty easy to blend in anyway. I would text or call my friend that I am inside and see what the vibe of the party is. More than likely I would see if there are any games going on that I might want to join in on or go grab some food and introduce myself to some people. I don't find that all so overwhelming to be honest. I think a lot of people would get impatient. If my friend didn't respond or show up and I wasn't enjoying myself I would leave after about an hour or so.,3.666666667
"I am a socially anxious person and I do not like parties, so I wouldn't be feeling good about going to this party in the first place. I would be annoyed with my friend for being late, because I definitely don't want to go in there without knowing anyone to talk to. The thought of trying to approach strangers to talk to them makes me very anxious. I would try to find a quiet spot to hang out and wait for my friend to arrive. I would probably get my phone out and browse stuff on reddit while I wait.",1
"I would definitely feel awkward not knowing anyone. But I would remind myself that some of these people did know my friend. So that would be a great conversation starter. I could just walk up to random people and ask them if they were familiar with my friend. Then I would tell them the story about how I ended up at a party where I knew no one because my friend who knew them was late! Hopefully my friend would arrive shortly after and she or he could introduce me to the hosts and other guests. Generally speaking I feel that when I am in a situation where I know no one, that is a good opportunity to meet new people. Hopefully I would fit in and have a great time!",3.5
"If I showed up to a party in which I knew no one and my friend showed up late, I would be pissed. There is nothing I hate more than when people take advantage of me or don't think my time is worth anything. The fact that I arrived at the party and my friend couldn't even call to tell me they were running late would make me want to leave. I suppose I would sit in my car for a few minutes while I texted or called my friend. If I didn't hear from them in 10 minutes or so, I would text them to tell them I am going home.",1.5
"I would be upset with my friend, but things happen that are often out of our control. I would do my best to socialize with other people, and try to find the host of the party to tell them that I appreciate them inviting me to the party. Eventually, when my friend did arrive, I could joke about how they abandoned me here all alone with my newly formed friends, and we could all get a laugh at the whole situation, make the night a little easier. I of course wouldn't really be all that mad at my friend, but it would be nice to make light of the situation.",3.166666667
"I would definitely feel awkward in a situation like this. I would text or call my friend and ask how much longer they would be so I could gage how much longer I would be waiting. It would be one thing if I knew the host or even a few people at the party, but I would know no one and it could lead to awkward conversations. If my friend did not respond to me I would most likely end up sitting in the car and waiting for them or stop off somewhere to kill some time until my friend arrived.",3.083333333
"I would absolutely feel irritated. I am not good with people I don't know. I am pretty good if I am around people I know, but I am not comfortable with new people. I would probably be pretty mad at my friend for not arriving on time. I would probably call and text my friend incessantly until my friend gave me an answer. I would possibly drive off to go and do something else until my friend got back to me. I am not likely to go into the party early because I can be very weird around people I do not know.",1.833333333
I would feel annoyed that my friend is late knowing that I have not met these people before. My friend would know that I am not a very social person and that I am not very comfortable around strangers. I would try my best to make conversation with some of the people there. I would look for someone that I would think that I would have things in common with based on first sight. I would likely retreat to somewhere that gives me some space to help me feel more comfortable. I would probably text or call my friend to try to hurry them up and see what time they would get here.,1.166666667
"I would feel really uncomfortable, especially because I do not know anyone besides my friend. I am really awkward in these kinds of situations, so I would have asked before hand if we could drive there together. Since I am alone and don't know anyone, I would wait outside for my friend, or call her and have her talk to me until she gets there. If she doesn't answer, I could play on my phone. If I wait there for a long period of time and she doesn't show, I would just leave. This is no longer fun for me. If I was feeling confident, I might look for someone else who is lonely or by themselves and try to talk to them. Or look for an animal I can pet to keep me company.",2.583333333
I'd feel a bit irritated with my friend and I'd message them immediately to get a realistic estimate of when they were going to arrive. I'd feel awkward and uncomfortable since I didn't really know anyone and I didn't have my own reason to be there. I'd want to leave but I'd stay until my friend arrived provided they weren't going to be more than half an hour late. If they were going to be any longer I'd tell them I wasn't comfortable there and I'd leave. If I was staying I'd quietly observe the party for a while until my friend got there.,4
"This has happened to me. I walked into a person kitchen I did not know and did not see my friend. I felt all the noise around me, I saw the faces that I didn't recognize. I panicked and walked back home. I later sent them a text apologizing that I wasn't there, and that I would catch up with them later. All I could think about was the people might say and expect of me. I had no way of knowing what their social norms were and if they pick up on that I was an outsider. I felt a lot better at home and stayed there.",1.916666667
"It is really difficult to go to a party, or any place in general, alone and try to socialize because it takes a lot of effort but it is achievable. The good thing about going alone when nobody knows is that you can behave in whatever way you want because nobody knows you. Be really social, probably a little flirty. Don't be the guy or girl who is just looking at his or her phone all night. I introduced myself, smile, keep my head up, talk, and have fun. I introduce myself in the beginning, I was interested in what somebody has to say and ask questions while sometimes giving personal stories about the subject or whatever. In the beginning this can be a struggle, look at somebody's body language to find out how they find the conversation.",3.583333333
"I would at first look around the party and double check to make sure that they aren't already there. I would ask around to people if they have seen my friend. I would feel somewhat upset that they were late, but I would understand that it may have been due to circumstances outside of their control and I would reserve my judgement for when I find out what the reason is. I would try and call and text my friend to see if they would respond and tell me where they are and if they are still coming. While I waited I would walk around the party and talk to people and get to know them and what's been happening at the party.",3.083333333
"that would be okay I think, I'd plan to go in and just introduce myself, being totally curious about the situation, explain that my friend was late. Given the description I have no idea what to expect, so in reality depending on the house, the people I spotted, their dress and style and stuff, this might turn out to be a lot harder than I think, but that's what I imagine I'd do. If I felt intimidated for whatever reason I might be inclined to just sit in the car and wait for my friend, feeling too much pressure to just walk in alone, maybe that would be weird now that I think about it. Again it depends largely on the situation.",3.333333333
"I would feel really scared and really anxious, and probably leave early. Why did I go to the party alone and not go to my friend's first? Knowing I hate parties in the first place, why would I risk being alone with people I do not know? I don't know, but I am very nervous around people that I do not know and will just probably find a corner where I can sit and be invisible for the time being, if I couldn't leave myself. I will have this anxious feeling in my stomach and I feel like I will have a panic attack, and it will just consume me.",1.083333333
"I would arrive and wait for my friend. I know that they are running late, but I would keep my attitude positive and scope out the scene. I would feel a bit upset just because they knew that I didn't know anyone and I wasn't very familiar with the crowd of people around at this party. I would grab a drink for myself while I wait. I casually mingle with others and say a quick hello to those who pass by. Perhaps, someone will stop to have a quick conversation. I would try to make the best of the situation that I am in and hope that my friend arrives sooner rather than later.",3.916666667
I would be extremely nervous arriving at ta party where I know no one. I would call my friend immediately to find out where they were. I would try to look like I fit in while there. I may go tot he bathroom and spend a long time there to waste a bit of time. I may walk around and get a drink or something to eat. I would avoid people because I would have too much anxiety to spark up a conversation with a stranger. I would try to stay in the background the best I could until my friend arrived.,1.166666667
"I would feel dumb and lost because I know nobody at the party. If I can find someone besides the host to talk to, I would talk to those people until my friend arrived. If I couldn't find anyone I know I would call my friend and check if they will be there soon. If it's a long delay, I might leave and come back when my friend gets there. If it turns out that I don't know anyone at the party and my friend will not be there for a very long time I would probably leave and go home. It would be too awkward to stay.",3.583333333
"I would feel very awkward and out of place not knowing anyone there. If I could go outside without it being obvious, I'd probably go back out and wait for my friend where I think they'll arrive. If I think it would look weird if I went back outside, then I'd probably try to find where the food and drinks were and head over there. At least with a glass in my hand I probably wouldn't feel as awkward. I might try to find a larger group of people that I could just hang on the edge without having to really engage with anyone.",2.416666667
"I would feel a little irritated that my friend was late, but yet I actually expected it. I would introduce myself to the host and explain to them that I was invited by my friend who is habitually late. After making my introduction, I would try to mingle in the group by introducing myself and asking about the other attendees. Trying to get a feel for the group as I mingle and talk with a variety of people. When my friend finally shows up, I welcome her and offer her some of the refreshments that she had missed by being late. We then mixed with the group of guests and made small talk. I was very interesting and I hopefully made a few new friends from the group. I didn't really feel very uncomfortable, but would have preferred that my friend had been on time. But, all in all, I probably made more new acquaintances by her being late and me just mingling in the group.",4.333333333
"I would feel so awkward. I'm not good around strangers, especially when I don't have a friend or somebody I know to lean on. I don't know how to start conversations very well. Unless somebody approached me and started talking to me, I would probably just pretend to mingle and have a few drinks until my friend for there so I could waste some time. If they ended up being extremely late, I would likely leave so I didn't look weird just standing there not talking to anyone. I could only buy up so much time before people would start noticing how awkward I actually am, and it would become embarrassing.",2.75
"In this scenario, I would feel very, very uncomfortable. I am not very good at being outgoing and meeting new people. I would try to find someone I knew slightly and talk to them. I would focus on any children or pets. I tend to bond with children easily cause they appreciate adults that are willing to be silly or play games. If it were possible at all, I would text my friend when I first got there and ask if she was there yet. If not, I would consider waiting in my car. If I had to go into the party, I could try to find the host and introduce myself and talk to the host about my friend and how we all know each other.",1.833333333
I would look around to see if anyone there was someone I knew and if not I would look for someone who looked interested in meeting someone new. I would pick this person out and go over and introduce myself to them. I would then ask if they knew my friend who was late coming to the party. I would then probably ask them what they do for a living. Then if they seemed interested in what I did I would tell them what I did for a living. We could then go into a discussion about the food that the party was serving and what we thought about it. Hopefully by this time it wouldn't matter if my friend shows up or now because I have met someone new.,4.166666667
"I am usually not too shy of a person these days. I used to be when I was growing up, however no longer. So, I would probably try and connect with the host if they weren't that busy. This way I am sure they would introduce me to others at the party, If they are busy I would probably introduce myself on my own. I think I could feel out the situation and get a pretty good feel of whether we have things in common or not. I would probably stick away from topics such as politics or religion and instead talk about music, movies, or even sports. I think overall I could handle myself fine. If not however, if they seem awkward, I would possibly run out and get some food or run an errand until my friend were free. I don't see this as likely however.",4.833333333
"I'd do what I do in any social situation- be it a bar, a party, a gathering, etc. You eavesdrop on a conversation and then slide in with an opinion with a group that looks socially welcoming. Then gradually introduce yourself, explain why you are there, and then they typically will introduce you to other people. You can then be introduced to the host, the circle of people, and then others as well as they come in and out of that social circle. It just makes things a lot easier that way. Or you can stand by the food are and ask people questions about the food then introduce yourself to them.",4
"I would feel anxious and a bit out place, as most likely I would be in the foyer or the entry way of the venue waiting for my friends arrival. I would feel a bit irritated as I am doing this favor and ensuring I am doing my part. My friend would know how I feel about punctuality so I am sure she has a good reason. None the less, each second that passes by will feel like years. I would feel extremely self-conscience as I would think everyone is looking at me as the awkward girl who no one seems to know. I would regret accepting but feel a lot better once she shows up.",3.75
"At first, I would feel uncomfortable with the fact that my friend was late, but then I would start mingling around attempting to get to know other party goers. I would grab a few drinks to loosen myself up. I would attempt to find the host and introduce myself and thank them for hosting such a nice party. I would attempt to crack a few jokes at my friend's expense, talking about how late he was, since most of them probably know him. My overall goal would be to make myself feel as welcomed as possible by getting to know as many people as I could.",3.916666667
"I would feel very awkward in front of people that I didn't know, especially because I was not invited by any of the people currently at the party. I would likely had to get a drink and look for someone else who is standing alone in order to start a conversation. That way I wouldn't look so weird being by myself. If I couldn't find someone else standing alone I would likely start texting on my phone or maybe scrolling through social media, Again to help with having any attention drawn to myself. I would likely do this until my friend got to the party, but I would be very stressed out and may even become slightly upset with my friend.",2.583333333
"I would feel terribly awkward and moderately irritated with my friend. If socially appropriate I would grab a drink and then try to find a semi-isolated or quiet space to text the friend, asking how long until they got there. I would try to look busy on my phone afterwards, like I was in an important conversation or doing something for work. If my friend responded quickly, and was relatively close by, I would probably relax a bit and see if I knew anyone that I could walk up to and say hi or check out their response to my joining them or their group. If the friend didn't respond or was going to be very late 30 mins or more I would consider just leaving. I would probably give them 30 minutes max before I just left.",1.333333333
"I am not very good at being in places where I don't know anyone, especially a party situation. I would probably go over to where they were serving food and drinks and grab something in order to busy myself until my friend arrived. I would sit at a small table or somewhere off to the side and out of the way. If my friend still wasn't there at this point then I would get out my smartphone and message him to see where he was and when he was getting there. If he was going to be very late, I might leave.",2.416666667
"If I wasn't very familiar with the host and it was a party at their house, I would bring a thank you gift, such as a bottle of wine, and give it to the host. I would let them know that our mutual friend had invited me and that he was running late. I would grab a drink, scan the crowd, and try and find someone I could strike up a conversation with. If everyone else seemed too busy, I would more than likely, pull out my phone and check emails and social media for a few minutes until either my friend arrived or I find someone else to strike up a conversation with.",4.25
"I would feel kind of irked that my friend dragged me to this gathering and then he has not even made the effort to be there when he said he would. I wouldn't get all upset though. I'd just give him a quick call to see if he's still coming, then I'd find the food and the booze and go ahead and try to just mingle and enjoy myself since I'm there and not leaving anytime soon. I might scan the crowd for any other people who seem to be by themselves and go strike up some chit chat with them until my friend arrives.",3.666666667
I would feel very awkward and would attempt to make small talk with the person that is the owner at the house. I would also probably call my friend to figure out where they are at before I go to the house to se if they are just a couple minutes away. If my friend was too far away I may just leave and come back later when they are there so that I do not have to have too long of an awkward interaction with the other person that I do not know. I think that I would rather avoid the awkward social interactions as much as I could.,2.75
"In real life, I would not go to a party like this. I do not like parties. I do not like being around drunk people because it is embarrassing- for them, not me. And I find these are terrible situations to get to know new people. But if by some chance my friend coerced me into going, I'd give him five minutes and then I'd leave. Dude should have shown up on time. I'm not there for me. I'm there for them. And if they don't show, then why am I there? Obviously, as previously stated, parties are not my bag. Not point in me waiting for someone that does not respect what I am doing for them.",1.083333333
"I would feel indifferent. I would probably start by walking around the whole party and see what was going on. See what type of food, drinks, or entertainment was at said party. If the party was really fancy or something I would probably not go up trying to talk to random people however, if it was not a fancy party I would not hesitate to try to meet new people. After talking to people if my friend still had not showed up I would probably just start messing around on my phone. When my friend arrives I would introduce him or her to the people I met.",3.416666667
"I would feel slightly nervous and annoyed. I would sit and wait in the car for my friend to get there. I would say a few prayers and take some deep breaths. I would ask my friend what time she expects to get there and tell her that I will wait outside for her. I will sit in the car on my phone and listen to music as I continue to wait. I would feel only partly annoyed and irritated and I would have thoughts of just leaving and bailing and going home, but I would not do so. I would also be a little tired waiting on her. I may close my eyes to take a short nap or just give my eyes a rest.",2.916666667
"Honestly, I'm extremely shy even in social situations and parties where I know a few people in my own right, so I would more than likely try my hardest to get away to somewhere private and just kind of wait until my friend arrived- the bathroom or the backyard if it was daytime or the weather was nice. I would try to be inconspicuous and play around on my phone or something until my friend arrived. I don't think I would be able to go up to random people and start conversations without my friend being there. I'm just too introverted.",2.666666667
"I would be a little miffed that my friend was late, after all, this was their idea. I would not go in to the party, I would wait in my car and try calling or testing my friend to see where they were at. If security or any one noticed me and came over I would just let them know that I was waiting for my friend so we could go in to the party together. If sitting in the parking lot was not acceptable I would leave. If my friend cannot be on time for their own event then they don't value my time and I would go and do something that I wanted to do.",1
I would initially feel apprehensive and uneasy being around so many people that I don't know. I would probably try to introduce myself to one person and talk with them while waiting for my friend to arrive at the party. I would try to find common ground with the person that I am talking with and hopefully other people will join the group so I can introduce myself to them. If not then I hope the conversation I have with the one person will last until my friend arrives. I would also try calling my friend to see when he will arrive at the party.,5
"Just showed up to the party and realize that my friend hasn't arrived yet. As I look around at the party attendants, I try to gauge how the feeling or mood of the event is. I see a table loaded with snacks and drinks and make my way over to the table. There are other people meandering around the table, so I start up a conversation with one of the ladies. As we're talking, my friend shows up. I introduce him to the woman and it turns out she was his old kindergarten teacher. I reflect back on the few minutes I was there and am glad to have a few minutes to scope out the area, get some food and feel the mood before committing to my friend that night.",3.916666667
"First of all I would definitely feel pretty annoyed with my friend for being late and leaving me in this situation. I would feel socially awkward and anxious being surrounded by all these people that I don't know, especially because I would have been counting on my friend to introduce me to them. I would keep to myself unless somebody else struck up conversation with me, in which case I'd be as friendly as possible and introduce myself. While waiting for my friend I would have a few alcoholic drinks in order to loosen up and be a little more open to socializing.",1.25
"I would feel anxiety. I do not do well is social situations to begin with, so also not knowing anyone, I would be slightly panicked and a little pissed, honestly. I would try and contact the friend immediately to see where she or he is at. Maybe they are running late, or not showing at all. If they were just late I would make the best of it and try to find someone approachable to talk to, waste time until my friend gets there. If they were not able to make it, I would leave. My personality is not likely to stay in that situation.",2.333333333
"Uninviting someone is one of the rudest things you can do to someone. There is no way you can do it politely so don't do it. They will never think of you the same. So, if they matter to you in any way do not tell them not to come. Put yourself in their place and you will understand how it feels. If you invite them by mistake then change your accommodations to account for them. Do not punish them because you screwed up, or have what you think is a better choice. The only way it can be justified is if there are ticket matters with the event that make it impossible for them to attend. If that's the case, be honest with them about it.",2.75
"I would feel a bit awkward in the situation as I have not been formally invited to the function. However, as I do know the person that has been invited I would begin to mingle about. I would first go to the bar and get a drink to loosen up a bit. A bit of food would be nice as I am sure that I would be hungry at that point, so I would look to find the food table or some appetizer trays set about in the party and get something to eat. I would then start looking for someone to talk to. This would be a great chance to meet some new people.",1.666666667
Being in a big crowd is really scary for me because I do not like going out and socializing. So going to this party is really difficult for me and makes me anxious. Seeing my friend is late makes me feel nervous and anxious with these people since I do not know them. I am out of my comfort zone and I feel like an outcast. I will probably wait somewhere outside where there is no people around and wait for my friend for a few minutes. If she did not come then I would go home and just call her to tell her that I cannot wait for her long.,3.166666667
"First, I would look around the room just to be sure I don't recognize anyone. If I don't recognize anyone, I would probably sit back and observe who the host is. Once I identify the host, I would go over and introduce my self and tell the host our mutual friend is on the way. I would start small talk with the host. If the host introduces me to other people at the party, then I could start up a conversation with them and talk until my friend arrives. If the host doesn't introduce me to their friends, I would probably look for the biggest group of people who are talking among each other and walk over to that group. I would try to jump into the conversation. I would feel a bit nervous, but I know how to handle myself in conversations.",3.916666667
"I would be a little irritated with my friend for starters. If the party was important, and I am important as a friend, there are already two good reasons to show up on-time and to keep one's commitments. I would also feel unimportant in the fact that making a 9 pm party is very far outside my normal time for socializing I'm usually getting in to bed at this time which would further compound my frustration with my friend. All that being said, if it's not a party I know directly I would probably hang out outside or in my car, and try to get a hold of my friend to see what might have kept them from being there on-time and to find out a new ETA.",3.083333333
"I would feel very awkward and kind of annoyed. Depending on my mood, I might either stick to the background and hope avoid drawing attention to myself while I wait for my friend to arrive, or I might take command of the situation and approach the host directly and introduce myself. If there was a bar available, I might also head that way and buy something to drink, and maybe talk with others who are doing the same. I might also linger in the crowd, listen in to other conversation, and try to familiarize myself with the types of people I'm with.",2.5
"I would most likely feel very awkward and uncomfortable. I would probably keep to the sides of the room out of everyone's way. I would respond to anyone who strikes up a conversation with me in a friendly manner. Depending on how late my friend was I would consider giving them a call to see how much longer they will be. For the most part I would remain quiet and unassuming, probably spending a lot of time admiring any works of art in the room and trying to remain inconspicuous. I would feel extremely relieved once my friend finally shows up.",1.166666667
"I guess I would feel ok, I usually stay relaxed in that kind of situations. I would probably just go to the bar, ask for a whiskey to help me relax a little bit more, check out the girls in the room, listen to some music, probably do some chit chat with someone while waiting for my friend. Who knows, I might even pick up a chick on the party and next time my friend will for sure not be late as he or she will be left alone. But that surely isn't a situation that would affect me in anyway.",3.25
"I think I'd feel a little anxious even though I know how to handle social situations pretty easily. After feeling nervous for a little bit, I'd find someone at the party who I could identify with and speak to. I'd kind of stick with them, and introduce myself and ask them to help me make some introductions at the party. I'd do my very best to fit in with people there, and not be too much of an outsider. I'd be angry with my friend for putting me in this situation unless they had a very good reason for being late. But overall, I'd still mingle and do my best to impress.",5
Because the fact they are late is not an un common occurrence as it is rather normal for most people to be late to things as the world is an ever revolving door of events and such it is not something we can and will always be able to say with one hundred percent surety that we can will always be and never will be late to events as it can and will happen to the best of us through out life and sometimes it can be bad I would feel understanding and just patiently wait it out for them to finally arrive.,4.666666667
"I would feel mildly annoyed, but I would try to start talking to people and see who is there and if I know anybody. I would probably text or call my friend to see where they are and when they think they will get there. But mostly I would try to start mingling with people and maybe get a drink or something to eat if there was anything available at the party. I would focus on that and on having fun and enjoying myself and less on where my friend was. I would try to find people my friend knows as well to start talking to people. I might stay near the entrance of the party so that I could see my friend when they arrive, or I would text my friend where I am in the party so that they could find me when they get there.",3.5
"This is one of my worst nightmares. I would likely be completely panicked and I would begin to furiously text my friend demanding to know where they were and the exact minute that they plan to arrive at the party. In the meantime, I might scan the room for a familiar face but, probably more likely, I would sneak back outside and wait for my friend at the corner. I would feel full of anxiety and the back of my neck would be hot. If I couldn't find an escape route then I would likely find a corner and pull out my phone and pretend to text or read some news story or something -- to ensure that no one would think to talk to me.",1.916666667
I would most likely sit in my car until my friend arrived. I would park further away so no one can see me in my car. I would listen to music and text my friend for updates every so often. I would make sure there is room next to me so my friend can park. I would not want to go inside as I do not know anyone and wouldn't even know what to do. I may end up even going to the wrong house. Since the host does not know me they probably will not let me in and think I am intruder. It can be really bad if I went in all by myself.,5
I would ask my friend why they are late. Hopefully they have a good explanation for me. This will Determine to see if they have a good excuse of what they have done. Hopefully it is a minor thing and things can be worked out on the spot. I have a habit of always being early so someone being late does bother me a little bit. I do forgive people for being late when it does not happen on a regular basis. This makes things very hard for me when people do not want To treat me in a proper way. It can definitely be hard at times.,4.333333333
"Honestly I would arrive early because I hate being late. I would sit in my car for a minute or two, check my phone, and then suck it up, grab my things, and walk to the door. After knocking, I would introduce myself to the host and let them know who invited me. I'd go inside, make small talk and genuinely try and break the ice. I don't need to wait for my friend in order to make connections and have a good time- I rather have them get to know me personally anyways, not just be seen as the friend.",4.333333333
"I would be upset because I'd feel as if I could have spent my time doing what I wanted to do instead of waiting on that person to show up to the party. I would then mingle around a little have a few drinks and begin small talk while I wait. Making sure to introduce myself so that I wouldn't look like just any old party crasher. I would begin to try to get my friend on the phone to find out where that person is and if they are still coming. Probably retreating back to my vehicle if no answer and heading back home, giving that person the cold shoulder for a while.",3.333333333
First off my friend is a jerk and does this to me all the time. What I usually do is make my way over to the drink table or find an alcohol station and get myself a drink. I would then try to find a group of people looking like they are having fun and try to make my way into the conversation. I would instantly introduce myself and explain my jerk friend is running late and try to break the ice by ragging on him. If that didn't work in would politely try to find a loner of the party or a pretty girl and make conversation. All in all I think I would be ok.,4.166666667
"I would feel really nervous and a bit stressed out. But I still would stay at the party. I would also call or text them asking where they were to see how late they would be, if they are still coming at all. I more than likely would just find a comfortable place to sit and then get a drink of some sort and sit and relax until the friend got there. Since I'm not a very social person, I highly doubt I would try and mingle or talk to anyone since as said above I don't know anyone there so I doubt I would be comfortable talking to anyone without my friend being there.",1.416666667
"This is a stressful situation for me, as I don't like being a stranger in such situations. I would feel as though I would either be kind of awkwardly around, or I would try to introduce myself to some people but feel as though I was forcing myself into their conversations a bit. Ideally I would find somewhere to kind of avoid being too involved with the party itself until my friend arrived and I at least had a decent way to kick off meeting some of the others. If that wasn't possible I would probably try to start a short conversation with the hosts, or whoever invited my friend to the party, using my friend being late as an excuse to initiate a conversation.",1.916666667
"I would try and call my friend first. I would want to know how far away they are, if they are still coming, etc. If I determine they are close I would leave and come back with the friend when they arrive. If they aren't coming I would also just leave. But if they are far away, I feel I would have to stay. So I would try and find a group of people to talk to. I would introduce myself and chat with them. Joining a group is good because there are multiple people to talk to as opposed to finding just one new friend.",2.833333333
"When I arrived and noticed that my friend had yet to arrive, I would be very nervous. In a room full of people that I do not know, and the only reason I'm there is my friend who may or may not arrive. I would attempt to get a hold of my friend through text first, so I wasn't on a voice call where anyone could hear me being nervous. If that failed, I would try to find a seclude spot to call to try to get a hold of my friend. I'm okay at putting on different faces so if I did get approached by someone I did not know I'm sure I could play it off and talk my way into a decent conversation with the stranger. If I did get a hold of my friend and I was waiting on them to arrive shortly, I would feel at ease and make my way towards the entrance to greet them. If my friend was going to be a bit then I would attempt to stay moving so I hopefully didn't get pulled into any conversations to make a mess of things for my friend.",3.666666667
I would feel super awkward and immediately regret my decision to go. I would be upset with my friend that is late and would contact her to see if she is close by and how long she would be. Depending on her answer I would leave especially if it's more than 5 minutes. I don't know the host of the party or the people and I feel like it would be wrong to kind of crash the party if my friend is not there. I tend to avoid parties like these at all cost. I feel like there is a much better way to spend my time. I would probably feel more like leaving immediately if my friend doesn't show up right away.,2.416666667
"Once I will reach to party and if I do not find my friend there then it would be little awkward situation for me as now attending party without friend would be like going to a party without any invitation. I do not think that I will go in party without my friend so first I will call and check with my friend. If he or she says that would be there in few minutes then I will wait for my friend. If my friend is late due to any reason then, I will go out and wait in some pub or other location. I may feel angry if my friend delayed without any proper reason but if delay was due to some actual reason then I can understand.",4.166666667
"I would feel very awkward being at a party that my friend had invited me to and he or she didn't arrive at the same time. I would probably wait in my car until my friend arrived as to not feel the awkward feelings of having to spend time with people I do not know at all. Depending on the situation and who the people were, I would perhaps introduce myself to see if they were cool and I could make a few new friends. It would very much be determined on a situation to situation basis whether or not I chose to engage.",4.5
I would feel kind of worried if it was a friend that is always punctual. I would contact them first to see if they are ok and if it was just a common delay then I would feel at ease after that. While I wait for the friend I would just try to network with the people around me at the party. I would try to connect and socialize until my friend gets here. I would thank the host of the party and just be myself as I wait for my friend. I would feel happy that I am able to make new connections and look forward to meeting them again when opportunities arises.,4.333333333
"When I arrived at the scheduled time, with a bunch of people at the party that I didn't knew, without a friend there to help me, I would feel immensely lost and scared. I'm not good around people and don't make new casual friends easily. I know how to have deep friendships and more, but I don't know how to get it to that point. I don't know how to maintain a friendship either, so I'd feel bad if I saw any old friends there that I didn't keep in touch with that may have wandered into this crowd. I would be hoping and begging for the friend to show up any minute, and I would keep messaging her often.",1.833333333
"I would be distressed to be at party where I am not familiar with anyone there. I would probably call my friend and see if I could get an estimated time of arrival, or send a text to see if she were on her way. I would probably not get out of my car and approach the party until my friend arrived. I would be worried about other guests wondering who I was and who I knew there. I might browse the internet or play a game on my phone while I was waiting. Depending on how late my friend ended up being, I might be upset if I had to wait for a substantial amount of time.",1.75
I would be a little ticked off at her. She wanted me to meet new people and I don't like meeting new people. Once my friend arrived I would tell her how disappointed I was in her. And I would have to think long and hard before I agreed to meet any one new again upon her request. I would keep my promise and meet her friends but would make it clear I would have to think long and hard before I would do it again. I would make it a point not to stay long to get my point across to her.,1.333333333
"I'd see if the host was available and go introduce myself to them. I'd explain to them that my friend was late but assure them that she would be showing up soon. I'd thank them for being able to attend their party. After that, I'd make my way to the bar where I would get a glass of wine. I'd look around the room to see if anyone looked interesting. If I saw an interesting person who looked friendly as well, I'd make my way over to them and start a conversation. I'd introduce myself and ask if they knew my friend. I'd ask them about themselves to see if we had anything in common.",4.583333333
"I'd be extremely nervous being alone at the party. I tend to need buffers in certain social situations, as I'm terrible at mingling and small talk and typically don't approach people to start conversations. I'd text my friend, berating them for abandoning me I also get very dramatic and ask when they plan on gracing me with their presence. I'd probably scope out the bathroom, see how much time I can reasonably spend in there, and emerge once my friend came out. I might also check out the food- nobody can talk to you when your mouth is full! I might also sit in my car. I'd like to minimize my social interaction.",1.25
I would definitely feel a little bit awkward because now I feel that I am at this party where I don't know anyone and I have to try to talk to someone. I would be a little bit upset that my friend because they are late and I was supposed to be here with them right now I am in this party with people that I do not know. I would feel very uncomfortable but I think I still will try to talk to people because maybe I could meet someone that is cool and he could reduce the social anxiety factor while my friend arrives.,2.583333333
I would feel a bit like I fish out of water not only do I dislike parties I hate ones that are very late and 9 pm is out of the normal time I like to be out and about as for what I would do while I am waiting I would try to find someone who looks bored and strike a conversation and see if we are like minded people also I would see if there is any good games being played if not I would just stand in a place without a lot of people and play some mobile games or something.,2.75
"I would feel very awkward. I will try not to draw attention as much as possible to myself. If there is food available, I would avail myself to the food to avoid having to talk to people. If I am feeling too nervous, I might even attempt to hide in the restroom. If I am feeling even worse, I might just leave the party and wait for my friend somewhere else so I can intercept my friend and enter the party together as a pair. If I don't leave, I would probably introduce myself to the host and just mill around unobtrusively while avoiding eye contact with anyone else.",1
"I would not really care that much if my friend was late- its a party and people are there to mingle and have a good time so why shouldn't I as well? I would talk to people, mingle and try to find some interesting conversation as I waited for my friend to show. I would assume at some point we would be meeting up so why not have a drink and some fun while I wait? Its nothing to talk to people- even if its superficial chatter to keep yourself entertained in the meantime. I think it would be actually a little fun to go to a party where I didn't know anyone.",3.916666667
"If my friend was late, I'd do the only thing I could do in this situation which is text my friend and see where they are and without a direct answer, I would outside the party and try to get acquainted with the other party goers and try to enjoy the evening to my best ability until my friend arrives, I'd probably text others I know to see if they are maybe at the same party and play mobile games while I sit. I wouldn't be angry with my friend cause I understand sometimes being late is out of your control.",1.833333333
"I would feel very awkward. I would probably try to find a quiet area to hide. If I couldn't, I would go and wait outside. I probably wouldn't have even gone to the party in real life because I think it's rude to go to someone's party that you don't even know. If that person invites you it still isn't the best time to meet someone, you'd be better off meeting them at a cafe or something beforehand. If I were really there I would wait outside and vape until my friend arrives. If she is more than an hour late I would go back home.",1.5
I would be very nervous going into a party where I know no one and I doubt I would go introduce myself to anyone unless someone specifically came up to me to talk first. As soon as I realize my friend isn't there I would go back outside and wait for my friend to show up. After a few minutes of waiting I would call or text my friend to make sure he or she is ok and nothing happened on the way. I would find out if they are still coming and I'd wait for them or I'd leave if they're not coming.,1.916666667
"I would really lonely at the party and I would be impatient to see my friend did not came for the party after inviting me. I will wait for some time and try to manage without him in the party. I would create new connections from the party, meet up with them and try to discuss with them more about the current conditions of the world. Then I would enjoy some drinks so that I can release my stress of him coming late at the party. Finally he will arrive and do the needful what was required by that person here.",3.583333333
"I would introduce myself to the host. I would tell them who I was meeting there and that he was late. I would try to find something to drink- preferably something with alcohol. I would have a drink or so to calm my nerves, then I think I would find a spot to sit. Once I sat down, I would try to look friendly and wait for others to approach me. If they didn't, I would pull out my phone and browse the web for a bit, or check my email or text messages. I might wander around a bit and grab a bit of food until my friend showed up.",2.166666667
"This situation would probably make me pretty mad. I don't like uncomfortable social situations and really don't like feeling alone in a group of strangers. If I drove to the part, I would honestly probably wait in my car till my friend got there. If I didn't drive or couldn't wait in my car, I would probably start drinking or something to reduce my tension a little. Doing something where I could focus my energy on not interacting with strangers would probably be my first reaction. I would definitely be pissed off that my friend put me in this situation and would consider leaving depending on how close I was to this person and how important the party actually was to them.",2.166666667
"I would enter the party, introduce myself to the host or hostess and try to strike up a conversation while I waited for my friend to appear. I would explain to people who I was and who the friend that invited me was. I would remain there until my friend showed up. If the situation proved to be uncomfortable for myself, which is unlikely, or the hosts, I would leave and wait outside. I would then explain to my friend why I had left the party and discuss with him whether I should return or not. I doubt that it would be a problem though as I am very sociable and easy to converse with.",4.333333333
"I wouldn't really be happy. I don't like going to parties, and the idea that I would be with a group who I don't know and waiting feels like a situation that I wouldn't want to be in. I am sure I would get something to drink and try to mingle around until she arrives, but I wouldn't like it. It would just mull around trying not to draw attention to myself. I would also suggest that in the future we meet up before going to the party so that I would not be in situations where I am stuck with people I don't know waiting for the person I do know so that I feel more comfortable.",2.166666667
"I would be very upset that my friend wasn't there when they told me they would be there. I would feel foolish walking into a party where I don't know anyone. I would text or call my friend and tell them how I was not happy they weren't there and to get there as fast as possible. I would try to go into the party and attempt to introduce myself and strike up a conversation with a person that's in the party. Once my friend got there, I would be pissed but I wouldn't stay mad for long and try to have a good time.",1.916666667
If my friends wanted me to attend an important party where I didn't know anyone there and she was not there or running late the first thing I would do is to text her to see how far out she is. Even if I do get a response from her I would call her to let her know that I was waiting on her to get there. I would probably then walk around to see if I know somebody or anybody to chat with. If not I would find a chair and probably just get on my phone for a few minutes. If my friend still has not arrived I would probably leave and sit in the car and wait on her so that we could walk in together.,2.416666667
"If this happened to me, it would be really awkward and rather unpleasant. I would really feel very self-conscious when I was waiting for my friend. I would want to find an excuse to go somewhere else until I could come back later. I would tell the others that I need to somehow get in touch with my friend before anything else happens. I think this might be the best way to avoid any awkwardness and to look like I am being a good friend at the same time. If this excuse did not work, I would at least try to find some common ground with the other people at the party.",2.083333333
"I would feel a little self conscious at first but would try to find out who was hosting the party and go introduce myself. I would attempt to meet some of the other people it the party and join in conversations where it seemed like I might have something in common with what was being discussed. I would have a drink and maybe something to eat. I would probably do some people watching and if it was a while before my friends got there, I would probably step outside and wait for him or her. If it got extremely late, like an hour or so, I would probably leave.",3.416666667
"I wouldn't feel any particular way but slightly annoyed maybe. First I would try to contact my friend and see what was going on, when my friend would get there. Then I'd probably spend a little bit of time scanning around. I'd try to see what sorts of people were there, make whatever superficial judgments I could to pass the time waiting. After that I'd probably get bored and go off in a corner to try to amuse myself with my phone or something. If people approach me to strike up a conversation, I'd engage, but I wouldn't look for any on my own really.",2.833333333
"This would be a very uncomfortable situation for me, as I am very introverted. The most likely scenario is that I would call or text my friend to see when they thought they would arrive or how much longer they would be. In the meantime, I would be feeling very uncomfortable and would probably keep to myself, probably sitting or standing awkwardly somewhere. I would probably look to see if there would food and or or beverages, and try to get something to eat to hopefully calm my nerves. In a best case scenario, I might find someone who looked friendly, or was very gregarious and might just come up and start to talk with me.",1.666666667
"I would probably watch for my friend for a while and wonder where she's at. I'd probably even call her and ask if she is going to get there pretty soon. Aside, from that I would wander around the party and try to talk to some people, maybe make some new friends. I'd see if there was something to eat or to do, while I was waiting. If the guests were playing a game or something, I would participate in that with them. If I couldn't find someone to talk to, I'd go wait by the window until my friend finally shows up.",4.5
"I would feel uncomfortable because I don't know the host or many other people there. I would probably shyly introduce myself as so-and-so's friend, and kind of hang out in the background a bit. I would send my friend a text to make sure nothing bad happened to them, because I would probably be worried especially if my friend was usually punctual. I would stay at the party until my friend got there or replied to my text to let me know what happened. Aside from that how long I stay would depend on whether I felt comfortable with this group of people and had maybe found someone else I could talk to, but I know I would feel a lot more comfortable if my friend ended up coming late than if they'd had an emergency come up and didn't end up making it. If it turned out my friend wasn't coming I'd probably excuse myself politely and head home early and plan to make it up to my friend somehow.",2.333333333
"Oh man, this sort of situation is awful. First I'd call my friend up and see where the hell they are, if there isn't a response I am out of there ASAP. If they say they're fairly close I'll just find a spot to stand and mind my own business. If they are more than 15 to 20 minutes out I'd tell them they're on their own and that I'm going home and to not put me in situations like this again. Though to begin with any friend of mine would know not to leave me stranded at an unfamiliar party, it'd be a quick way to end up on my bad side or stop being my friend altogether.",1.833333333
"I would feel a bit sad and disappointed, but if I know this friend is continually late, I would make myself at comfortable at the party. I would go in and introduce myself to the host and see if they know where my friend is or if they have heard from them. If it is a friend that is not late or timely, I will text and call them to see what the hold up is. I would wait outside for my friend if they are usually timely because it would be rude to go inside without them. If it is my friend that is always late, they will understand me going inside.",4.083333333

"I would not feel too good that my friend is late since they are the one that invited me. I would go and find the host and introduce myself. After talking with the host, I would go and mingle with the rest of the party guest until my friend came. I would try to find someone that I could have an interesting conversation with. I would also just spend some time just soaking in the atmosphere of the party. By the time I'm done mixing with other people hopefully my friend would had arrive and I would talk with them too.",3.666666667
"When I arrive at the party I would feel a little bit awkward. I would wish that my friend was there, and I would wonder how much longer it would be until they arrive. I would check my messages and texts to see if they said anything about running late. I would introduce myself to a couple of people and maybe get something to drink. I might make small talk or have a pleasant conversation with someone at the party until my friend arrives. I would walk around and familiarize myself with the place, and try to just act calm and natural, talking to anyone who says hello to me.",2.583333333
"I would do my best to socialize with the people there. I would introduce myself and explain that I was supposed to be here with so and so but he's running late. I would acknowledge the awkwardness of the situation and attempt to put the host and guests at ease. Once, that was accomplished I would try to enjoy myself and have stimulating conversations until my friend arrived. Once he did arrive, I would likely give him some good-natured ribbing regarding his punctuality, or lack thereof. I would then continue to engage people at the party and would likely feel more relaxed than I would have if I was just my friend's tag along, like we had originally planned.",2.916666667
"If I didn't know anyone, or if the host didn't know I was coming, I'd probably text my friend and see when they were coming. But I probably would go inside after that and mingle a bit. And I'd try to see out the host and maybe explain who I was, that I was friends with someone they knew and was invited so there wouldn't be any confusion. The last thing I'd want to do is cause problems for my friend for being late and maybe see if I could explain to them that they were running late. Of course this is how I'd react if it was an important party rather than an informal gathering as the protocol would be much different for the latter than for the former.",4.25
If I was invited to a party by a friend where I did not know anybody and I arrived before my friend then I would most definitely sit in my car until my friend arrived. I would probably call or text my friend to find out where he or she is so I know how long I would be waiting for him or her to get there. If it was going to be a long time I might just go home and forget the party. If he or she was close than I would wait until he or she got there and go inside with him or her. I would play games on my phone or go on social media until he or she arrived.,1.916666667
If I arrived at a party where I didn't know anyone and didn't see my friend I would immediately go back outside and probably smoke a cigarette because I get anxious around people I don't know. I would then proceed to call my friend and ask them where they are and why they aren't at the party like they are supposed to be. After smoking my cigarette I would go sit in my car and listen to some music because I know that music always makes me feel relaxed and at ease. I would then text my boyfriend and let him know that I'm at the party but still waiting in the car because my friend hasn't showed up yet.,2.083333333
I'd wonder where they are and give them a call to see if they're okay. If they're okay and still on their way I'd just head into the party and start mingling. First stop would be the food or drinks so I can get to it before they run dry. My friends own fault if he misses out on the goods! Once my friend gets to the party I'd head out to meet him so they could have someone with them to help them feel more comfortable with the party. Introduce them to any possible people I've met that I think they'd get along with and help them blend in.,4.166666667
"I would be feeling anxious in this scenario. I definitely wouldn't want to try to go into the party without them, since they were the one that was invited. So, if I drove I would probably sit in my car or if I took and Uber or walked I would find a nice place to sit for a while. I would wait a little bit then shoot them a text or a quick call to confirm that they were on their way. In the meantime, I would probably do something mindless like look at Twitter or Reddit on my phone to pass the time. In the back of my mind, I would still be wondering about my friend though. I would hope that they would show up soon so I don't look weird just sitting and waiting.",3
"If I arrived to a party in which I knew no one and was awaiting my friends late arrival, I would initially review the scene. I would then locate the bar and make my way towards it. After ordering my drink, I would again survey the room in an attempt to get a feel of the atmosphere and energy. I would pay attention to whom was talking with whom and which groups seem to meshing the best together and enjoying each others company the most. I would then strike up a conversation with the bartender in order to buy my friend some time and attempt to not look too uncomfortable.",4.333333333
"This is a somewhat awkward situation, but it would depend a lot on the context. Where is the party? How many people are there? Is food and drink available? It says this is an important party, so I'm imagining some kind of large gala situation, in which case it'd be easy to kill time by having a beer, sampling the hors d'oeuvres, wandering around, checking out the venue. I'd probably also text my friend and ask him what his ETA is. I'd people watch as well. Depending on the context and if I had anything in common with the event or occasion, I may also use that to strike up a conversation.",3.333333333
"It would be important for me to just let go of any negative feelings stemming from my friend being late or anything else, and to get in the mood to enjoy the party and mingle with people. I would want to feel relaxed and give a good impression to the people I am meeting, and if I am nervous then that would be a bad look. I would of course take the time to text my friend and make sure they are still coming to the party with me even if they are a bit late right now for whatever reason.",4
I am very silent person and I am not talk very much to other people who I do not know so it vis very bad situation for me because my friend come to me but he is late and I do not know about all party members and party host it is very different or difficult situation for me I am not talk other people who I do not know sometimes I think I leave the party but my friend is come soon so I adjusted the situation and people I just walk and take same water and breakfast it is very difficult to me to Handel this situation because I do not know all party members so I try to talk some to people to introduce my self and just talk to express my self.,3.333333333
"First, I would worry about my friend and check to make sure that he or she was alright. Then, I would make the best of the situation. While waiting for my friend to arrive, I would mingle with the people who were there. I would introduce myself and after making mutual introductions, I would see if the person I was talking with new my friend. If the person did, then I would steer the conversation to how both of us knew my friend and what the three of us had in common. If the person did not, I would just steer the conversation in a way that both of us could get to know each other better.",4.833333333
"I WOULD DEFINITELY FEEL AWKWARD BEING ALONE IN THIS SITUATION AND NOT KNOWING THE PEOPLE AROUND ME. I WOULD SAY THAT I WOULD INTRODUCE MYSELF TO SOME PEOPLE AT THE PARTY. I WOULD ALSO MAKE SMALL TALK AND ATTEMPT TO GET TO KNOW THE PEOPLE. I THINK I WOULD ALSO TEXT MY FRIEND AND MAKE SURE THEY GET HERE ASAP. IF IT GETS TOO AWKWARD, I MIGHT EVEN LEAVE THE PARTY BEFORE MY FRIEND ARRIVES. I WOULD MAYBE GO TO THE BATHROOM OR GO OUTSIDE TO AVOID BEING ALONE. I WOULD BE UPSET, BUT OTHERWISE FINE, THAT I WAS PUT INTO A SITUATION LIKE THIS.",3.083333333
I would go to the party since a friend asked me to go and I would want to not disappoint them but would feel awkward about the party since I do not know anyone and that would make me feel uncomfortable since I do not know anyone and this is not good but I am sure it will be fine and I will have fun since parties can be fun you know and I like to have fun so it will all be good in the end and it does sound like a fun event and my friend will be there who introduced me to different people.,2.666666667
"I would call my friend to know where he is and ask him to arrive as soon as possible. I would then go inside the party and get started. I would eat and drink something and then sit somewhere alone. I would try to watch it if there is some form of entertainment or if people are dancing on DJ. Otherwise I would just check my phone and do something on it to pass time. I would completely avoid interacting with people. I would try to find someone familiar, and if I do, I would spend rest of my time talking to him.",1.583333333
"I would be slightly annoyed as I don't like it when people are late to anything, never mind a party where I don't know anybody. I would try to find the host of the party in order to introduce myself so I'm not just standing around by myself. If there was some sort of group activity, I might try to join in if it was some thing I thought I could do. Otherwise, at this point, I would send a text to my friend to find out how late they think they would be. If nothing else is going on, I could always use my smart phone to pass the time.",3.25
"I would go in and start mingling, try to find a small group of people that might not know each other well. You can usually tell how well people know each other from their body language. I would go and introduce myself and attempt to engage in some light conversation. I would explain that I don't really know anyone here. I would ask if anyone would like to have a puff, and make it a little double meaning, so I can back out if I am partying with a bunch of nerds. If not, I'll explain that I have a really great bag of weed and we should go smoke some while we wait for some cool people to show up.",4.166666667
"I would feel aggravated and since I don't want to go to the party anyway, I would begin to give mental ultimatums to my friend so I did not have to go. If you don't show up in the next twenty minutes, I am not going. And it's your fault for being late! I would then start hoping against hope that my friend would never show up, and even feel a bit of relief when they didn't. However if they did show up I would probably be very disappointed but end up going anyway. If I could get away with it I would refuse to go but I doubt I would even try as I wouldn't want my friend to be angry.",1.083333333
"I would enjoy myself in the meantime. I would ask my friend first, however, if there is anything I need to avoid saying to some people or possibly just avoid in general. If everything is good to go, I would go ahead and enjoy the party as much as possible. I can say I'm good with socializing so meeting new people wouldn't be an issue for me. I wouldn't make myself the center of attention, though. I would still lay low until my friend comes because I would want my friend to be as comfortable as they can be. If this party is considered important to my friend, I wouldn't want to give the wrong impression to people that may look at my friend a certain way. However, can't be that important to my friend if my friend is showing up late to an important party. My friend would already be sending a message that doesn't involve me.",3.75
"I would definitely text my friend to make sure they are still planning to come to the party. Something may have come up and they are not able to make it. If they state that they are still coming, I would probably wait outside in my car if it's going to be just a few minutesless than 10 minutes. If it's longer that I would let the host know whos friend I am right away. I would not want them to think that I crashed the party. I would wait inside and introduce myself to at least one other person and try to converse or socialize until my friend arrives. Then join my friend when they get there and basically be their plus one or guest.",4.083333333
"If I arrived at this party and my friend had not yet gotten there, I'd feel very awkward about being there without them. I'd most likely try to contact them to see how much longer it would be until they arrived. If they were going to be a lot longer, I may choose to leave altogether or wait in an area where not many people were hanging out. I may also choose to wait in my car or outside where I will not have to talk to anyone. It would feel less awkward that way and I wouldn't have to interact with strangers.",2.5
"If I arrived there before my friend did and did not know any of the people at the party, I would probably just wait outside at my vehicle until my friend arrives. Being in an unfamiliar place with unfamiliar people is very awkward for me and I would feel very out of place, especially since I wasn't the one directly invited. If my friend is taking a while, I would probably browse the internet or social media and catch up with what is going on until my friend showed. If my friend was taking an extra long time, I would probably bow out of the situation and go home.",2.916666667
"I would feel anxious to be at the party without knowing the host nor the people attending. I would try to rack my mind of any memories of my friend mentioning the people at the party or  host and try to recall them. I would then try to engage in small talk with a few people and perhaps try to locate the people that are most acquainted with my friend Ie if the party is a group of coworkers, then I would try to find the group that works closest with my friend. While speaking with the people, I would mirror their opinions to minimize the chance of controversy Ie if someone were to bring up something about politics, I would monitor the reactions of the other people in the group and likely agree with their statement. I would also try to get people to talk about themselves since everyone loves to do that.",2.333333333
"I honestly would probably lay low at the bar or the food table. At least if I am at either of those places, I might come across a person who will start a conversation with me. Or I will find a place to sit and maybe just look at my phone until my friend comes by, at least with a drink in my hand so I look slightly social. If worse comes to worse and I feel like it is way too awkward, I will go to the bathroom for a while to waste time, before going back out to the party to go through all the motions again.",1.166666667
"I'm not sure I would go into the party if my friend wasn't there. I would text them and if they said they were on the way I would probably wait outside. But if I did go on I would have a hostess gift of some kind with me, wine, something I baked or made, and I would find the party host and introduce myself and give them the gift. Help myself to a drink and try to mingle. It would not be completely comfortable for me but it could also be a little freeing. I don't know these people and I may never see them again. If they don't like me it will not impact my life. I could have some interesting conversations while I wait.",3
"I would feel nervous in this situation. I would call him or her multiple times and start to be anxious, mainly if the other people that does not know me start to look at me a lot. If he or she is even more late, I would start to take some alcoholic drinks and start to drink myself alone. After that, I would try to start some type of conversation with the strangers, maybe about my life, maybe about news. Then I would come back and start to call him or her again and again until he or she answers the phone. I would be very frustrated if it does not happen.",2.75
"I would immediately call or text my friend to make sure they are still showing up. No way would I go inside if they weren't going with me. I am not that bold. If they were still coming, I would sit patiently in my car waiting for them. I would pass the time by looking at my phone and staying distracted. I wouldn't want anyone walking by think I'm weird or anything for still waiting in my car. When my friend arrives, I would meet up with them and entered the party with them. If I am going into a new situation, it helps me to not be alone.",1.333333333
"I would be highly irritated that my friend was late after talking me into a situation I wasn't comfortable with in the first place. I would call her immediately and inquire as to her whereabouts. If she was going to arrive within a reasonable time, I would wait for her to arrive. If she was rubbing too late, maybe more than 15 minutes or so, I would tell her I was leaving. I would not wait any more than that, as I feel being that late is extremely rude. If she was going to arrive in less than 15 minutes, I would most likely wait outside in my car, so I could avoid awkward contact with anyone at the party.",3.583333333
"I might attempt to look around to see if there is anything to do, like getting a drink or something to eat. Otherwise I would attempt to meet some people and ask how they know my friends, if I didn't just stand on my own social standing and introduce myself regardless. Being unfamiliar doesn't mean I can't find someone to talk to about something at the party. I might call or text the friend after a while since I would find it funny that a party starting rather late usually isn't attending fashionably late. Either way, I would attempt to do something constructive first and hope to start a conversation that burns some time until my friend finds me.",3.083333333
"I would feel irritated, as I didn't want to come to this party, anyway. I would wait for no longer than ten minutes, then I would leave, because I really wanted to go home. After waiting ten minutes, I leave, driving home. I would get home, then call my friend to chew him out for tardiness, as I find that an insulting waste of everyone's time, and is very disrespectful. So of course, he doesn't answer his phone, but the call goes to voicemail. By now, I've had too many vodka tonics to give a damn, so I go to bed.",3.333333333
"I would feel somewhat awkward and out of place. I might take part in the party activities and attempt to talk to a few people. Try to thank the host for allowing me to attend, compliment the party, etc. I would try to make the best of it, perhaps explore the party, dance, or get food or  drink if the vibe called for it. If it were not appropriate for me to head inside, I would possibly call my friend from the car or send her a text or  message and tell her that I'm here, ask how long she'll be there, if I can go inside or if she could call to ask if I can go inside, etc.",3.833333333
I would feel completely awkward that my friend is not there yet and that I do not know the people there. I will also feel somewhat angry that my friend is late. As a result I will make a mental note that I should not arrive on time or early to things like this. I will do my best to fit in and see if there is someone that I can manage to make small talk with until my friend arrives. If it takes my friend too long to get to the party there is a high chance that I will leave.,2.916666667
"If I arrived without my friend, it would make me feel very anxious. I am not good around people I don't know. I would probably wait outside until she got there. If I couldn't do that, I would go in and head to the bar. When I get nervous I start to drink. After a couple of drinks, if my friend still wasn't there, I would call her to see if she was close. I wouldn't stay there longer than 30 minutes without her. I would leave and go home. I would tell her that I would never agree to go anywhere with her again, unless we go together in the same car.",1.25
"First I'd try to call my friend and see what the hold up was. I wouldn't be too upset, my friend invited me in the first place so I'd consider it a bit of an honor. I'd probably check my phone for emails and messages and answer as warranted, read the major headlines on CNN and NYT. After that, if my friend still hadn't arrived, I'd probably just go to the party, introduce myself to a few of the more friendly or interesting looking party goers, have a drink and wait for him while I talk to this new group of people I hadn't met.",4.25
"If my friend wants me to attend an important party to which he or she has been invited and I have never met the host or familiar with the crowd of people that will be attending the party. I would still go as I love to meet new people and these new people might one day help me in my career or become one of my life long friend. If my friend is late to the party, I would still wait for him until he comes. I would constantly call him and see if he is having issues as he is being late to the event. I would feel sad if he is late, but I would still be glad at the fact that he invited me.",3.416666667
I would be rather upset with my friend for being late since I was doing them a favor by going to a party where I knew no one and was doing it for my friend. I would either stay outside waiting for my friend and have a word with her letting her know that she was not right to be late without calling assuming she failed to call and inform me that she would be late. I would only go inside if it was cold outside or if someone invited me to go in. In that case I'd try to talk to someone as I waited for my friend.,4
I would do what anyone does these days. I would loiter in the driveway or my car and fiddle around on my phone while waiting for my friend. It is really not a big deal whatsoever. I would text them to figure out how far away they are. But I would not really think twice about just waiting quietly outside. I am pretty sociable so it really would not be an issue either way. People run late. It happens. Why worry about something so silly and insignificant. I really do not have deep enough thoughts on such a trivial matter that I have 100 plus words to describe it but here we are. Glad you all must love reading nonsense.,3.25
I would feel very dumb to come early to this party and I would try to get in touch with my friend and see if they are coming to the party still if they are I will try to socialize with the folks in the building and have some fun if they are not coming to the party I will get back in the car and head back to my home and go watch a movie or something on netflix but I would be a bit upset if they did not show up to a party they wanted me to go to.,3.25
"I would introduce myself to the host and let them know my friend invited me to the party, just in case they were wondering who I was and what I was doing there. Then I would text or call my friend to see how long she was going to be. I would probably feel a little awkward about being around so many people I didn't know that well. So I would look for the people I knew the best and start a conversation with them while I waited for my friend to arrive. I would probably have a drink and get something to eat while waiting.",3.833333333
"I would probably go and get a drink or a snack if there was a buffet so that I had something to do with my hands. I would be a bit annoyed about my friend. I'd probably text them and ask why they were late when they promised to meet me there and I didn't know anybody. Most likely, I'd find somewhere to sit in the corner and read something if I could, because standing around without knowing how to join in would make me feel anxious. If someone started chatting to me, though, or there was a way to start a conversation, I would try and do that- I've done that before and had a good time!",3.166666667
"I would feel a little annoyed that my friend was late because I was already doing my friend a favor in attending this party to begin with. At first I would wait by my car and watch to see when my friend would arrive. If they still had not arrived, I would move towards the entrance of the party and wait there a little while longer for my friend to arrive. If other people were standing outside the entrance to the party, I would make small talk with them, and get to know them a little so that I would be a little familiar with some people when I finally did enter the party. If they still had not arrived, I would call my friend and ask them when they were going to arrive. If they were still on their way, and would be there soon, I would go ahead inside, introduce myself to the host, and tell them who I was, and who I was with and the situation, so they didn't think I was crashing the party. Then I would just mingle, and try to enjoy myself until my friend arrived.",3.833333333
"I would feel like my friends has very little respect for me. They should have at least called to tell me they would be late so I would not get there and be alone with no one I know. I would be nervous and seriously consider leaving the party. I would give them 15 minutes before I would leave. I would call them to find out exactly when they would arrive. I would probably go outside somewhere to wait until they got there so I would not have to be a round so many people that I did not know. Once they arrived, I would be annoyed but go in with them.",1.166666667
"I would text my friend to see how much longer she would take. Then I would wait in my car until she showed up. I would not walk in alone under any circumstance. I would play on my phone and get increasingly aggravated the longer it took her to arrive. I would have too much extra time to stress about not knowing anyone very well at the party. I would probably start to second guess my outfit and every decision about the night so far. If it too much longer, I might just text my friend to say I was going on home and not in to hanging out.",2.833333333
"I would feel incredibly awkward upon realizing my friend was not there. I would call my friend right away to see where they are and how much longer they will be. I would then get a drink or a snack if available and find a seat away from others. I would watch others interact rather than introducing myself, and try to stay out of the way as much as possible. If I had been sitting for too long, or others began to come up to me, I would find the restroom after they left me alone and hang out in there as long as possible without drawing attention to it.",1.833333333
"I would feel kind of agitated that my friend could not even make it to this important party on time and left me waiting. However, I would introduce myself to the host and explain that I am waiting for a friend and that they are late. I would apologize to them for my friend and ask if it was okay to wait for them inside where the party was happening. I would try to make small talk with the guests until my friend finally arrived and I would then let them know how disappointed I was that they left me there having to cover for them.",3.75
"I would feel more towards the neutral side, maybe some negative emotions. I think that I would feel a little uncomfortable. I think I would feel a little anxious. I would be a little annoyed that they left me waiting and now I have to stand there waiting for them. I would probably stick to my phone. I would be on my phone until they'd arrive. If someone approaches me and talks to me, I'd be fine to chat with them and if they invite me to join them, I would be happy to do so. I just don't see myself initiating approaching others.",3.416666667
"I would probably feel uncomfortable being around all of those people that I don't know. I wouldn't want to walk into the party alone because I wasn't the person who was invited and the host might question who I am. I get uncomfortable in large crowds of people that I do not know and that would probably give me a small bit of anxiety. It would be manageable, but would sit in my vehicle until my friend, that was actually invited to the party, shows up. Then we could go in together and it would be clear that I am his guest.",2.833333333
"I would feel a little uncomfortable and nervous at first, so I would wait by the door for about 5 minutes. Then, I would get into the bar line to grab a drink, keeping an eye on the door. Once I had my drink, I would return to the door. If my friend still wasn't there, I would text them that I was heading to the food table to grab something to eat. I would then start talking to others in line at the food table until my friend arrived. When they got there, I would introduce them to the new people I met.",4.416666667
"I would fell shame because I like to be at according time in places, I'll try to talk with people and blend in, have a pair of drinks and look at the girls specially the pretty ones, I may try to have a conversation with one and if the music is cool I may ask her to dance, there is no need to be shy while I wait for my friend, I will also try to call him or whatsapp him to check if he is okay and if he can come so I will not be there waiting for him all night.",4.666666667
"Honestly, I would feel kind of annoyed that my friend was late, but I would not say that to them. If I drove, I would wait around in my car until they arrived, or if I took public transportation, I would probably go for a walk nearby, while I waited for my friend to come. I would either play games on my phone while I waited, or just play around on the Internet while I waited for them. I would definitely wait for them before I went into the party, since I do not know anyone else that is attending, and I would feel awkward to go in by myself.",4.75
"I would go to the door and go in. I would make sure to greet the host right away and explain who I am and how I am at the party, that my friend is coming but they are running late. Then, I would find out if there are any snacks or drinks, and I would make sure to smile and say hi to people as I walked past them. Once I get to the snack area, I would make small talk with several people as we got our snacks. I would then go out into the party area and try to join a conversation of group people already in progress.",3.75
"I would feel a little odd, but I would quickly look for someone to connect with. I know that people are all looking for connection with others and this would be my chance to talk to someone that I had not met before and see how they view the world. I would engage with them and let them know who I am and hopefully learn something from them and maybe they could learn something from me as well. I would talk about issues that we both were interested in and maybe we could become friends. I might also sit down if everyone was closed off cause you cannot force an interaction with anyone.",3
I would have brought a bottle of wine or some kind of gift to show my appreciation of letting me be there and would give that to the host. I would introduce myself and express my apologies for my friend being late and explain that my friend had invited me. I would assume that the host would lead me to the drinks so I can then pour myself a drink. I would try to make myself look busy whilst doing that and maybe smile and try to make eye contact with someone. If I managed to make eye contact I can then carry a conversation which would then not make me feel so uncomfortable while I wait for my friend.,4.166666667
"Once I arrived at the party, I will search for my friend or any other faces that I can recognize. If I found no one, I will keep on waiting for my friend. After some time, if he didn't turned up, I would like to make a call to my friend and ask him, when he would come. Based on his response, I will wait further by surfing my phone by seeing social medias, watching videos or playing games. This would pass my time until my friend reaches the party. If it is still delayed, I will take a dinner in case if I feel hungry or introduce myself with the party organizers.",3.75
"I would probably Not be too bothered at first because everyone runs late sometimes. At about 9 15 I would text them to see where they are. If I hadn't heard from them by 9 20 I would be irritated. I'd be doing my best to quietly socialize and definitely drink a beer. If they hadn't arrived or contacted me by 9 30 I would leave and I'd be pretty upset. I would be cursing them a bit as I drove home, and I would probably stop and get an ice cream. I would go home and watch Netflix and go to bed early and I would text my friend something passive aggressive and hope they felt bad about it.",2.25
I would feel just fine because I have no problem meeting and talking to new people or being in new or unexpected situations. I wouldn't mind that my friend is late because everyone runs late sometime. I would enjoy myself at the party by introducing myself to new people and starting up some conversations to get to know people. I would also enjoy myself by helping myself to the food and beverages that would likely be offered at the party. I might call or text my friend to see where they were if they were more than thirty minutes late but not until then.,4.916666667
"I would feel very out of place arriving at the party and my friend is not there yet. I would be too embarrassed to go into the party without the friend. I would not feel the right to go in without my friend because it was not me who was invited, it was my friend. There would be nothing for me to do until my friend arrives. I would wait in my car until my friend arrives. I'd be somewhat angry that my friend invited me to a party and they didn't bother to show up on time. If my friend was more than 15 or 2 minutes late, I would likely leave the party and go home. Before I left I would call my friend to find out if they were alright. If they were safe, just late, I would wait if they were close. If they were not close, I would leave and likely be rather angry with them for putting me in this position.",4.083333333
"I would feel very nervous about going in, and I may wait in the car if I knew my friend was going to be late before I got there. I would feel weird about going into someone's house alone whom I have never met before. If I did not know my friend was going to be late ahead of time, I would likely try to find a drink or a snack or something to keep my hands busy. I may wander around and see if anyone strikes up a conversation with me. I would likely move from room to room and try to find something to do, like watch TV or hang out with a large group of people who are already talking.",2.666666667
"I would feel very uncomfortable as these type of situations are pretty much my worst nightmare. I'd probably hide in the bathroom until my friend arrived, texting them until they got there. If that was not an option I might go back to my car and wait or get some food and drink preferably alcohol and find the family pet so I could buddy up with them. I would not mingle, I would not try to be a social butterfly. That is just not in my nature. I would be wishing and hoping my friend would get there as soon as possible.",1.583333333
"I would probably wait outside because I don't know anyone at the party. It would be strange for me to just go in a home of someone I don't know and someone who didn't invite me to their party. I would probably text my friend and ask where they were and how long until they arrived. I would feel irritated, disappointed and like I just wanted to go home. It's already uncomfortable going to a party where you know no one, but now I'm stuck at night in an odd place by myself. If my friend doesn't arrive within a few minutes, I would probably decide to leave.",3.5
"Parties and events like this are really not my thing and people who know me well are aware of this. I don't really like late evening events either. I would probably feel like I was doing this friend a big favor by agreeing to go at all, so yeah, I would feel put out if my friend wasn't there at the time we agreed on. Honestly, I don't think I would even go to a party by myself. I would tell my friend to pick me up so I could walk in alongside someone, but if the planets aligned in some weird way and this did happen I would do a thorough search of the party and maybe ask a few people if they had seen my friend, depending on how approachable others seemed and how insecure I was feeling. I might grab a drink if I was feeling marginally comfortable. I would wait for a short time depending on how good of a friend this was, 20 minutes seems fair to me, but if my friend hadn't shown up by then or contacted me in some way to let me know what was up I would leave.",1.75
I would feel very awkward so I would try to wait outside or find a quiet place by myself inside to sit and wait for my friend. If she took a really long time I would eventually start walking around and maybe introduce myself to people and try to find the person hosting the party to introduce myself and tell them I learned about the party through my friend and I am waiting for the friend to show up. Then I would get a drink and just try to have some fun while waiting and if she takes longer than an hour or so I would just leave and go home.,2.916666667
I am nervous. I would debate whether or not I should leave and them come back. I would probably decide that it would be best to suck it up and go to the party. When I got there I would make brief talk with the host and tell them why I was there and who I was waiting for. After that I would go get a drink or some food and then I would find a quiet area to sit and not look awkward. I have no problem striking up conversations but I know some times people don't love that. I would sit on the couch and look occupied by my phone unless someone approached me.,4.166666667
I am not very shy. I would introduce myself. I am pretty good at striking up conversations. I would see someone that looks pretty congenial and try to find some commonality. I would then ask them about the host or others at the party. I would then look for other ways to introduce myself. I have been at parties that I ended up talking to the butler and serving attendants. There is always someone to visit with. Someone always has an interesting story or past that I find fascinating. I love people and I love making connections. You never know many people you meet know others that I know. It really is a small world.,3.583333333
"I would feel a little disconcerted for a second. If there were duties they needed to perform, I would step in, and try to compensate for my friend's lateness. Otherwise, I would go around and introduce myself to people. I would strike up conversation, enjoy the food and atmosphere. I wouldn't worry too much about them being late. If they were more than 15 minutes late, I would call them on the phone, to ensure they were alright, or to see if I needed to do anything for them. I would also take into consideration their past behavior, if they had been late frequently, or were driving in a bad area of town.",4.5
I would feel extremely anxious. I don't like going to parties and I would feel very uncomfortable being there with no one I really knew. I would likely find a quiet corner and hide there until my friend arrived. I doubt I would engage with strangers. I would also probably text my friend constantly and tell him or her to hurry up before I went home. If there was food available I guess I'd get a snack and go back to my hiding spot. I'm observant so I'd probably watch what people did and said just to learn about others. When I arrived home I'd think about why someone said what they said or did what they did to determine any underlying meaning.,1.5
I would feel uncomfortable and I would definitely call my friend and ask where he or she is and how long when he or she will be here and ask what I should do or where I should wait. I might walk around while waiting and might see if there is anything around that I would enjoy doing while I am waiting for my friend. I would play the game on my phone if there is nothing that I could do around or call and talk to my friend until he or she will be here. Otherwise I might be bored and upset as I would not like to do nothing.,2.75
"I would feel rather awkward and uncomfortable. As an introvert, I would want to be around someone I know as I'm getting acquainted with new people. I would probably pace around and get strange looks from people. I would search for a familiar face in the crowd, and failing to find one, I would get a drink and settle in to a quiet part of the event and browse my phone. I wouldn't proactively try to introduce to any one, since I'm really not comfortable doing so. If 30 minutes or so go by with no update from my friend, I would head out.",1.75
At first I would feel really tensed because I don't know anyone in the party and even I am not much familiar with the host who conducts the party. I would frequently call my friend to know about the location where he is. I would manage myself to act in a way that I am familiar to the host. I would like to keep myself busy in the party like attending phone calls are browsing something in my mobile so that others would never mind me or approach to talk to me till my friend arrives. I would scold him after he has arrived.,3.083333333
I was feel so awkward. I am not good in social settings where I don't know anyone. I would probably say hi to everyone and make an excuse to go outside so I don't have a panic attack. I would call my friend and ask why they are late. I would then wait in my car until my friend showed up to ensure I don't go back in there without them. I would be mad but honestly I understand that things happen like traffic and it not the biggest deal in the world. As long as I didn't completely embarrass Myself I would go back into the party when my friend arrived.,2
"I would wait on my friend to show up. I would sit in my car if I have driven. I did not drive, I would wait outside. If there are people outside I would introduce myself to the people. I would tell them the name of my friend and how excited I am to be a part of the party. If there is no one outside I would get on my phone and read a book or get on social media and scope out what is happening on there. Once my friend gets there then we can go in and mingle.",3.75
"That really depends on the nature of the party. Some get togethers even when informal in dress and such Starting conversations is more akin to breaking into conversations, which is very difficult to pull off without causing some disruption. Immediately give off the feeling of close groups of friends and sort of closed to those outside the circles. I would for the short term try to get into the look of the group. Get a drink, wander around purposely feigning nonchalance. Greeting others familiarly and such. If it was more the rave type of active party, joining right in would be fairly easy. Of course I could scope it out and return outside and call him, figuring that this would take some inside knowledge.",4.166666667
I would be at first off put that my friend is not there. I would probably call them and ask them what there ETA was. If it was somewhere close I would see my waiting outside the party. I would not want to go by myself because I don't know anyone. I would feel uncomfortable. I sometimes like to entered parties with people and friends because it's like putting on a show. I want to be seen and make for a fun entrance. Overall I would not be too mad about it all because its not a big deal. I could also see myself just going in by myself and grabbing a drink.,3.833333333
"Upon arriving and parking my car I would first call or text my friend. Learning they are running late and not quite there I would simply wait in the car. Texting or calling every ten minutes asking for updates. I wouldn't go inside to the party. I don't know who the host is or any of the guest. I have no reason for being there as far as the host is concerned. My friend would get a 25 minute window to show up if he or she wants me there with them. After that, I would leave. I'm doing a favor for this person, they cannot take the time to be where they had asked me to be. I would be more annoyed then anything.",2.833333333
I would just text my friend or try and call her to see what is going on. I most likely would try and find the host and introduce myself and mention my friend so things will not be super awkward. I would also maybe mingle in with the crowd somewhat. I would also probably go outside and catch some fresh air and also wait until my friend arrives. I probably would call someone while I am outside or I probably would go on social media. This would keep me from feeling too out of place. Overall- I would do something to keep me preoccupied and not looking and feeling awkward. I would also call my friend and have her give me some type of updates or maybe just be on the phone with her until she arrives.,2.666666667
"I would feel nervous that they aren't going to come and I will be at this party all by myself. Since I was not invited, it would be awkward. While I wait for them, I will step outside and stay away as best I can since I am not invited and don't want to feel any such questions. I'd rather wait outside than be in there with all the rest of people. That would be much easier for me to deal with and then when my friend gets there then I go in with them. If they cannot get there in a certain time, I am going to leave though as I am not going to be waiting outside forever. That would be awkward as well.",5
"I would be horrified. I am socially anxious so going to a party in the first place is traumatizing. I would feel incredible anxiety because of my friend's absence. I would try to stay away from the crowd of the party and would text my friend to see where they were. If they were close, I would wait off to the side for them to arrive. If not, I would try to discretely leave the party until they get there at least. I would try to avoid socializing because it would make my anxiety worse than it would already be. I would be very upset with my friend as well.",1
"I would feel annoyed and frustrated that my friend is late. I would choose to not go into the party until my friend arrived. I would most likely sit in my car on my phone until I knew that she was there. I am not a big conversationalist and since I don't know any of the people attending the party or the host, I would not feel comfortable going in alone. I would call my friend to see how late she was going to be and tell her I was going to meet her in the parking lot because I don't feel comfortable going in alone.",2.916666667
"I would certainly feel irritated by my friend's not being there yet, but I wouldn't be discouraged. I would take this awkward situation as an opportunity to make an interesting entrance. I'd introduce myself and explain that I'm XXXX's friend and that s or he is running late. There's no sense in being socially awkward just because a friend isn't available to serve as a greeter or intermediary or envoy or whatever you want to call it. By showing my willingness to blend in without my friend, I am setting a good first impression. There's no downside, really. If they find it creepy then it's on their own socially awkwardness, not mine. My friend will likely be pleased that I was able to intermingle without his or her help- I'm sure they would be feeling quite a lot of anxiety and guilt as they arrived.",3.666666667
"I would call my friend and ask for the real-time he's expecting to arrive at the party. To save myself from embarrassment, my best bet would be waiting for him at the reception, I wouldn't risk entering the event venue without him. I would also put on a friendly face for all the guests who say hello to me as I wait for my friend. To pass time, I would keep myself busy on my smartphone. In case security or even the ushers deemed me suspicious, I would be very cooperative, explain to them how I got there and who I was waiting for.",2.916666667
"Assuming I knew my friend was late because I called them and they told me so, I would enter the party and introduce myself as a friend of so-n-so to anyone who looked interested in me being there. As I make my way to the bar, I would keep an eye out for who appeared to be the host or hostess and pour myself and drink or beer and mingle around, looking for the food. Take in the surroundings and try to notice the genre of the music and the atmosphere it created. I like to play guess the nationality and would consume myself with this mind game until my friend arrived but would also be open to conversation.",3.416666667
"First of all, I would not wait. I would text or call and let them know that it is extremely rude to be late. I was extending the courtesy of actually inviting them to a party that they weren't invited to initially. I do not have time to just wait around for them while I could be at the party. It also depends how late they are, but if it is just 2 to 3 minutes, then I'd be completely fine with in, but I will not wait that long because it's rude. I would not feel any kind of way about it, I wouldn't be upset with them or anything.",3.333333333
I would really feel very bad as I am not very much a part hard person. I would be very angry towards my friend about being late for the part as I do not know the host or other people attending the party. I will also curse my friend in my mind as she was the person who insisted me to attend the party even though I was never interested in such an event at that time of the night as I usually watch television shows during those hours or will be doing my work from home jobs or having dinner with my husband. I would spend that waiting time by surfing Facebook or Instagram stories.,2.5
"When I realize that my friend will be late at the party. I will decide to wait to wait for her at the party and Meanwhile I would like to greet the person who will be hosting the party and for this I will make a phone call to my friend and ask the name of the person who is hosting and party, After that I will personally approach the host and greet him wishes for the party and also I will explain him about the situation that I am his friends friend and as she is late and she had asked me meet over here at the party, I am waiting for her. Besides, I would like to ask few questions from the host about his family and how and where he met my friend. Also I would like to interact with other people at the party who are sitting alone.",3.666666667
Well I enjoy parties and don't really mind mingling with people I know so I'd play it by ear and see how much fun it actually was. I mean this totally wouldn't let my friend off the hook and I'd make sure that he knew I was irritated with him for being late which I would hope he had a good reason. But yeah most likely I'd stay and have fun. Especially if there was alcohol there I could easily pass the time drinking and chatting it up with these new people. If he took to long say like 2 hours and I wasn't having fun I'd definitely go home but if I was enjoying myself I'd stay whether or not he showed up at all.,3.75
I would have tried to find out the relationship of each person by keenly observing. Otherwise I would have sit quietly in this situation until my friend arrives. Otherwise I would have started chatting with that friend about where she is or busy with surfing on internet. Or tries to make a call to know about the host of the party. I feel more uncomfortable about this but try myself to control my discomfort. I would have started surfing on internet about how to avoid such incidents or try myself to get to know about the host of party and my friend relation with the host. So that I can ask permission or try to apologize about joining the party without being invited.,3.333333333
I would feel pretty annoyed with my friend and awkward in this situation. I think the first thing I would do is try to find some food and drinks to keep myself occupied. I would try and find a nice little discreet corner and sit or stand there and eat and drink until my friend got there. I would avoid talking to anybody and would use my phone as a way of letting people know that I'm not interested in chatting if they looked over at me. I would try to look busy or preoccupied to avoid socializing until I absolutely had to.,1.25
"I would feel so hesitate to attend the party especially when you find no company but still I will try to make friends in there as don't want to hide myself out there. I can arrange party things and meeting new peoples who are around there and start conversation especially with same age peoples and girls, It's best to have this conversation in person Let them know you were definitely not invited and you'd like to know if there you can introduce your friends. If foods are arranged I can help people to serve them and prepare them happily and connected to them.",4.25
"First, I call my friend and inform him that I am present at the party and I am feeling alone and ask him to reach as soon as possible and then I will have a glance at the party and to spend time till the arrival of friend I will have a look at the decoration at the party and the event organized there and then try to interact with the people who look somewhat friendly try to ask there name, place of residence there work and try to speak some more words and then tell him about my friend and then wait for the arrival of the friend.",3.916666667
I would feel annoyed with my friend for being late. They asked me to go and told me the time so it would be upsetting to think they wouldn't be on time. I would spend the time waiting in my car doing stuff on my phone. I would also listen to music to relax while I am waiting. Then I would think about what I will say to my friend when they get to the party and want I would talk about with others at the party. Then make a plan for when I will leave and what I will do after the party.,4.416666667
"If I agreed to go to an important party with my friend, but have never met the host, and are not very familiar with the crowd of people who are at the party, but my friend was late, I would wait in my car. I wouldn't feel bad about it, nor would feel any pressure to go in without my friend. I would try and call my friend to see where they are and what their estimated time of arrival was. If they didn't show up within a reasonable amount of time and they don't pick up their phone, I would leave.",1.916666667
First I felt guildy because of met unknown peoples but I will go the party because of my friend. In that party I will make friends who are presented in that party because I think my friend's friends are also like my friends I know first its all are uneasy to make a friendship in new people but what can to do that party was bery important to me this is my most valuable friend so I definetely go to the party and enjoy the party with all others presented in that party. Its new feel to make a new peoples as my friend in short time period this increase my good habits.,3.083333333
"I would feel incredibly awkward and slightly annoyed with my friend since she knew I didn't know anyone attending. I would try calling my friend to see what their estimated arrival time would be. In the meantime, I would seek out refreshments or food if there was an area for it. I would then find somewhere out of the way to sit while waiting for her. If someone was sitting nearby, I might try to start a conversation but only if it came up naturally. If the wait went on too long, I might start looking through my phone to occupy myself.",3
"I would feel awkward and very anxious. I would greet the host and introduce myself and let them know my friend invited me and that she was not there yet. I would say hi to others as I am walking through. I would grab a beverage and walk outside to call my friend. If she did not answer. I would begin to text her frantically. I believe that I would wait about 15 minutes, and most likely leave if she did not return my call to reassure me she is on her way. After that I would let the host know I was leaving.",3.333333333
"I would certainly wait a while for my friend, but text him right away once I got their and wait for a response. In the meantime I would mingle and see what other people are doing and maybe introduce myself to the host. If my friend did not show up within a half hour of 9 then I think I would worry a bit and start calling to see if he is OK. Staying at the party would be fun but knowing my friend is OK is more important. I think that having someone there who knows other peple is good and I would stay a bit to see if he shows up so I could be introduced and get to know others there.",3
I would feel nervous myself but just would stay relaxed. If would contact my friend and determine how far away and then go from there. If they are a long ways away I would enter the party and introduce myself to the host. After this I would look around for something to drink and maybe a snack in order to kill time. After this I would go outside and smoke a cigarette until my friend arrives or look for people to introduce myself to. If my friend was going to be arriving shortly I would probably wait out in my car until they arrived.,3.666666667
"Initially, I would somewhat freak out. I may call someone to check and see what's going on, more likely, I will leave the building to protect myself because of uncertainty. If somehow I cannot reach someone in time, I will make sure to inform my boss what's going on to avoid further problems arising, making sure everyone is not in danger. The last thing I would do is fix the problem, considering this is something to be resolved by a professional and not taking any chances to avoid consequences. If I reached out to someone, I will feel less worry.",1.75
"I would of course feel very out of place. I would wonder what is keeping my friend. I would smile and be friendly and introduce myself to the host, after I find out from someone who the host is. I would then let them know I was the friend of a friend who had not yet shown up. I would then find an available space with not so many people standing. I would call my friend on my cell phone and see whether they are on their way. If they say they are on the way. I will wait for them.",4.083333333
"When I arrive there, I would grab a drink and just relax until my friend comes over to the area. I would feel comfortable at the venue but not too comfortable. I will make sure that I am not being too rude to the host and introduce myself to people who seem interested but of course, introduce myself first to the host, make sure he knows who I am and why I am invited to the party. I would just keep my composure honestly, since I am at a very important party that my friend has and she invited me, to me that excites me as a friend of hers and I would not make the situation awkward.",3.5
"I would feel so awkward. I would not know what to do. I would prob go find a drink and something to eat and then just sit in the corner by my self. Or better yet, I could find some dogs or animals and then I could pet and play with them. Because in reality animals are so much better than people and I think that is important to note. I would also be really mad at my friend. I do not think I could talk to them again for a while after that. I would definitely want them to know that I am angry and do not appreciate them being late.",2.333333333
I would feel very nervous and out of place at the party waiting for my friend to show up. I would walk around and maybe approach someone that looked approachable to start a conversation. I would try to have fun or keep busy and entertain myself. I would feel scared but I would fake it until I made it. I would pretend I was a social person and just get through the evening. I would feel exhausted trying to maintain myself. I would keep watching for my friend to show up.,1.333333333
"I would feel agitated that she was late when I didn't want to go to begin with. I would turn my car lights off and sit and browse the internet while I waited. I would not go in because I am not very familiar with the people there. I would become very frustrated but would try to browse online shops or clean out my email while I waited, and consistently try to get her to hurry up. When she finally arrived I would be very cold to her and want to leave asap.",1.916666667
"I don't think I would go into the party until I knew my friend had arrived. I would have texted them before I went inside the door to see where they were first. I would never go into the party if I knew no one there and I knew my friend wasn't there either. If I accidentally went in, I would hope I was greeted by someone. If not, I would likely go find a drink or some food and maybe a corner to sit in until I found my friend.",2.333333333
"I would feel a bit uncomfortable knowing that I did not know the host but I would introduce myself as so and so's friend. Then maybe I would see if there are any familiar faces to talk to. If not I would probably just wait around until my friend got there, this would either be outside or inside just depending on the weather and social situation. Hopefully my friend would not be to late because is they were I would probably become a bit uncomfortable and want to leave after a while.",4.416666667
I would feel awkward and mad. She should have made sure she was on time as she knew I didn't know anyone. I would be hurt and seriously thing about going back home. I would get me a drink and look around and see if I knew anyone. If I did I would go talk to them. If I didn't I would try and figure out ho the host was. I may strike up a conversation with someone there while I wait. I may go to the restroom and kill time to give my friend time to get there. I would watch the time also.,4.25
"If my friend was late for the party and I was there alone, I'd feel pretty anxious, but I'm used to interacting in social situations, so I'd grab a drink and try to find the host or hosts to introduce myself. I'd be mindful of making a good impression. I'd be honest with the host and let them know I don't know anyone at the party, and ask if they could make some introductions for me. I'd then do the best I could to make conversation and ask people about themselves. I'd also text my friend and ask her to hurry up.",2.166666667
I wouldn't panic. I would maybe call them to see if things were okay and if they needed help. You never know if something bad could have happened and I would seem to be caring if I did that. I wouldn't panic but I might get slightly nervous as I am not a huge people person and not sure how to handle myself with new people to a high degree at first. I might feel sad most of all until they showed up and maybe just fake things as if I wasn't unhappy.,2.5
"I would feel unappreciated and somewhat betrayed. I would wait outside of the party for a little while in hopes of re-entering the party again with my friend who could introduce me to others. If my friend continued to be late, I would go inside and maybe grab a drink while trying to strike up a conversation with others without intruding too much. If that didn't work, I would play on my phone for a little while to give my friend a little more time after which I would probably leave the party if I were not enjoying myself.",3.833333333
I would feel a lot of anxiety and would probably start panicking. I am one of those people who does not like to enter room when there are other people there. So instead of sticking around at the party I would probably go back out to my car and wait there. I would sit in the car and try calling and or texting my friend to find out where they are. I would continue to wait in the car until they get there. I will kill time by looking up stuff on my phone.,1.916666667
"I would feel a little anxious being around people that I did not know very well. I would probably hang back a while, texting my friend wanting to know where the heck they were at. I would be listening to various people talk amongst themselves trying to find something that I have in common with them. This way I don't look like the wierd guy that's standing in the corner that no one seems to know. I'm sure after a while I would have heard something from someone that I can talk to and relate to them with. I probably would stand near them and ask them a question to get invovled in the conversation without being rude. After I get that introduction I ususlly don't have a problem continuting the conversation with people, so I would probably talk until my friend showed up.",3.75
"I would introduce myself as a guest of my friend and explain that we were meeting each other there, but obviously I had arrived first. I would try and start conversations with a variety of people and let them know who I was and why I was there. I would try to get to know people, without being too aggressive, so that it seemed I was comfortable in the setting with or without my friend. I wouldn't want her to feel awkward that she was running late, or that I was being a wallflower waiting for her. I would feel a little upset that she left me hanging, but some things are avoidable. It would be fine. I would feel like I could hold my own and meet several people prior to her arriving.",3.416666667
in a situation like this I would feel very awkward and more than likely I would speak to the host and everyone in attendance but I would definitely show how shy I am and how reserved I am. More than likely I would not make eye contact but I would say hi and message my friend or call and ask when they're showing up. I would feel so out of place and feel like I just don't belong at the event. I usually would go to the food section and eat while standing in a corner and avoiding everyone until my friend arrives.,1.416666667
"I would be so nervous because I would not know who to talk to or who these people were. I would probably find my way to the nearest snack area or find a pet, these are good things to distract shy people. I might sit somewhere sort of isolated and stare at my phone hoping my friend arrived soon. I may also take a prolonged trip to the bathroom to try to avoid the awkward socializing. If there was alcohol at the party or other substances I would probably nervously begin to get intoxicated.",2.833333333
I would feel a little awkward and shy. I would be a little annoyed at my friend that he was late and left me at a party not knowing anyone. However I would go find the food to distract my self and stuff my face. I would just grab a plate and eat and see if there are any familiar faces around. If not I would probably just eat and after that go find somewhere to sit down and just patiently wait. If someone approached me I would talk to them other wise I would just wait for my friend to show.,2.916666667
"I would feel awkward not knowing anyone at the party and showing up without the friend who invited me. I would also feel embarrassed and as maybe everyone was staring at me or wondering who I was and what I'm doing there. I'd likely be trying to hide myself beside a tree, bush, or maybe go to the restroom. If not, I'd likely just be staring at my phone to avoid others coming to talk to me without my friend being there. I'd be extremely nervous and anxious about when my friend was actually going to arrive.",1.25
"I would try to find some people to talk to at the party. There would probably be food and drinks. I am usually good at finding people to talk to at parties. Once my friend came I would probably mainly just talk to them. I assume that the friend is a female. The female friend is probably my date or girl friend. Once that person got there I would feel a lot more at ease. It is always tough talking to strangers at a party, but once you are there it is easy to get to know people.",3.916666667
I would feel really awkward and wish I was anywhere else but there. I would then go outside and sit in my car while I waited on my friend. I would feel out of place and uncomfortable going in there and waiting by myself. I would occupy my time with doing something on my phone. I would feel anxious and annoyed. I would probably sit in my car and just try to be calm and not think about being worried. I would call my friend to ask where they are and how long it will take them to get there. I also would have thoughts of just leaving and going back home.,1
"In this situation I would most likely head inside to the party, if my friend is friends with the people here than I am sure I would be able to get along with them as well. New situations do not bother me and although I am a quieter person I have no problem making pleasantries with new people that I meet. I'm sure my friend is just running a little late and this will give me an opportunity to meet some of his friends and perhaps make some new ones of my own.",2.75
"oh dear, I'd say it depends on how the other people are. When I'm on the same wavelength with you, I think I get on with you quite well. But as a rule it is the case that most people are rather boring and I would feel very uncomfortable. Maybe I would wait outside and smoke a cigarette. And as long as my friend doesn't show up, I would still wait outside. There is nothing worse than being surrounded by people with whom I cannot do anything. If he will not show up, I would definitely go home.",3.25
"I would find me something to drink. I would call my friend or text them and ask them where they were. Then I would probably introduce myself to everyone and tell them who I'm supposed to be there with and that they are running a little late, just so they didn't think there was a complete stranger at their party. I'm sure I would end up making friends with someone. I wouldn't be mad at my friend, I understand sometimes people are late or maybe something came up. No need to get mad over it.",5
"I would wish that I had drove to the party with my friend so we could go into the party together. I would try and call my friend to see where she was and what time she would be arriving. I would stay in my car until she arrived, but I would be on the look out for her. I definitely do not want to go into the party alone since I do not know anyone there and I have never met the host. I would go into the party with my friend if I was able to meet up with her. Otherwise, I would go home, annoyed that my friend had been so inconsiderate of my feelings and my time.",2.583333333
"This is literally nightmare territory for some people! I would initially feel a little frustrated that my friend would come late knowing I didn't know the people at the party. Depending on why or how I knew the friend I would proceed in. In general, my friends are good people with a lot of interesting hobbies. Going in I could expect something similar. This would allow me to feel out the room ultimately, though the host may be initially confused. I suspect the host would still let me in to the party even though my friend hadn't arrived yet. If they didn't, I suppose my host would tell me a lot about themselves though!",3.416666667
"I would definitely feel anxious without her being there to meet me. I would probably go in first and then if I found out she was not there yet, I would go back to my car and text her and ask her to let me know when she does get there because I want to walk in with her. If it was not feasible for me to return to my car, I would wait in another inconspicuous place not go into the party and I would again text her and ask her to let me know when she gets there. I would feel out of place and also be a bit irritated while waiting for her. Because she asked me to be there, and I am doing her a favor, I would be a bit miffed at having to wait for her.",2.833333333
I am waiting outside the home and texting my friend to see if she is there yet. She replies no and that she is running late and will not be there for another 30 minutes. I don't want to sit in the car so I go to the door. I am greeted by the host with a smile. I mention that I am Sandy's friend and she is running late. I offer my hostess gift. She gladly lets me in and we make small talk. I grab a drink and some food and start to wander around the room looking for a friendly face to speak with.,3.916666667
"I think, if I were in this situation, I would probably not feel comfortable. I say this because I simply do not know anyone at the party and I am not familiar with the host. I would be upset with my friend, simply because she is not there and I would be worried about having to be there by myself. I would probably be calling her non stop to see where she is and get an estimated time of her arrival to the party. After a little while of doing this, I think that I would probably just give up and leave the party and go back home.",4.166666667
"I would feel very awkward, and would just try and make the best of it. I would probably find some people to mingle with and wait on my friend as close to the door as possible. I may leave if the friend did not show up soon. Not knowing people and showing up some place can be very awkward, but you can also make new friends if you try. I may walk around and go outside and smoke while I waited on my friend to show up. I would likely just call my friend on the phone and wait until she got there. Not knowing what else to do at that time.",2.416666667
I would wonder what happened to my friend. I would wonder if she got hurt and needed help. I would not be her friend if she wasn't the type of person that was this considerate. I would know that something was very wrong if she did not contact me. I would call her cellphone and if she did not respond I would leave a message. I would then contact someone close to her to try to also call. I hope that she would be fine and contact me right away so that I would feel better. It is a bad feeling to feel like someone is hurt and you cannot help them.,2.916666667
I would definitely head outside and sit in my car and try to reach my friend. I would seriously consider leaving the party. For sure I would leave if I could not reach my friend immediately. What better excuse could there be to get out of this situation which I never would have agreed to in the first place by the way. I hate social gatherings even when I know most of the people who are going to be there. I would not be likely to ever agree to the situation described here. It would be sheer torture for me.,2.666666667
I would feel slightly abandoned and very on edge. I would be looking around for anyone I may know at this party while getting my phone out to see if my friend has an ETA. While waiting I would look for some sort of food options to go and gather by and fill a plate or hand with some options so I don't look awkward. In my head I would be hoping someone comes to talk to me as in the situation I would be uncomfortable to approach someone else at the party. If I was waiting for a while or a couple of minutes really I would glue my eyes to my phone so I looked like I was waiting for someone and not in the wrong place.,2.666666667
I would be extremely annoyed with my friend and would probably bail on the party. I might go outside and try to figure out where they were and how long it would be before they got there. I mostly likely wouldn't stay at the party without my friend as it would just be awkward for everyone. If I did stay at the party I would probably just stay buried in my phone until my friend showed up and could make introductions. I'd be sure to let my friend know that I was not happy.,2.666666667
"Honestly, I wouldn't feel uncomfortable at all. I am a pretty sociable. During this time I would most likely grab a drink and then go ahead and mingle among the crowd to see if there is anyone I may remotely know. If not, I would look for others that might give off that I don't know many people here vibe and proceed to introduce myself to them. It's a good way to network and meet new people. I'd also probably text my friend and ask where his ass is, since he's late and I'm holding down the fort.",4.333333333
"In this situation I would feel very uncomfortable, like I am an unwelcome guest at a party, even though the invitation was extended to me through my friend. I would also feel a bit anxious and I would be wondering about my friend and her whereabouts. I would be worried that my friend is some sort of trouble that is making her late. While I waited for my friend in this situation I would try as best as I could to socialize with the other party guests and I would introduce myself to the host and to everyone else. I would also offer to help the host so that I can keep myself busy and so that I make myself look good in front of the host and the party guests.",1.333333333
"I would feel quite frustrated with my friend for being late but I would go ahead and introduce myself to the host and explain my friend that invited me is late. I would socialize and network while waiting for my friend. I would also try out the drinks and any snacks available and try to meet some people while waiting on my inconsiderate friend. I would try to make myself as comfortable as possible while waiting and enjoy the people, music, drinks and food while waiting If I got bored I would find somewhere to sit and play games on my phone as an absolute last resort. I would try to be as pleasant and sociable as possible.",2.583333333
"I would immediately feel like my friend might be blowing me off and not be attending the party after all. I would not want to go into the party without them, because I wouldn't really know anyone and would feel far too awkward to just go in without them. I'd be asking them for their estimated time of arrival and would be frequently checking my phone for messages from them and a the time. If I didn't hear from them, I would think of worst case scenarios that may have happened to them. I would also think that I was overreacting. I'd be pretty annoyed that they were late, because I was punctual and was really just showing up to the party to support them.",3.583333333
"I would think my friend is an asshole and may be I should just go in and tell everyone this. But my friend may also just be late of in a car wreck so in that case I will tell everyone I am with that person and she will show up eventually. In the meantime lets all tell stores about her, really off color ones. This will teach her to never be late too! I am even considering seriously making up a bunch of shit about her. Teach her to stand me up!",3.416666667
"I would feel a bit awkward, especially since this was an important party and likely involves people of a higher status than I, but I would most likely grab some snacks and find someone to talk to. I would look around for anyone else who wasn't already engaged in conversation, especially if they seemed a bit awkward and out of place, and approach with a friendly smile. I would ask how they knew the host, figure out what their connections to the party were hopefully as loose as mine are, and go from there to build a casual conversation until my friend arrives.",4.083333333
"I would be extremely nervous about arriving before my friend. I would wait in my car until he or she arrived. I would call or text my friend to let him or her know I was waiting in my car and ask him to let me know when he gets there. I absolutely would not, under any circumstance, go into the party without my friend. That would make me very uncomfortable. When my friend arrived, I would feel better about going into the party. I would probably give my friend grief about being late and making me wait too.",1.583333333
I think I will feel very stressed out because I need to wait outside and the party its beginning and the other persons become at the party and I need to wait until my friends come around and I think I will search in my cell phone while I need to wait in order to wait for my friend because its the only person that I know very well and I need to wait no matter what the time that it takes because I cannot come around the party because that's the condition to get inside.,3.5
"As is, I am extremely introverted, so there's a very high chance that I would not bother going inside until my friend showed up. I would probably walk back to my car, wherever I parked it, hop it and then attempt to call my friend to ask where they were and when they would be arriving. Then I would most likely either talk to them while they made their way to the party, or I would get off the phone and either listen to music on the radio or text other people until my friend actually showed up.",1.583333333
If this occurred to me I would make a strategic exit back outside and wait for my friend. If it was a party I drove to I would go back to my car and call my friend letting him know where I was located. I would probably sit in my car and listen to the radio. If I did not drive there I would hang out outside if at all possible. If this was not an option I would then do my best to strike up a conversation with someone in the room. I would look for someone similar to myself and proceed to try an find a common link.,2.5
"Upon entering the party, and realizing that my friend was late, I would locate the host to introduce myself and let them know that I was invited as a guest to my friend. I would probably then find myself a drink and maybe snacks. And try to mingle with others. I'm pretty good at talking, and I know I would feel awkward, but I think it would be more awkward to just stand against a wall and wait all alone. If I felt myself being extremely uncomfortable for some reason, I might find the bathroom and pretend I'm primping myself, etc.",3.75
"Knowing myself, I would look for the food and probably start talking to the most handsome guy at the party, out of nervousness or just because I like handsome guys LOL I would let people know that I am the punctual friend in the relationship and probably ask everyone's names and how they know my friend. I would want to know who the couples are, if anyone's boss is there and who manages who, if it was that type of event. Probably try to make people laugh. I would probably talk about my job a little, find out if I have any other mutual friends and what people's favorite music is, as well.",2.666666667
I would feel very anxious if my friend was late. This situation is very much outside of my comfort zone. Firstly I would be worried that something may be wrong with my friend. Secondly I would feel very stuck about how I should proceed. If I could contact my friend and get assurance that they would be arriving soon I would wait in my car until they arrived. If they didn't answer me I feel I would be very nervous about going into the party. In that even I may drive to my friends house to check on them instead of going to the party.,1.5
"if it happens means surely I feel very uncomfortable on that place, I try to come out from that place if it is not possible means I ask the staffs for the waiting room or some other quite places in the hall to keep me alone, I ask my friend for the exact time of his presence there, based on that I will choose the options like whether stay the room or to left from that place, in case he say he need more time means surely I shouted to him.",3.833333333
"I would be very upset with my friend for not being at the party at the set time and for not calling or texting ahead to let me know. I would not do that to someone and it is so easy these days to text people if you are going to be late that I would feel disrespected. I would definitely text the friend and see if they were ok before getting too upset but, that said, I would also be sure to let them know how I felt if there weren't a good reason for being late and for not texting me in advance that they would be late to the very party they invited me to!",3.25
"I would feel comfortable in this situation. I would text my friend, and see if he was ok with me going into the party before he arrives. Assuming that he has no problem with it, I would enter the party and start mingling with the other quests. Since I don't know these people very well, I would engage in light small talk, and explain my situation to anyone who asked why I was there. It's a party, everyone is supposed to have a good time, so I wouldn't feel out of place in this environment.",3.083333333
I would be a little upset at first but I would quickly grab myself a drink and start scanning the party looking for interesting people to talk to. I would find a group or a person that looked friendly and explain my situation and probably make a few jokes about my friend ditching me or that I am just there for the free food or drinks. I would try to make the best of the situation and hopefully I would meet a new friend. I would probably introduce myself to several people in order to find the most interesting or the one I have the most in common with in order to keep myself occupied until my friend arrives.,4.5
I would feel very uncomfortable in that situation. I would probably talk to the host for a very few moments and then decide to go and wait for my friend in my car. If I had to wait too long I would probably get frustrated and drive away. I would be angry at my friend for convincing me to show up at a party where I didn't really know anyone. I would be unhappy at myself for not being able to be a person who is outgoing and makes friends easily.,1.583333333
"I would be disappointed that my friend is not there. I would get a drink and then see if I recognized anyone. I would then employ my networking skills. I would see if there is anyone there who appears to be by themselves and try to spark up a conversation with them. It would nt be hard since a party is usually a good time to try out some new things to talk about. I would feel better about myself if someone would return my desire to make small talk. If unsuccessful, I would then find the nearest TV and watch it until my friend arrived.",3.833333333
"Knowing that my friend knows how much I hate social engagements. I would feel pretty bad sitting there waiting. I would not wait very long, I would probably disengage from the place I am not familiar, and honestly do not want to be, and try to get him to meet me elsewhere. The person that asked me is the type of guy to get there early, so I would make sure he is safe, but I would probably leave if I had to wait for more then 10 minutes in a place, I did not want to be in the first place.",2.75
I would feel a little bit uncomfortable and disappointed at the fact that my friend had not shown up yet. What I would try and do is maybe get familiar with the area and keep an eye on the people to see if there was anyone I would be interested in speaking to. I might also consider going ahead and getting A drink in order to lighten the mood a little bit while I waited for them to show up. If I did I hear for them for a little bit I would go ahead and reach out to them just to make sure everything's all right on their end and that they are just simply running late.,3.416666667
"I would try to busy myself by working-class on phone or doing my office work on my laptop, if I fail to concentrate then I would pass time by talking over phone or discuss any important issue about my work with my colleague. If no one is available then I would like try to go to meet new people and try to mix without them, otherwise I could watch a movie on my own phone until my friend arrives. I can take Some snacks or watch the party or enjoy the party by dancing or doing something that can be entertaining.",3.833333333
"I WOULD BE VERY UNCOMFORABLE IN THIS SITUATION. PRIOR TO GOING INSIDE, IF I KNEW MY FRIEND HADNT ARRIVED I WOULD WAIT IN MY CAR AND TRY CALLING TO SEE WHERE SHE IS. IF I WAS ALREADY INSIDE I WOULD TRY TO FIND A SEAT IN A OUT OF THE WAY LOCATION AND CALL HER TO SEE WHERE SHE IS AND HOW LONG SHE WILL BE. I MIGHT SEE IF THERE IS ANYONE THERE THAT I FEEL COMFORTABLE STARTING A CONVERSATION WITH WHILE I WAIT FOR MY FRIEND. I WOULD KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON THE DOOR AND IMPATIENTLY AWAIT THE ARRIVAL OF MY FRIEND SO I WOULD HAVE SOMEONE TO TALK TO THAT I WAS FAMILIAR WITH.",2.25
I would wait for my friend outside for a few minutes and keep trying to contact her if she is still coming in the off the chance that she decided not to. I would keep waiting and go inside to talk to the host about the relationship with my friend and ask if she contacted them. I would gauge the level of their relationship to see if I should keep waiting inside or out. I would feel uncomfortable to be waiting in a party where I don't know anybody at all.,3.75
"I would text my friend and let them know I have joined the party. I walk in as if I own the place, and do what I normally do, make a few friends whom introduce me to others at the party. My friend shows up 30 minutes later, by that time, I realize a few people I am talking to and I have much in common, so my friend's late arrival is no concern to me anymore. After a few hours, my new friends and I decide to meet at the local Waffle House and continue our conversation until the wee hours of the next morning.",5
"It is a little difficult because the situation could be different. But the most logical behavior would be to find somebody nearby and introduce myself. I could ask the person whether they know my friend, who is the host of the party, what is expected to happen. Then I maybe would help myself at the table. If somebody would try to start conversation with me, I would politely reply. Again, I would mention my friend's name saying that I was invited by my friend. It may build some relationship. I would try to listen carefully everything I've told to expand the conversation while I am waiting for my friend.",4.25
I would call my friend and try to find out where they are and how long it will take them to get there. I would feel uncomfortable that I am there without anyone I would know. I would introduce myself briefly to the host and explain who I am and let them know my friend is on their way. I would then try to stay out of the way without being too awkward because I don't want to seem like someone who crashed the party. I would be friendly if someone approached me but wouldn't try to intrude on anyone's conversations.,2.75
"So if I got to a party before my friend arrived it would be no problem. I am very outgoing and have no problem starting conversations with new strangers. I would start by introducing myself and telling them my friend invited me to the party but was not there yet. So I would then begin going around the crowd and talking and telling them about my job and ask what they do for a living. I would tell them about my family and ask them also about theirs. I would ask them what are their hobbies and other interests. So before my friend arrives, I will probably know most of the people there already.",5
I would feel very anxious since I didn't know anyone. I would look around to try to find somebody that was relatable to a topic that I could relate to them with. Depending on how long it would be until my friend would be there I would potential he go out to my car and wait for them to show up. I will also walk around the party and just make observations of people and other things that were going on at that moment. It would be too hard to make some small talk until my friend did eventually show up. However that would not be my first full of activities.,2.5
I would be upset my friend is late. I'd wait outside and call them to see how long they will be. If not long I would wait outside. If they will take an extremely long I would go inside and try to befriend any lonely looking people to keep company until my friend arrive and I'd keep my phone in my hand so I can see the call come in. If they take too long I'd just leave and go back home and be mad at my friend for having me show up.,4.666666667
"If I was early to the party I would feel awkward and would immediately text or call my friend. Since I wouldn't know anyone at the party it would be weird. Depending on the time my friend said she would arrive I may wait outside or just enter the party since waiting outside to long would appear even weirder. However if I went inside to the party I would most likely go straight to the liquor to chill my nerves and begin making small chat with others. Since, I don't know anyone I might as well put myself out there anyway.",3
"I would try to start a conversation with someone who was at the party, preferably someone who was without someone to talk to just like me, I would ask if that person knows my friend and talk about current issues like sports, weather and some recent event. If I can't find someone to start a conversation with, I would be sitting somewhere fiddling with my cell phone and hiding the boredom I would surely be experiencing in this unpleasant situation until my friend arrived. If my friend takes more than 1 hour I would sneak out and leave.",2.333333333
"I would never go into the party by myself, even if I knew people at the party. I would sit in my car and listen to music or browse on my phone. I would probably be nervously smoking cigarette after cigarette as well as it's just a common nervous habit of mine when I'm anxious or uncomfortable. I would try to call my friend that I was supposed to me and if I couldn't get a hold of them I would just leave and go home for the night. If that did happen I would be upset with my friend and probably would never agree to go out with them again.",1.166666667
I would feel very uncomfortable that my friend was late. I would be waiting outside for my friend since I don't know the people attending the party or the host of the party. I would patiently continue waiting outside or in my car for my friends arrival to the party. As the time passed though I would try calling or texting my friend to see is something happened to them to make them late. I would confirm the time with my watch and also my cell phone just in case one or the other was running a bit fast. I would stay out of sight of any people that were attending the party just in case they thought that I was an intruder to the party.,4.166666667
"I would love to check out the party, so I think I will go ahead and see what's going on. To meet people, I would make up some icebreakers, approach with a friendly smile, and talk to people. It would be a fun time. I wouldn't wait for my friend if he was that late. But I would keep an eye out for him. It would be fun to go and mingle for a bit without a friend, and just venture out on my own. Seems like this would be a great part and if it was an important one, my friend will definitely get here and help introduce me to people there.",4.25
"I would feel very isolated. I don't like making new friends, and I don't make friends quickly. It would be a room full of strangers. Very scary for me. I would likely find a seat in an out-of-the way place and watch people mill about. If someone came up to me, I might start a conversation based on how I was feeling. If I was feeling good, I would get to know the persona and ask some basic questions. If I felt bad, I would try to brush them off and keep to myself. I would also message my friend to find out when my friend would come.",1.166666667
"I would probably be really stressed out. If I realized she was late before I went to the party, I would probably wait in the car. I've had trouble getting myself to get out of the car and go into social events when I know everyone there. Without the person that I know, I'd probably be panicked. If I was already inside, I might try to find someone else that looked shy and introduce myself. Otherwise, I'd probably be hovering around the food and trying to not attract attention until my friend got there. It would be really hard for me and I'd probably cry when I got back to my car.",1.333333333
"I would feel very anxious mainly because my friend is not there. My first thought would be to find out if something happened to my friend. For example, I hope they were not involved in a car accident on the way to the party or that something else may have happened. Not knowing anyone would be a bit scary but I think I would be able to meet some of the people there and introduce myself to help make things not quite as awkward for myself or other people at the party. I would certainly keep an eye on the door to watch for my friend to arrive or at least check my phone to see if I have any call or text messages from them.",4.416666667
"It would certainly feel awkward to me to be at a party where I know nobody. I will try calling my friend to find out what time he would be arriving, so that I would get an idea of how much time I would need to wait. If it is a short wait, I would just gaze around and play a game on my phone. If it is a rather long wait, I might leave the location and take a trip to a nearby food joint and have a meal until my friend arrives. Then we would both go to the event.",2.833333333
"I would call or text my friend to see why they are late. I do not like being around people that I do not know, so I would be very uncomfortable. I would find something to drink and go outside and find somewhere to sit by myself. If my friend does not show up within the next 10 minutes and will find the host and let them know that I am leaving and to please let my friend know that I am going home. I would be upset because my friend would know that I do not like being in these kinds of situations.",1.25
"I would introduce myself to some people and mingle while I waited for my friend. I would be a little bit peeved, as I am scrupulously punctual and my friends know this about me and at the very least there should have been a phone call or a text to let me know that they were running late. I would send the obligatory where you at? Text, then grab a drink and introduce myself to the most fun looking people there. When my friend arrived, I would detach myself from those I was mingling with and go to my friend and find out what was up.",5
"Not being familiar with the crowd of people attending the party and my friend who invited me was late, I think I would feel really. I would probably leave or wait outside for my friend till he or she arrived. I would only wait for about 30 minutes the most. If he or she still hasn't arrived I would try to contact the friend who extended the invitation and let them know that I was going to go home. I am not really comfortable going into situations where I am not familiar with the situation or the other people involved.",2
I would feel fairly awkward at first since I do not know anyone there and a bit let down that my friend was late. I would introduce myself to the host of the party and thank them for the invite. I would have some small talk with them and thank them for allowing me to attend. I would then check out the snack and drink situation. I would get a drink and get a little food to hold me over if available. I would survey what was happening at the party and look to find some common areas of interest with other guests and start some conversation while I am waiting.,4.25
"I would probably wait in my car as long as I possibly could hoping that my friend would arrive. Honestly, if I didn't know anyone I would not enter without my friend. I would wait, and try to contact my friend. I would probably just play games or surf the internet on my phone while I wait. If I could not contact my friend, I would wait for a reasonable amount of time, and if they did not arrive, I would just leave. If my friend lets me know when they would arrive, depending on the time, I might go somewhere close to kill time while waiting.",2.5
"I would feel very uncomfortable. I would likely still go to the party and introduce myself to the host. I would likely keep to my self and maybe make a plate of food or have a drink to bind my time. I would also seek out any other people that I have met or know so that I could have some small talk. I would also likely play on my phone, step out and make a call, etc so I wouldn't be alone. I would keep asking my friend her time of arrival so I could make sure she was coming eventually.",2.916666667
"I would feel awkward about going in to the party prior to my friend's arrival. Assuming that I had driven myself to the party, I'd likely check in with my friend before I went to the host's door. At that point, I would choose to wait in my car until my friend arrived so that we could go inside together. If that weren't a possibility if I had gone to the door before realizing that my friend hadn't arrived yet I would make the best of the situation. I'd feel a little uncomfortable going to an event like this when I don't know anyone and wasn't personally invited. But, I'd introduce myself to the host and explain the situation. I would simply be polite, make small talk, and try to casually meet few people while waiting for my friend to arrive.",3.75
I'd feel pretty apprehensive about going to the party in the first place but now that my friend was running late- it would make me feel pretty uptight. I'd have a difficult time starting up conversations with people- I like having someone by my side to help guide me in these social situations. I'd be a little frustrated that they were running late considering that we had planned on 9 PM. My nerves of being at a party and not knowing anyone would take over though and I'd be more anxious. I'd keep looking at the door and at my phone hoping for some kind of contact. I hope my friend will arrive soon- this is uncomfortable for me to be at this party!,2
"IF I WAS IN THIS SITUATION I WOULD WAIT FOR MY FRIEND TO ARRIVE TOT HE PARTY BEFORE I GET OUT THE CAR. I WOULD USE THE EXTRA TIME TO CHARGE MY PHONE, TOUCH UP MY MAKEUP, TAKE SELFIES AND OTHER THINGS WHILE I WAIT. MOST LIKELY I WOULD ALSO CONFIRM WITH MY FRIEND HOW FAR AWAY SHE IS SO I KNOW HOW MUCH TIME I HAVE TO SPARE. I WOULDN'T FEEL ANY WAY TOWARDS MY FRIEND BECAUSE I AM OFTEN LATE TO EVENTS AND I WOULD EXPECT MY FRIENDS NOT TO BE MAD WHEN I AM LATE.",3.333333333
"I would be nervous about it. I am socially anxious in gatherings like this. I would feel anxious, and I would be calling or texting my friend to see where they were or if they were still coming. I would probably sit in my car outside and wait until I heard from them or saw them show up. I would definitely not want to go into the party alone with strangers I don't know. I would be a chicken and wait for my friend that talked me into going with them. I might wish I didn't say I'd go or that I stayed home also.",1.916666667
"I would be really reluctant to go to this party or to every put myself in this situation. This would be super awkward. I would never feel comfortable in this situation. To be honest, it sounds excruciatingly uncomfortable and I would hate to experience this. I would feel really awkward. I would probably excuse myself from the party, after apologizing to the host and the other guests. I would either call my friend and wait outside for them to arrive, or else I would leave the party all together and just go home.",1.833333333
"First, I would feel pretty awkward and nervous. I have been in a situation like this before where I showed up before my friend and I felt really out of place. I might think about going out to hang out in my car for a little while until I see my friend get there. If I couldn't do this, I might just scroll on my phone and entertain myself until my friend got there. I might even just pretend to entertain myself on my phone. Overall, it's a pretty awkward situation and causes a lot of anxiety for me.",3.083333333
I would feel very nervous and angry that my friend wasn't on time. I would go outside and call my friend and see what is taking her so long to get there and I would then probably go back inside and find one of the pets of the person who was giving the party and play with them or maybe see if anybody takes the initiative to come up to me and start talking to me. I doubt I would go up to anyone and start a conversation with anyone as I would probably be too nervous to do that.,2
"I would be very nervous and somewhat irritated that my friend had not shown up at the party on time. I would try to introduce myself to the host and some of the others while I am waiting on my friend. I think that since, I do not know many people that conversation would be somewhat hard to maintain. I would find me a small out of the way place to blend in. I would probably just sit or stand with a drink in my hand, and I would watch for my friend and only talk when someone else strikes up a conversation.",4.5
I would feel very annoyed at my friend. I would feel that I went out of my way to do something for them then they did not even bother be on time. I would also feel out of place because I most likely do not know anyone there. I would feel foolish for not making sure that my friend was going to be there before me. I would awkwardly introduce myself and be put off by the whole situation. When my friend got there I would probably not try very hard to mingle with people.,2.333333333
"If I arrived at the party and realized my friend hadn't yet arrived, I'd introduce myself to the first available person and explain I've been invited by my friend namewho hasn't yet arrived. Depending on that person's reaction, I'd then move into social chit-chat and hopefully meet the host. Meanwhile, I'd feel it would've been easier if my friend were already at the party and that it was my friend who was helping me navigate through the party scene, but I would realize that I just had to do the best I could on my own.",3.166666667
I would feel pretty frustrated as I put timeliness at the top of my priorities. I would try and find someone who is alone as well and try to start a conversation with them introduce myself as the friend of the person that was invited. I would try to suss out who my friend is to these people while trying to forge my own identity in this new clique. Once I had properly introduced myself around and gathered a rapport with the crowd I would start eating their food.,3.333333333
"I would feel some shyness for the people who are there since they are unknown to me, maybe I have never introduced myself to someone, but while my friend has not arrived maybe in the wait I take the initiative to introduce myself to some of the guests to give me to meet, although perhaps it would be uncomfortable for me since I was not invited directly. I would try to approach the host and be grateful to be there as well as express my disposition to any matter that requires.",3.916666667
I would feel rather annoyed with my friend and question the fact why we didn't attend the party together. I would trying calling or texting my friend to see where they are in they still plan on attending the party. If I get no response within 10 minutes then I would leave and go elsewhere. I would be upset with my friend for not keeping posted on the decision to not attend. Not to mention wasting my time and making me feel uncomfortable at a location where I do not know anyone.,1.583333333
"I would feel a little upset that my friend had wanted me to go so badly and now was showing up late. I would be a little annoyed. I might get a bite to eat while I waited, maybe play a game on my phone, and check my social media. If my friend was not there withing 30 minutes I would leave and go home. I would not wait on my friend any more than that unless they had texted or called me to let me know that they were going to be late and how late they would be. Otherwise, I would wait in the car after I'm done.",2.916666667
"I would try to find something to drink and hang out around that area. I'd definitely see if there was a cat or dog running around that I could pet and play with. I might try to strike up conversations with some of the people there, general chit-chat. I'd feel extremely uncomfortable at first. I would be impatient with my friend and probably be texting her about her arrival time. I might go to the bathroom and look at my phone to kill time before she arrives. I would ask around about my friend to strike up conversations about her.",2.166666667
"I will feel awkward of course, because it would be really hard for me to start a conversation without knowing anyone. I will also feel disappointed because my friend knew that I did not know anyone, so he or she should be here first. When I am waiting for my friend, I would try to go around and familiarize myself. I will also try to listen to other people's conversations and try to figure out what they like to talk about and maybe jump into the conversation. Of course I would be trying to contact my friend too regarding the situation.",3.5
"First of all, I would feel tired. I don't stay up that late very often. Then I would panic because I am very shy and would not want to be alone. I would probably go outside and wait for my friend. I would probably find a place to sit, maybe in my car, and entertain myself with my phone. I would get on Facebook or I would do surveys until my friend showed up. If my friend was still not there after waiting for an hour or so, I would go ahead and drive myself home. I would text my friend and go to bed.",2.833333333
"If I was there before my friend because he was late, and I was around people I didn't know, I will try to strike up some conversations with some new people, and make some new friends. I love to meet new people, and to see if we have things in common, I would definitely see this as an opportunity to the make some new friends, and be able to share some of my interests with them. The situation might make some people a little anxious, but not me. I would see it as a fun opportunity.",4.333333333
"I would feel nervous, I would feel like a stranger, and I would be worried that if my friend would not come at all. I would try to talk to people, I would try to make friends, I would try to fit in. And if I cannot fit in, I would grab a drink, I would just check my phone to kill time. I would read some news on the phone. I would count the time when my friend would finally show up. I would feel the time go really slow. I would feel that I made a mistake to come.",3.416666667
"I would definitely be upset. First off, we would have came together. I don't trust others to be there on time. I would definitely be upset. I would hope my friend would call and let me know. While I am waiting for my friend, I would look around to see if anyone looked familiar. If not, I would try to find a seat, get a drink and wait at least 15 minutes for my friend. If my friend does not arrive within that time frame, I would leave. I may try to mingle if I am approached but I would definitely be out of my comfort zone for sure.",2.75
"So I arrive and my friend was not there as schedule. I will not feel weird at all so I will go to the bar and maybe try to talk to some folks to see what is up. I would just wait for my friend to arrive. After all, even though I do not like to talk to people and be the center of attention, I have no issues approaching folks and start a conversation. I will just introduce myself and tell them that my date is late in a joking matter and just try to get to know the crowd.",3.5
"I hate waiting, period. Idk why it just bugs me. Even waiting in a drive thru irritates me. So I would be irritated that I'm waiting yet again. I wouldn't feel negatively towards my friend at all thought. Being late happens. I'll just over dramatically be fake annoyed and then I'd just snap out of it and play some games on my phone. OOOO before that I would definitely call them and text them a few times. If my friend takes too long I'll just enter the party myself and introduce myself as blank's friend. Not knowing the host or crowd doesn't bother me. I'm a people's person, especially to strangers.",4.75
"If my friend was late to this party, I would feel anxious as well as feeling a bit miffed. However, I would try to make the best of the situation and I would try to be sociable with the new people that I would meet at the party. I would not want to appear timid or anti-social, so I try to strike up conversations with a variety of folks at the party. I would try to find something in common with some of these people and I would try to build a conversation with these folks around any commonality I may find.",4.333333333
"In reality there is a 0 percent chance I would have ever agreed to this as I do not go to any type of party for any reason. But. I while waiting for my late friend, I would attempt to locate the food, assuming there is some, Most parties have food right? Idk, they do in movies. I would then eat in the corner until my fried showed up. If there was no food I would take this as a sign that I could just leave, and go get some food elsewhere. Basically as soon as I think about food, my natural, despise party nature would kick in. Also its 9 pm and I don't do anything past 8 pm. Also what even is an important party?",1.583333333
"I will feel very awkward. I will pull a chair corner of the party and will have a drink. Open my mobile, silently I will watch some videos and enjoy watching. I will not mingle with anybody. As if I am a new guest, I will just sit away from party. Anybody asked, I will tell, my friend is on the way and I will be joining shortly. I will confirm with her, how long will it take, if very much long taken, I will move out from there, without informing anyone. I will feel very awkward. I will pull a chair corner of the party and will have a drink. Open my mobile, silently I will watch some videos and enjoy watching. I will not mingle with anybody. As if I am a new guest, I will just sit away from party. Anybody asked, I will tell, my friend is on the way and I will be joining shortly. I will confirm with her, how long will it take, if very much long taken, I will move out from there, without informing anyone.",3.666666667
"If I were in this situation, I would immediately feel quite uneasy since I do not care for social gatherings. I tend to be very uneasy in social gatherings and I am very self-conscious. Nonetheless, since my friend has not arrived, I would likely just stay to myself unless someone approached me or if there was an opportunity to say hello. If there were any food or drinks, I might have a drink and move around the room just to kill time while waiting for my friend. When I am in this type of situation, I honestly look for the first opportunity to leave. I guess you could say I have social anxiety and panic. So, I would be watching the clock, almost hoping that my friend doesn't show up soon so I would have an excuse to just slip out the door and go home. I could then tell my friend that I waited for them, but when they didn't arrive, I left because I didn't know anyone.",2
"I would be annoyed, but would try to make the best of it. I understand that people are sometimes late, and even though I don't know people well, there has to be someone at this party that I can talk to until my friend arrives. I might even try to befriend the host, because then I could offer them help if they needed it, which would keep me busy. I would try to be understanding of my friend being late, but if they were going to be later than about a half hour without good reason, I probably wouldn't stay.",3.416666667
I would feel out of place. I would first call my friend and see about how long until they arrive. I would see if they could contact the host of the party to let them know that I was there and to come and check on me to make me feel comfortable. I would get a drink if possible and just walk around anxiously awaiting my friend to get there. I would probably keep my face in my phone and maybe try to find a place to sit and relax until my friend arrives.,2.166666667
I would feel a little awkward and start to wonder how long it will be before my friend shows up. Since my friend is not there and no one knows me I would try to find the host and introduce myself. Then I would just start chatting with some of the other people at the party. It is a good way to get to know new people and I do not need my friend to be there to talk to people that I do not know. After a while if my friend did not show I would call them to make sure everything is okay.,4.416666667
"I would feel highly uncomfortable. I would attempt to contact my friend to find out what the problem is. If I do not get an answer, I will attempt two more times while inside waiting. If the attempts are failed attempts, I will politely excuse myself and exit the party. Then, I will wait for my friend for twenty more minutes. If my friend does not show up, I will send my friend a long text message telling he or she that his or her behavior is very unacceptable. I would leave and continue to find other things to do.",3.083333333
"I would feel upset that they knew I wasn't super excited about coming to this party and then they weren't obligated enough to show up on time. They would know how not excited I originally was because I would have communicated that too them, so I would be upset with them. While I waited for my friend, I would just hang out in my car on my phone until they arrived. I would be texting them constantly in order to know what their ETA was and I would ensure that I would not go into the party until they were there.",2.333333333
"I would feel ill at ease, not knowing anyone. I would introduce myself to the hosts and probably make small talk for a while, hating every moment of it. After I'd exhausted the small talk, I'd kill more time by going to the restroom and fixing my makeup. I'd probably hang out in there texting my other friends and I'd likely text my friend who was late to find out their ETA. If they were running really late, I might temporarily leave the party under the pretext of having to make an emergency phone call. I'd return when my friend arrived.",2.25
I would call my friend after waiting for a few minutes to see how far out they are. I would then let them know where I'm parked and inform them I'm going to wait in my car until they arrive. I would hang up and be very annoyed that they are running late. I would then call my wife and let her know how annoyed I am and talk to her for a while. I'd then play games on my phone and surf the Internet until my friend showed up. I would also play around on social media. Mostly just scrolling through other people's posts.,2.083333333
This is always a most uneasy situation. I would look around to see if I actually knew any of the people at the party. I would ask who the host was and introduce myself to him or her telling them who had invited me and that he or she will probably be along shortly. Then I would call my friend who had invited me and find out where they are and how late they will be. After that I would get a drink or something to eat and start to blend in with the crowd making small talk with others. Hopefully my friend will arrive soon because I am not really adept at talking to strangers.,3.333333333
I would get a drink and nurse it slowly hoping someone interesting would start a conversation but I would not go looking for one. I would check my phone to see if my friend had texted me when they would arrive and I would start an internal count down to when they would be arriving. I would be extremely mad because if they are my friend they no I do not like this and I always arrive on time or early. I would be a little bit more upset because they talked me into going. I would try to appear undisturbed but I'm not very good at that so I would probably not be putting off a friendly vibe even though it would be better if I did and I know that but I am just me.,2
"I would immediately feel anxious, and irritated with my friend for not showing up on time. I'd probably grab a drink to make myself feel a bit more comfortable. Then I'd try to find a few friendly faces and go over to introduce myself. I'd text my friend to find out when they planned to arrive. If I felt comfortable talking with the new people I met, I would hang around at the party until my friend arrived. If there was no one there who was friendly and welcoming, I would probably leave and go home. I hate that awkward feeling of not knowing anyone! Oh, I forgot about pets. If I feel uncomfortable at a party, I do a quick search for a dog or cat. It's a nice way to avoid being fake friendly to people I don't know.",3
"First of all, I would either text or call my friend to see if they are okay or if they are ill or have been involved in an accident. If they are just running late, I would ask my friend what time they are anticipating being at the party. If it will be an extended amount of time, I would ask them to call the host and let the host know my name and I am a guest that they invited to the party. I would then introduce myself to the host, since they would then know I am not a party crasher. I probably would be a little perturbed by my friend's lateness, but I would try to not let it show in my favorite. I would then survey the room to see if there was anyone I know that I could go have conversation with. If I see an acquaintance, I would go over and chat with them. If not, I would go get myself and drink and find a place to stand or sit until my friend arrives at the party.",2.5
"I would be anxious, there is no denying that. Since I don't know anyone I might hang around in a corner for a bit, trying to contact my friend to see if they were on their way. If refreshments were being served I might head over to that area and mingle a little with those standing by the table, and try not to appear so awkward. If asked who I was I would say I am the guest of my friend, who apparently is running a bit late. And I would laugh nervously and try to make conversation with people and act friendly and approachable.",3
"I actually probably wouldn't have even gone in the party until I knew with certainty that my friend was there. Regardless I would be very upset my friend was late. I would probably leave the party and wait for my friend in my car. I don't like situations where I don't know people, and I especially don't like parties where its expected for everyone to be social. I also don't drink and would feel that pressure so I generally stay away from parties. I feel like my friend should know this about me so that what would be most disappointing.",1.333333333
I would just go into the party and blend in. I would start talking to people and getting acquainted with the people. I would start drinking and parting. I would want to find a good looking young lady to spend some time with. When I meet here I would make her the center of my attention. Once I got her on the line I would invite her to leave with me and go back to my place where we could have a party of our own. We would have a great time and it would be a wonderful evening. It would be the time of our lives.,3.75
I'd feel upset with my friend. I'm sure I'd be texting their phone and trying to find out why they are not there even though we made plans. I'd also be working it up in my head that there was a terrible accident and that is why they aren't here. I don't do well when people aren't where they say they'll be when they say they'll be there. I go to worst case scenario that they are dead in a ditch somewhere. I'm sure I'd be pacing back and forth and looking to the door for their arrival.,2.5
"I would feel somewhat awkward at first. I would check and see if I could get into contact with my friend first. I might look at my phone for a while. After some time I would introduce myself to some of the people at the party. I would joke about the situation and admit that I was nervous. After some time of talking to people, I would probably be less nervous. It would depend on the other people at the party. There would be the chance that I did not get along with the people there. If that was the case, I would message my friend and tell them that I was leaving and leave the party.",2.5
"I would feel very anxious. I would likely leave the party and text my friend from the car, asking where they are. I would be irritated with my friend for not showing up. I would probably wait in the car for them to arrive and refuse to reenter the party until they arrived. I would not feel comfortable being in the party with people I do not know. I would feel like an outsider since I do not know the host, either. I would be alert and anxious and looking over the parking lot, trying to find my friend. Once my friend arrives, I will then go in.",1.833333333
I would hate to go to a party to begin with then when I get there to not find my friend there would make me highly uncomfortable and upset because having my friend there would be a source of comfort for me. I think that maybe it would be better if my friend and I ride together to the party so we could arrive and leave together for further avoid any awkward situations. Since I have arrived alone though I will greet the host and get something to drink then try to find a spot to sit out of the way.,1.5
I would first feel very anxious. I would want to make sure that my friend is doing ok. I would first try to send a text message to my friend and maybe call them. After a certain amount of time that has passed I would also begin to reach out to other people that may know where they are. Finally to keep myself occupied I would play games and listen to a lot of different music. I would want to keep myself calm for the most part and try not to panic too much.,2.75
"If my friend asked me to attend a party in which the I have not met the host and are not very familiar with the crowd of people who will attend the party. And my friend is running late. I would feel very awkward about it since I don't anyone from the party. I'll probably be stepping outside until my friend arrives at the party. It would be okay if I met already the host even if I don't know much of the people in the party. I will call my friend to find out where he is, if he is almost near the place of the party.",3.416666667
I would feel horrified. I do not like being around strangers that I know nothing about. If I was already at the party I would probably try to find a quiet place to sit and wait for my friend. If I hadn't actually entered the party yet I would wait outside until my friend arrived. I would also call my friend and make sure that everything is ok with them. I would feel very nervous because I am an introvert and am very nervous around people in general. Even more so if I don't know the people very well.,1.75
"I would try to wait outside until my friend came if at all possible. I would feel quite uncomfortable and nervous while waiting since I am somewhat shy. If I was forced to go in like if I was seen or it was bitterly cold, I would introduce myself to the host. I would kind of stay to the side until my friend came. I would text my friend to see when they would be coming. I would probably play on my phone or go over my calendar to help pass the time and to distract myself from feeling uncomfortable. I would be happy when my friend shows up.",3.5
"I would wait in my vehicle until I could get a hold of my friend. If she was going to be much later, I would leave and run some errands and then come back and wait in my car. If she was going to be ridiculously late, I would tell her that she's on her own and I'm done waiting for her. I would make sure she was okay first and find out why she was late. If she was just being irresponsible I would definitely tell her that I'm not happy.",2.583333333
"It I was asked by my friend to attend a party where I didn't know the group of people and I wasn't familiar with the host then I showed up and I realized my friend was not there yet, I would start feeling uptight. I would be nervous and I would take out my phone and play with it while I waited on my friend to arrive at the party. I would make any necessary phone calls that I needed to make. I would text people just to look busy and not nervous.",1
"I would try to be sociable and talk to as many people as I could to try and fit in with the crowd as I wait for my friend to arrive. The important thing to me would be not looking like I do not belong at the party. Although I am unfamiliar with the host or many people there, it would be important for me to fit in with everyone there and not hurt anyone's feelings. I would want my friend to be happy to arrive and see me there. Being there to support my friend is a very important consideration in the process.",3.666666667
"Easy. I would sit in my car and wait. I am VERY antisocial and I have high anxiety around people, especially those I do not know well or at all. So, I would stay in my car and call my friend to ask where she is and when she will be there. Then I would wait in the car and play with my phone or something. Maybe it's weird but here's the thing about that: I don't care! When I do go in the party house I'll be just as antisocial anyway and either sit by myself or cling to my friend all night so it's not much different than sitting by myself in my car for a while. I don't care what they think of me anyway. I'll probably never see most of them again in my life.",1.083333333
"I hate parties, I hate going out late. 9 pm is when I am usually in bed. None of my friends would ask me to attend such a party or expect me to stay up late. Friends do not make unreasonable demands of others. If I was there at 9;00 pm and my friend was not, I would wait a very short amount of time, no more than 5 minutes and then leave I would have driven my own car to this party specifically so I could leave when I was ready and not need to wait on anyone else. If my friend showed up within the period I was waiting, I would point out to them that they were late. I would walk in with them only long enough to say hi. I would sneak back out at the first opportunity and leave by myself as described above.",2.166666667
"As I arrive at this important party, I look around to see where my friend is. Of course she's running late, so I'm going to move around in this crowded room and find someone to talk to. I don't really worry that I'm by myself since I've been in situation before. I don't have a problem talking to strangers, so I look over and see a couple of people standing against the wall. I approach one of them, introduce myself, and make a little conversation. I know that if this person doesn't seem interested in talking, I will move on to the next person. I''ll also follow people to the refreshments and act like I belong there.",4
"When I first find out she isn't there yet, I'm going to be a little perturbed, but I will remind myself that she felt comfortable enough with me going so I shouldn't be so worried about it. I will text her to tell her I am there, and then I will probably buy myself a few minutes and find a restroom to do something, even if it's just to check my hair and makeup in the mirror. I'm now going to feel like I'm there as her representative until she arrives, so I'll go where most everyone is, and stand in one spot and look around smiling while holding my phone as if I've got some important thing going on and to give the impression that I'm not just standing there with nothing to do like a weirdo.",3.083333333
"I would feel very uncomfortable and would probably not walk in. The first thing I would do is text my friend to find out how long she was going to be. If she was 20 minutes or so out, I would probably drive away from the party and head over to a coffee shop or local diner. At that point I would catch up on email, texts or anything else that I need to do. I would also tell my friend to text me when she was at the party. If my friend was close to the party and I really did not have to wait for long, I would just wait in my car. While I was waiting I would do the same thing I mentioned above- check email. Texts, etc.",2.333333333
"Well first of all, I would never agree to go to a party at 9 PM as that is way too late. If I did however, I guess I would feel pretty awkward. If I noticed before going in I would just wait outside in my car until the friend I know arrived. If I didn't realize until I was inside, I would introduce myself to the folks I saw, especially the ones who answered the door and take it from there. I have a pretty good way of seeming comfortable when I'm really not, and a whole book of stories and meaningless things to talk about as small talk that may or may not have actually happened in my life.",2
"I would feel incredibly awkward. I would probably wander around the party, hoping that I would somehow know somebody else that was there that I could talk to. If I saw no familiar faces, I would probably wait outside for my friend. I guess it's really dependent on what kind of party it was and the type of people that were there. For some parties it would be strange to go inside, walk a lap then walk back outside. If the party is important to my friend I wouldn't want to mess anything up for them. If I felt that remaining at the party was important, I would hope for a situation where I could gracefully enter a conversation or start one.",2.583333333
"I would feel depressed, as all the persons there were unknown to me, and I would be just wandering here and there in the party, sometimes looking others how they are behaving, talking, performing, sometimes having food, sometimes operating phone, capturing party video, and then also if friend not comes, then I would sit anywhere basically at back side to see any live performance if it is going on stage, and would keep on waiting the friend and calling him or her to reach early. It may be possible I call somebody over phone to do time pass.",2.5
"I would wait in my car and call my friend until they show up. I am unfamilar with the host and do not know anyone else, so I would not go it or talk to anyone. I would feel bad that my friend is late and I might not trust them or go to something like this with them again. I would also make them drive and pick me up next time so that we arrive at the same time. I would also hassle my friend next time they ask me to do something with them and ask them if they will be late.",2.416666667
"I would stay outside and wait for my friend. But if more than 30 minutes goes by and my friend still isn't there, then I would probably go inside and try to strike up a conversation with someone. I usually would not just randomly go up to someone and talk to the, however, in this situation I probably would because I wouldn't want to be isolating myself from everyone else at the party regardless if I know the people who are attending or not. I would be going out if my comfort zone, but if my friend was really late, than I would just go ahead and go inside.",3
"I would wonder where my friend was and, of course, remember that they are always late and wonder why I showed up so early. It is just like that time at my friend's wedding when they said that they would be there at 8, but didn't show up until 9 30. Sometimes, they can be so inconsiderate of others' feelings that I wonder why we are still friends. Then I remember all of the good times we've had and all of the trouble we've gotten into. That doesn't forgive their chronic tardiness, but it does make it a little more bearable.",3.25
I would look around to see if I did know anyone. If not I would try to find some people that looked friendly and start up a conversation with them. If that didn't work I would call my friend and ask whats going on with her. I would ask her how late she would be because this was a little awkward and I feel out of place. I would tell her to try to get here as fast as she could. I would see if I could get a drink and maybe something to eat while I was waiting for my friend.,4.083333333
"In that case I would be severely awkward and feel quite anxious as a matter of fact. I would most likely hide in some corner or just lean against some pillar of some kind and browse my phone. When it gets quite late if it comes to that I would just call my friend and asks him where he is. Depending on his answer, I would stay to meet him or leave if he isn't coming. In the meantime, I would browse more on my phone and try to avoid eye-contact mostly and if anyone tries to talk to me and I would talk to them back.",3.083333333
"If my friend is not there I will probably have something to eat or drink and see if there is someone like me who does not smoke and who does not drink alcohol. I will probably try to talk to some women, because I am married and if I go to talk to a man, sometimes men think that you want something else with them. After I find some women I will introduce myself saying my name and if I can stay with them until my friend arrives, I will probably ask them if they have kids like me or things like that.",3.75
"I would feel very uncomfortable and awkward. I might look around for someone else I know. If I didn't see anyone I knew, I owuld maybe pull out my phone to distract myself. I might call my friend to see where they are and when they think they will be until they get to the party. I might even step outside and wait for them or go sit in my car and wait for them to arrive. If I didn't see my friend soon, I would likely just go home and not even stay at the party.",1.75
"As one who is not comfortable in these types of situations, I would probably head back outside and contact my friend to find out who far away he or she was from the party. I might then wander around inside and check my phone periodically as well as look for something to eat. Next, I would attempt to find someone who was at least an acquaintance and try to strike up a conversation. If my friend continued to not show up, I would probably look for an excuse to go to my car to waste some time in anticipation of my friends arrival.",2
I think I would probably try to give my friend some leeway. Things happen and can make one late. I would text her and ask when I could expect her and how she would like me to proceed. If I do not hear back from her I would probably wait 15 or 20 minutes assuming I drove myself there. If after that time she has not arrived or I took an uber or something I would just go ring the doorbell and introduce myself to the host. I would probably get an alcoholic drink and then look for people who seemed friendly and introduce myself and try to socialize.,4.333333333
"I would feel very uncomfortable with the situation since I was not familiar with the crowd attending the party. I would most likely go back to my car and text or call my friend to find out how long it will be until they arrive. If they were going to be a little while, I would most likely wait in the car until they would arrive because I wouldn't want to go in by myself. If they would be there shortly, I may just wait near the car or outside of the party until they arrived. I would likely play on my phone while waiting to pass the time. I would definitely not go in, as I would be uncomfortable around that many people who I did not know well.",3.666666667
"I would most likely feel pretty awkward in this situation. I am great at parties as long as I know people there. Also if I am stood up by someone who promised to be there, I would more than likely just leave. I have social anxiety to begin with, and I have no issue or guilt when I have to leave a social function suddenly. If someone cares about you they will understand that we do not need to feel bad about not being available to other people constantly. I would then text my friend to either just meet up with me and we can enjoye the evening smoking, or let them know I would not be offended if they still attended the party.",3.5
"If I agreed to go to a party with my friend in which I do not know anyone at the party, and then my friend is late, and I am stuck there with all of these people that I don't know, I am not sure what I would do. The most likely thing that I would do is to pretend like I'm busy on my phone with something, and find a quiet corner in which I can wait until my friend finally shows up. After my friend gets there I would hit them, and then go from there.",2.25
"I would sit around waiting for my friend at the same time trying to talk to new people and to get to know someone new. If he is too late, I would straight up leave because I am not comfortable around new people, if he isnt too late I would hang around and try to socialize with our mutual friends. I think I would pour myself a drink and try to be as friendly and as approachable to others as it is possible for me. Other than that I am not sure what I would do.",1.666666667
"I would wait in the car until she showed up. I would be texting her every few minutes demanding to know where she was. I would also be getting more and more angry with each text. I would especially be getting more and more mad if she did not answer my texts back with her location. I would refuse to go in until she got there since I do not know anyone that is their. I would be angry with her once she did show up. I would be pleasant to the crowd of people at the party, but not her.",3.5
I'd feel pretty upset and uncomfortable realizing that I'm there alone and waiting for my friend. I'd most likely text my friend and or call them to find out where they were. After I found out that information I would go inside to the party anyway. I'd introduce myself to the host and make MY way around the party talking to people. I'd probably find the food or drink table and find something to eat or drink while I was waiting. If my friend was being especially late I would hang around for a little while waiting but would probably leave if they didn't show up.,3.75
"I will be okay, I will not feel bad or upset because he or she is late. I will call her to find out if she is still coming and why she is late. If she is on the way, I will go into the party and make the rounds and introduce myself to everyone. I will try to gauge the guest and see who I can strike a conversation with. I will limit the topic of conversation to my interests and carrier. While doing that I will check on my phone to make sure I am not missing any messages from my friend.",2.333333333
I would feel very uncomfortable and like my friend hung me out to dry. I'm not great with people I don't know so I would probably try to grab a beer and sit somewhere by myself. I might walk around a little bit just to figure out if there were any people with similar interests I could converse with in the meantime. If there weren't people I would have an easy time getting along with I would contact my friend and see if they were still coming. If they weren't coming soon I would just leave.,2
"I would feel very uncomfortable and nervous. I would seek my friend out and probably stay close to them while I get acclimated to the environment and as I was introduced to people that I did not know. I would feel extremely frustrated and most likely a bit mad as I do not like social situations in which I do not know anyone present. They deeply trigger my anxiety and I would feel near physically ill from being there in that situation. I would attempt to contact my friend and see where they were at. Depending upon the situation, I would probably also seek out a drink and try to find a place somewhere in the corner or perimeter where I could check out my surroundings and get a feel for the place. I would attempt to introduce myself to people and get adjusted to the situation and my environment.",1.833333333
"In situations like this, I often look for a bar or punch table and fill a glass with ginger ale. I do not like being drunk or tipsy anywhere, let alone in unfamiliar surroundings. Then, with glass in hand, I head over to a garden area or some location with many potted plants. I have some horticultural experience, and if a stranger comes along, I will at least have some ammunition that I can use in a ice-breaker conversation with him or her. Once in a while I find someone that does, indeed, enjoy a good round of botany talk. And if not, I just go back to perusing the foliage.",2.333333333
I would feel irritated that my friend was not there and I had to wait. I would wait for my friend outside the party since I do not know the hosts and do not want to appear to be a party crasher. I would call my friend to find out where they are and how long before they will be arriving. If they will be arriving in less than thirty minutes I would make arrangements to meet them prior to them entering the party. If they are going to be more than thirty minutes I would cancel my appearance at the party.,3.333333333
"I would circulate and get to know the other people at the party while I am waiting for my friend who is late in arriving to the party. I would introduce myself to the host and apologize that my friend is not yet here and explain that they are expected shortly. In the meantime, I would network with the people I meet there and try to cultivate professional contacts as this is an important and I hope to be able to broaden my social network. I would feel energized, motivated, outgoing, social, friendly, warm, and satisfied with these interactions.",3.75
"Given how I feel about this arrangement, and the fact that it would not be a preferred way of going to the party I'd rather go together with my friend, arriving at the party and finding that my friend is not there would feel rather awkward. In order to kill some time, I would most likely pretend, at first, that I have an important phone call to make. In reality, I would probably call my friend and ask about his whereabouts. Then I would probably look for some food and drinks, all in order to kill some time before my friend shows up. Finally, I would probably look around and find if there is anyone I can start a conversation with.",2.25
"I would feel slightly peeved, if I arrived and they were late. I'd immediately place a call, and find out my friend's estimated time of arrival. Then, depending on the layout, I would probably either linger around the door to the event, or a place outside with a good view, so that my friend could easily spot me once they arrived. While I could go inside and mingle, I would refrain from doing so, due to not knowing the host nor most of the crowd, and not wanting to hurt my friend's chances.",3.166666667
I would feel completely out of place. I am absolutely terrible at meeting new people and I know I need to chance that about myself. I think I would try to just stand out of the way and look busy on my phone until my friend showed up. If someone did talk to me I would be nice and try to continue that conversation as long as possible. The main idea is to just not embarrass my friend in any way because I know this is important to them. Still I would also be wishing I could meet people in a better way.,1.083333333
"I would feel really anxious. I don't like being here. My friend knows I don't like being around people. I would get really panicky and resentful. I would start thinking bad thoughts about my friend. I would hide in the corner for a while. Hopefully I would not get noticed. I would keep my face to the floor while texting my friend. I would wait until I received a response or someone starts talking to me before leaving. I would wait an hour or so. If I haven't heard anything by then, I would leave.",1.083333333
"I would introduce myself to some people there and make some friends. I'll explain that I'm supposed to be meeting my friend, and just try to have fun while I wait. I hope they don't tell me to leave. But it's a party so I don't think that will happen. I'll just hang out and chat with people there and even offer to be helpful so they don't mind me being there. I do hope my friend shows up before too long, this is a bit of an awkward situation for me to be in. I'll just try to make the best of it.",4
"I would feel shy around people I don't know at a party, but I would introduce myself to the host and let them know that my friend who is late invited me. I would probably try to make small talk about my friend. I hope the host would offer me refreshments, and I would then try to make small talk about the refreshments to anyone who was around. I would feel anxious without my friend being there and would be a little annoyed at my friend. I would be relieved when my friend arrived.",2.916666667
I would go in and introduce myself to the host and let him know I was my friend's plus-one and that apparently he was running late. I would scope out the people to see if there was someone I at least knew by sight. I would go to the food and strike up a conversation with others getting food. I would pick up a soft drink and find a place to sit. I would engage in conversation while keeping an eye out for my friend's arrival. I'd send him a text message to let him know I was there and already inside the party.,3.416666667
First of all I am searching my friend in several places and after searching I make myself comfortable in one place just watching the party alone and searching for any other familiar faces wandering. If no one is familiar I make a phone call to my friend saying that I am waiting at the party and ask him to come quickly. Meantime I like to introduce myself to a girl alone with good looking and want to spend time with her. If she accepts me I will not bother my friend making further late.,3.666666667
"Its really kinda tough situation, I better avoid this kinda situation, if I come to know after entering into the function about this, then I might try to talk with people whom my friend might know. Or I will better exit the venue till arrival of my friend. Best way is to handle the situation, like getting away from the crowded or noticeable prone areas to lonely area like upstairs or children parks if available. Maybe entering into dining to a better idea, but sure will wait for my friend to arrive to enter into actual place with people.",3.166666667
I realize my friend late in at the situation. I feel little fear in my mind. My thought is wait my friend in the party. I am not meet the party member and are not very familiar with the crowed of people. I am not interested this situation. And I am understand my friend situation at the time in my friend in late attend the party in this situation. I am attend the party in sharp 9 pm. And my friend in late attend the party in personal reason on this situation in our house.,2.583333333
"I am very outgoing, so I would just join in the party. I would find the host first and introduce myself as such and such's friend. I would try to break the ice by introducing myself to other guests. I would get a drink and food as to not to feel so awhward. I will slyly watch the door to see when my friend arrives. I would text her to find out when she expects to arrive and try to mingle until she gets there. I am not shy so this would be okay with me unless alot of time passed without my friend arriving.",4.416666667
"this is an awful situation for me. I would look around first to see if there was anyone who I knew. If not, I would look around to see if there was someone who was alone and not interacting with others and try to approach them and talk to them. If there is no one like that, my first action would be to leave the party and wait outside until my friend got there. Then go back inside with them and let them introduce me to their friends. It is the worst possible scenerio for me to be with a group of strangers.",1.583333333
"I would feel completely uncomfortable, since I don't know anyone and I could not interact socially in a simple way without feeling isolated, I usually avoid social interactions since I get stressed or feel very anxious. In the same way, I would try to tell my friend to tell me if it will take too long to get to the place or ask him if he can make the effort to contact the host of the party, to see if it makes me feel welcome and I stop feeling that I don't belong since it is a social event to which I was not directly invited.",2.083333333
"I would feel quit uncomfortable at first since my friend was not there yet. I would attempt to find the host of the party and introduce myself as having been invited by my friend. I would not want the host or hostess to think I was crashing the event. After that, I most probably would find a quiet corner to sit and wait for my friend to arrive. I would interact with others if I was approached but would not make any first attempts at conversation for fear of embarrassing my friend. I would wait a respectable amount of time and if my friend did not show up soon I would make a quiet exit.",2.75
"I would call my friend to find out where they are. But even if I could not reach them, I would enter the party go to the bar and start a converstaion with other people. Or try to join a conversation, and introduce myself to a few indiviuals. I would carry on small talk, but I would be annoyed that my friend was late in addition I would have a drink to loosen up a little and try to enjoy myself while waiting for their arrival If there was a game or something interactive going on, I would watch until I understood the procees, then make every attempt to join in. Hopefully I would be accepted and make some new friends.",3.583333333
I would feel a little left out at first. I would be kind of awkward because I do not know anyone at the part and my friend isn't there. I would eventually work up the courage to introduce myself to people so break the ice a little bit. I think once people got to know me they would open up to me and I would feel a lot more comfortable being able to communicate. When my friend does arrive I would introduce him to everyone else that I met so that he could catch up quickly.,4.583333333
I would feel really awkward but as it is a party I would assume there's at least a few people who might be interested in talking to me. I would look for something interesting or novel about the house to maybe start a conversation with someone about it or if no one wanted to really chat I could just check it out cause it's different. Like someone with a second floor balcony or a big fish tank. If my friend had not shown up after 15 to 30 mins I could start to get a little worried and I would call her cell phone.,2.166666667
"This would never happen lol, I would never agree to this in the first place. If I were to agree to something like this, the meet would be somewhere other than the party, and we would arrive together. Now for some reason I did agree to such a thing, and realized I was alone at this party, I guess I would grab a drink and go outside to the pool area, or maybe back out front. I would try to be semi-social but I would not get over my head with people I don't yet know.",3.25
"I would probably hang around for a while until he is there, I would try to talk a little bit to the other people, and have some drinks, if he's taking a lot of time to get there, then I would probably call him, if he's taking too much time, I would probably leave eventually, or maybe not if I find someone to talk to. If I'm too drunk then I would probably take a cab to take me home, then I would complain to my friend for not showing up and leaving me there.",1.166666667
My friend invites me to a party. I do not know any of her friends. I am sitting outside where the party is being held waiting for my friend in my car. I feel neglected and alone. It has been ten minutes and I question if I should go ahead and go inside and explain who I am and that I am waiting on our mutual friend. Would they welcome me? Or would they think I was a party crasher? I get out my cell phone and call my friend who says they are on their way to wait outside for her. I feel a bit relieved I don't have to go into that party by myself.,2.416666667
"That is very tough situation to go through. Sure I will wait for my friend till he come. My eyes will search all around to find any person with whom I am acquaintance with. I will pray for it. After searching for it, I will go to a corner seat and will sit there. I will call my friend over phone again to come fast. Then slowly my mind will settle because now I am aware that anyway I have to go through this situation. Though I want my friend to come fast, still my mind will manage this. Then I will bring my mobile out of my pocket and will do something in it though I have nothing to do and thus I will spend my time there.",2.166666667
"I would feel really out of place and insecure because I don't know the host, but I would go up to the host and introduce myself so they don't wonder who I am and who I was suppose to come to the party with. I would try to find something in common to talk about. If I got too uncomfortable, I would ask to be excused and directed to the bathroom to have a few minutes of alone time and hope that my friend shows up in the mean time. I may go outside to get some fresh air and get to know someone one on one that's out there to so I can see when my friend arrives or I would just text and wait for them in my car until they actually got to the party and I would walk back in the party with them. I'd probably be able to enjoy the party after my friend got there.",2.166666667
"I would explain to my friend that I am rather unfamiliar with the people at the party when she gets there. In the meantime, I would feel somewhat estranged as this is not really my plan, but rather a nice invite from my friend. I would still check out the party and see if I like it, but after a couple of moments I would likely leave if she does not show up at the important party. I would just go with the flow until I feel uncomfortable. Than take intiative and do what I want to if I am not feeling it.",3.5
"First of all, I'd primarily be concerned about the reason my friend is late. I'd start running through scenarios in my mind- were they stuck in traffic, late leaving home because of a family issue, etc? I'd call them on their cell phone and maybe also send them a text, letting them know I'd arrived at the party and would wait for them to arrive, since I didn't know the host. I'd start to get worried if I didn't hear back from my friend in a reasonable amount of time. Meanwhile, I'd sit in my car and play sudoku on my phone while I waited for their response.",2.666666667
"I would feel annoyed and a bit sad. I would have looked forward to seeing my friend and hanging out with them so I would feel a bit off in this type of scenario. Overall, I would try to make the best of it and wait for my friend. If they did come, I'd try to look for opportunities to socialize and meet new people. I'd make conversation with anyone who was willing. I'd feel good if I did that and socialized with others. At some point I'd eventually leave if my friend didn'y make it but I'd be happy if I took the time to make new friends and talk to others.",3.166666667
"At first I would feel a bit nervous going to a new place where I don't know anyone, but that's fine I'll just be there and wait for my friend. I might try out some food and drink a little bit to let me deal with the time give or take. Maybe I'll talk to some people and get to know them, I have no problem making small talk. I'm sure I'd have a decent conversation to strike up that can become a deep and open discussion. During that time I'm probably wondering how long is it going to be before my friend is going to show up.",4.25
"This has actually happened to me several different times in my life. Many friends have asked me to attend an important party to which he or she has been invited. If I am available I usually go with them. There have also been many times that they are running late. When this happens, whether I know the people or not, I definitely take the opportunity to get to know them better through conversation and common interests. I have found that getting to know others is almost always a great experience. Sometimes I hope they are late.",5
"I would feel extremely uncomfortable. I would probably start to drink if they had alcohol available or I would leave and go get something to drink and come back and try to blend in easily while I wait for my friend. I would definitely be annoyed by my friends and feel a bit abandoned at the moment, but would be okay if they had a good enough excuse. I'd try to make the best of the situation. I would also blame myself a bit for coming too early since most people tend to show up to things late.",3.166666667
"I would feel very shy and probably irritated that my friend was running late. I would hang around outside and try not to interact with anyone. I would be texting my friend to see when they were planning to arrive. I would stay outside or possibly in my car and would play on my phone or listen to the radio waiting for my friend to arrive. I would probably not be very happy as I did not want to go in the first place, but went because it was for my friend.",3.083333333
I would feel sad that my friend did not show up on time and feel that they did not think it was very important to them because they did not show up on time. I would be less likely to go to a party with them again if they asked because I would be worried that they would be late again and I would be in the same situation at a future party if I were to go with them again. I would try to blend in the crowd and would not talk with many people until my friend showed up because I would be worried that other people would ask how I was able to get into the party.,1.583333333
"I don't like waiting on people or when they are late. I would feel like my friend does not value my time and is taking advantage of me. With that said, I would make the most of my time by attempting to find the host and introducing myself. By doing this I would not feel as bothered waiting for my friend and would not be bored. But since I don't know the host or anyone there, it will be a bit awkward trying to find the host or introducing myself to people as they will not understand why I am there.",3.25
"I think that I would first call my friend or send him or her a text asking him how long he or she was going to be late. I would feel very uncomfortable without him or her being there but I don't want to be too much of an introvert so I would introduce myself to a few people. I would strike up a conversation with like-minded people, and see how they know my friend. After a while, I would find a spot to hang out by myself until my friend finally gets to the party.",1.25
I am feel so guilty but my friend situation has understand. Maybe he has critical situation so do not attend the function. I am don't angry to my friend I am enjoy and talking with other peoples. They talking to very friendly and enjoy fully so I have forget my guilty feel and then going to attend the party. It very wonderful party I am very happy of that moment. But just a bit of feel. My friend missing this party this is a very enjoyable moment. He is a unlucky person that think my mind.,3.666666667
"I would be extremely upset as I do not like parties. I would wait a few minutes before making a decision to simply leave or not. I would use that time to make every effort to contact my friend to figure out what was going on. During the time I waiting I would definitely be stewing and pushing myself into a worse mood. I would be focusing all of my energy on negativity and how terrible my situation was in. I would, essentially, be willing myself into a horrible experience.",1.5
I would feel all alone and like they left me by myself. I would be mad. I probably would wait in a corner or somewhere where there arent a lof ot people for my friend. I would try to call them or text. If they would not be there soon I'd go and sit in my car or somewhere in another room. I'd be so embarrassed and so mad at my friend. I hate being alone by myself at parties. I would feel all alone and not sure what to do with myself.,1.916666667
"I would probably just not enter the party and hang out outside until my friend arrived. I would probably spend my time trying to contact him. If I felt I had to go inside, I would go inside and look for anyone I knew. If I knew nobody, I would look for someone that I thought I may have something in common with. I'd probably try to drink a lot to loosen myself up and if I had enough alcohol I'd probably stop caring if my friend showed up or not.",3.083333333
I would feel very awkward as I hate being at parties with other people that I do not know. I would probably find a quiet corner alone and wait patiently for my friend to arrive while feeling very shy and awkward. I might look at social media on my cell phone and just kill time as I wait on my friend. I would be slightly annoyed my friend is running late but I promised to go with them so I would wait. I always keep my promises and I never bail on a friend.,2.166666667
"I feel very uncomfortable because I don't know anybody there and I am looking for any familiar faces. I will phone to my friend immediately and ask him how long it will take for him to reach there. If it takes to much time I will take a walk outside to a coffee shop and I would like to spend time with some reading magazines, and cell phone chat etc. If I see any familiar face in the party entrance I would like to join with him and spend time. Definetly it was disgusting in this type of situation being alone. I will feel little angry on my friend.",2.916666667
"I dislike going to parties. I am okay with walking up to people and starting a conversation, but I do not enjoy it. So most likely, if I were at a party and my friend was late, I would likely call someone I know and start talking to them until my friend showed up. If I couldn't do that, I would probably sit in a corner somewhere and start playing with my cell phone. I would literally do this, even read a book, until someone started talking to me or my friend showed up.",2.916666667
"I would first feel a little angry that my friend was late for his or her own important party. If it were so important, why are they late? I would try to make the best of the situation and socialize with some of the people that were already there. If my friend still had not showed up after introducing myself to everyone and socializing for a bit, then I would try calling my friend to find out if they were okay and if they needed help. If I did not reach them, I would leave a voicemail and text as well to try to get an answer. I might ask some of the people at the party if my friend is normally late for get-togethers.",3.083333333
I would feel extremely awkward in this situation. I have a problem being around strangers anyway so I know I would feel uncomfortable and out of place. I would probably stand outside and wait for my friend to show up. I might call my friend and sit in the car until she shows up. I definitely would not be able to go inside on my own though. If I tried it's quite possible that I would have an anxiety attack and embarrass myself to the point that I would not be able to look my friend in the eye or go anywhere with her again.,1
"I have never met the host, and I am not very familiar with the crowd of people who will be attending the party. So I will introduce myself immediately. I would get a drink and some appetizers, and go off to the side to assess the situation. I may not miss my friend if things start happening for me. I hate it when people are late. It really bugs me. But, this would be a situation that could be salvaged. Maybe one of the prettier women will like my look, and sidle up to me. Isn't that what they do? Sidle up? Yep. And I would be very welcome to the attention.",2.583333333
"To be honest, I might feel a little uncomfortable, but I think it would depend on the people and the crowd. I have been in this situation before and it does feel a bit awkward. When I was in this situation before, I grabbed a drink and started talking with some people at the bar. I continued my conversation with them for a while and looked around to scope out the scene and see what the coolest things to do there were. I think I would do this so that when my friend got there I could tell her everything that was going on so we could decide what to do and be better informed about it.",4.333333333
"I would wait outside and smile and greet people as they arrived. It wouldn't be my place to enter the party without my friend, since they are the one who was invited and since I am their guest. Saying hello to people outside and being friendly is a way where I could become familiar to others, and to show that I am a friendly guest. If my friend wasn't there by 9 30 PM, I would go inside, ask for the host and introduce myself, explain who I was invited by and that they are late, and then have a drink and chat with anyone.",4.75
I would be a little bit irritated that she was late and I would start calling her and asking her where she is. I guess while waiting I would try to mingle around and try to pretend that I belong there. I might grab a soda or a snack if they were there because you can look kind of casual and relaxed if you are snacking or sipping. I also might pretend to be on my phone having a conversation so that I don't have to interact with anyone. I might go outside and look around for her.,1.583333333
"I would feel uncomfortable, but I would make the best of the situation. I would introduce myself and I would explain to the host or hostess that I am there as the plus one of one of their invited guests who has not arrived. I would apologize for arriving too early, and politely ask if it would be alright to wait inside for my friend. After being allowed in I would quietly say hello to whoever I passed by as I made my way to an indiscreet area of the room to wait for my friend. If anyone approached me I would politely introduce myself and let them know that I am waiting for my friend. Should anyone be kind enough to start a conversation with me I will go with the flow!",3.333333333
"I'd probably feel a little uncomfortable since I never met the host but I would politely introduce myself as a friend of so and so and would go inside, call my friend on the phone to find out how late he'll be and let him know I am waiting, then I would try to enjoy myself at the party while I wait for my friend. I would not know anyone at the party but would try to be friendly and polite to people as I wait for my friend to show up.",3.666666667
It would be very unusual to accept a party where I do not know anybody. On acceptance I will prepare myself accordingly to visit the party and wait for the friend. I would like to reach party Dandy and with a sense of happiness. After reaching I will wait for my friend till he arrives for company. And in between times I would like to study people around in the party and the party itself. I would not like to throw myself talking to unknown people and others in the party. But I would like to refer my friends name on asking about my attendance in the party. I would like to introduce myself to new people and the host for them and party's comfort. As time will fly by introducing myself I am sure my friend will reach in moment and give me company. After his reaching and acknowledgement I am sure there will be more happiness and friendliness in the party. Thus I will like to keep up the life of the party and the evening itself. On my friends reach I will greet him and continue to party till the end of it.,3.416666667
I will wait for mg friend for some time. I will keep calling him. If he didn't pick the call I will became anger and leaves a voice message saying that attend my call. After waiting for 1 or 2 Hours I will walk away and went my home and never return the party or speak to my friend. I feel very irritated at the moment when he didn't follow the time he said. I would wait in that place because I don't know anyone there. So I will walk away.,3.916666667
"Having done some quick Googling on the way to the party I would have a baseline knowledge of the host and the likely guests. That is nice information to know but any situation like this doesn't really have a script. I would take pleasure in meeting the new people and try to find common ground through good conversation. A drink always helps but a little chit chat can go a long way. I'd be a little nervous but not overly so and would hope to meet someone that I could make a new connection with. I'd view it as both a challenge an opportunity- hopefully with good food, booze and company.",4.5
"I would wait in my car until my friend arrived. I already don't like socializing, parties, nor meeting new people. I would not feel comfortable going into the party alone. It would be a lot for me to even agree to go to the party in the first place. I would sit in my car and play games on my phone until my friend arrived. I would be irritated that they were late. I would read emails, check social media, and text other people. I would keep texting my friend for an eta.",2.416666667
I would jovially introduce myself to the host and apologize for my friends tardiness. I would gladly meet or introduce myself to anyone the host should like. I would find myself a drink or snack if there were any. I would meander around the room introducing myself as I went. I would explain that I am meeting my friend at the party but she was late. I would not feel weird or out of place because I am outgoing and am at ease speaking to others. I adapt and over come easily.,4.5
I will first check if my friend has come to the party venue as confirmed by him at nine. If I find my friend is late to the party venue I would definitely avoid going into the party venue which is not at all familiar to me. I would feel very uncomfortable and embarrassed waiting there outside for my friend to arrive since the party is totally unfamiliar to me. I will again check my friends status over phone about his status of arrival to the party. I will inform him and I will return back to my home.,3.583333333
"I would stay near the walls and get an overview of the party. I'd check out the food and drink, maybe get a little something to sip and nurse as I walked around the party, keeping an eye out for my friend. I wouldn't try to initiate a lot of contacts but wouldn't be shy or afraid to talk to people. I'd be polite and casually formal, smiling and making eye contact but not being aggressively friendly. With luck I'd find someone interesting to talk to who I could position in such a way that I could still keep an eye on the door for my friend's delayed arrival.",3.166666667
I would feel very strange because no one would know who I am. I would introduce myself and ask if anyone happen to see or hear from my friend because she or he were to meet me here at this particular time. I would asked if it is fine with the hostess to seat me until my friend arrives. I would try and make myself feel comfortable so no one would look at me as an intruder and why was I there. I would get a drink and try to be calm until my friend arrives.,2.333333333
"If my friend is late, I will choose a plate to sit. That place will be some what distance from the event happening place. So that, no one can notice me. Since it is an unfamiliar place and unfamiliar people, I can not talk to them and participate in the party. I will sit in the separate place and observe what is happening in the party and how the people are enjoying in the party. I will ask about my friend's arrival through mobile phone. I will inform him that, I am waiting for you and come fast. In the meanwhile, I will speak with my spouse and friends through mobile phone to spend some time. I will be little angry for waiting that much of time. Because punctuality is more important in life. I will inform the same to my friend.",4.166666667
"I guess I would sit on some distant chair or bench if such are available and wait for the friend to arrive. Probably after about 30 minutes of lateness, I will try to text the friend and check where he or she is. If after some time I do not receive a reply, I will leave the place. What I know for sure is that I will not try at least easily mingle with the crowd, although questions such as what time is it? Or do you know person X, who invited me to this event? Would not be rare by me.",2.25
I would feel annoyed that my friend did not arrive at the time we agreed upon. Since I don't know anyone at the party I would probably start looking for food to eat in order to pass the time. A party that doesn't have good food or snacks at it also stinks. After finding some food I would call my friend on the phone to find out where he or she was and explain that there wasn't much to do at the party since they are not there. Hopefully the time between my arrival and my friend's arrival is small so that I don't feel bored and even more annoyed.,3.166666667
"I would wish that I had been late! And wonder if anyone had seen me, can I creep out to my car and wait for my friend to show up? Why in the world did I agree to do this when I could be at home, sitting on my couch in my pj's watching reruns of Live PD, instead of being in a strangers place feeling like I am crashing the party. If I can't sneak out, I would find the food and drinks table and get a snack because If I am going to be miserable I might as well not be hungry. Plus having food and a drink will give me something to do, instead of standing there like a lonely creeper.",4
"If I was invited to attend a party with a friend to a place that I did not know with strangers, and my friend was late, I would spend my time outside of the home or party location, likely on my phone, waiting for my friend to arrive. I am not a social butterfly so I would be very unlikely to go in and introduce myself alone in this situation. If my friend was so late that I became annoyed or extremely irritable, I would end up leaving the party rather than continue to wait for them to arrive. This would make me angry unless there were a very good reason for the late arrival of my friend.",2.416666667
"I WILL CONFIRM ABOUT THE PARTY AND PEOPLE OF THE CROWD WITH MY FRIEND. AFTER REACHED THE PARTY, I HAD REALIZED THAT MY FRIEND IS LATE MEANS DEFINITELY I WILL FEEL VERY NERVOUS. FIRST I WILL MAKE CALLS TO URGE MY FRIEND TO COME QUICK. AND SEARCHING THE PEOPLE IN THE CROWD, WHO IS COMFORTABLE FOR ME TO MAKE SOME CONVERSATION. AND I AM SEARCHING THE ENTRANCE FOR MY FRIEND'S ENTRY. I AM COMFORTABLE TO THAT PLACE BECAUSE I DID NOT KNOW ANY ONE AND ANY DETAILS ABOUT THAT PARTY. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO WAIT.",3.583333333
"in this time first I call and ask where are you and when you reach the place, if he come late means I will wait outside of the party place, without knowing we will not go inside because its make my friends image into lower level, my friend only invite and have to go that party. Same time me also have means with that late period I will finish that, otherwise I will go tea shop and eat some snacks and will drink tea and read newspaper and spend a lot of time, up to my friend will come, next will make small talk and call my friend.",3.166666667
I would feel a little nervous and anxious because my friend was late. I would probably be in my phone being awkward until my friend arrived. I would think to myself that being in your phone isnt friendly so I would try my best to mingle with people around me. I would crack a lame joke to break up the tension that I feel and make light conversation with those around me. Eventualy I would feel comfortable and not worry about my friend being late. Once my friend shows up I would introduce her to the friends I made.,3.25
"I would feel comfortable especially if I knew the crowd. I woyld say hello and try to have conversations with as many people as I could. I would also be chevking my phone to see if my friend texted me. I would eventually find my qay to the snacks pick a few abd sit somewhere I wasn't noticed and wait until my friend arrived. If sge hadnt arrived by a certain time, I would just leave. I have done it before and I would do it again. I am not a people person and would have mo qualms about leaving.",1.833333333
I would give it a few minutes and if my friend hadn't arrived I would go into the party and introduce myself and who my friend is. I would strike up a conversation and perhaps get a cocktail. I would keep mixing and meeting the people there until my friend arrived. If he or she hasn't arrived I would text to find out if they are okay and when they may arrive. If they didn't respond I would let the host know the situation and let them know I would be leaving. If they invited me to stay I would.,3.666666667
"I would be a little annoyed that they wanted me to come to this party and they were invited, and wanted me to come with them and that they were not there yet. I would probably call or text them and find out their estimated time of arrival and possibly wait for them if they were going to be there some what soon. If I had all ready walked inside I would be a little nervous at first, but I would introduce myself and start mingling with other party guests while I wait for my friend to show up. See if I could find someone to talk to for a bit.",4.916666667
"If I hadn't gone in I would wait outside and kill time until my friend arrived. I would prefer to walk in with him or her if I could. If I had already gone in, I would try to make small talk with the people until they got there. I would probably try to find the host and introduce myself and let them know why I was there. I would also try to find something in common with the people I talked to so I could have a better conversation. I would also grab a drink because I would feel more comfortable and would loosen up if I had a drink.",3.166666667
I would feel very awkward being by myself and not being at all familiar with anyone else there. I probably would just sit in a chair in the corner and try to avoid interacting with anyone because I feel bad about myself and like I'm very boring. I wouldn't want to invite people into my life for any reason and I just think it's pointless. I would be eagerly waiting for my friend to arrive so I would have someone to spend time with. I would most likely eat if there's food there since that would distract me from getting too worried about what's going on.,1.416666667
I would not even go inside the party until my friend arrived. I would feel nervous and embarassed that we were late. I would be upset with my friend for making me sit there by myself waiting for them. I would call them and ask where they were. I would probably raise my voice cause I would be upset. When they got there I would be a pain in the ass for a bit and wouldn't want to become involved in conversation with anyone. I would be stand offish and reluctant to make eye contact. I would probably pour myself a drink and find a corner to sulk.,3.25
I would mingle talk to others and really try to get to know the people at the parties and it would be fun and great to do that. I would do my best to talk to everyone I know and would want the best for them. I would want them to mingle and get to know everyone and be with these people. And I would just wait it out until my close friends arrived and the. Probably ask why they were so late. Overall it would be a good thing and it would work well for me.,4.083333333
The first thing I would do is text my friend. Given that I only accepted the invitiation was to accompany the friend I would feel put out and kind of miffed that they were late. In the mean time I would try to hang out near the enterance outside the party so when my friend got there we could go in. I would occupy my time playing games on my phone or another similar time waster. If my friend didn't respond back I would be upset and I would probably go home. I don't know the people at the party and wasn't invited. Gate crashing a party is not my thing.,2
I would feel pretty lousy that my friend leaves me sitting there alone when they know I don't know anyone. I would probably grab some food and mingle a little while I wait for my friend. I would contact my friend to see when they're coming and then decide whether or not I'm going to stay or not. I would wait for my friend as long as they were going to show up and go and get them if needed. I would probably meet the host and introduce myself. I would wait for a while and then leave if my friend doesn't show up.,3.166666667
Nothing. I don't get angry. Simply I am waiting for my friend. He might be busy with some other important work. So I will wait for him. First I try to find a place to relax. I spend some time with my smartphone. I play games and watching video. Sometime I chat with friends if they online. And I smoke for a while. I am searching is there any familiar face to chat if I found I will chat with them. I will make call to my family and chat with my kids. And asking what are you doing honey? Have you had your dinner? What is mother? I love my family. Then I look around the environment and party arrangements and decorations. If there any drinks or food I would like to have. I will make a small walking around here and there. If my friend is getting delay more than my tolerable time I try to move from the party. I will make call to my friend and said we will meet in another day because its getting late to my family. I inform to my friend finally I left the place.,2.75
"I would feel a little uncomfortable being at a party with a crowd of people I do not know. I would also feel awkward, that since my friend is running late this party, he or she, were the only person I know and the person that invited me. I would have to push myself to get out and mingle, because standing there would make me feel even more uncomfortable. I would most likely walk through and grab me a drink and start a conversation with someone. While socializing, I am also killing time until my friend arrives at this party.",2.25
"I would feel out of place and self conscious. I would look for a job, offer to help the host with something related to the party, or something useful to give myself some purpose and legitimacy. If there were parents with kids I'd go talk to them because kids are a natural ice breaker. I am awkward socially and would not want to make small talk with strangers. I would be hoping the whole time that my friend would arrive soon and would wish that I had waited in my car until confirming that she had already arrived.",1.75
"I would have a great deal of anxiety if I realized my friend was not at the party. I would avoid small talk and eye contact if at all possible, and would find distractions such as going to the bathroom in order to avoid people. If there was a bar at the party, I would quickly either order a drink, or make one for myself. I would use my phone as a distraction, pretending to be either texting or reading intently, in order to avoid people. If it took a considerable amount of time for my friend to arrive, I would find a way to go outside to my car and wait, and if given enough time, I would simply leave.",2.166666667
I would feel very anxious and uncomfortable. I would probably start sweating. I would constantly be checking my phone to see if they texted me and would probably call or text them to see where they were. I would probably be hanging around outside of wherever the party was trying not to seem weird or would walk around the block or something. If I could not wait outside I would be hiding in a corner or something not really talking to anyone. I would be very nervous. If there was snacks or drinks or something I would probably go get something to have something to do with my hands and to appear less nervous. I probably wouldn't talk to anyone unless they came up to me and started talking to me first.,1.416666667
"I would feel very uncomfortable and awkward. I would feel regretful that I came to the party and would wish I had told my friend no about joining her. I would probably wait in my car for my friend so that I didn't have to speak to anyone I didn't know. I would call my friend to find out where she was and if she was not close, I may decide to leave. I would probably play on my phone so that I could look busy and keep people from paying attention to me. I would text my friend repeatedly until she arrived, and I would be irritated with her because I came for her benefit and she wasn't on time and didn't call to tell me she would be late.",1.333333333
"I would feel incredibly awkward. However, I would walk up to the door and knock, I would then introduce myself as a friend of my friend. I would then enter the party and find the liquor. I would find some vodka or rum and start drinking to take the awkwardness away. I would then find another person who looks awkward as well and then would go introduce myself to them. I feel that me and this person could become great friends. This person probably got stood up by their friends as well. It would be a bonus if this person was attractive as well.",3.583333333
"I would be quite upset when I realize that my friend is not yet at the party. I would be filled with regret for agreeing to show up at the party. Or perhaps just filled with regret that I didn't say we should meet somewhere first and drive there together. I would feel uncomfortable at the party and would not want to be there at all. I might make small talk with some people, or maybe just grab a drink and play on my phone. I would not want to be there. Depending on how long my friend is going to take I may just leave. I would for sure reach out to the friend to find out how late they are going to be.",3.25
"I would definitely feel very awkward. I am not a real social butterfly. The first thing I would do is text my friend and find out why she was late. My next move would depend on her reply. If she wasn't coming to the party at all, I would try to make a quick get away. If she was just running a little late, I would try to remain calm until she got there. If she was going to be really late, I would have to venture out on my own and make small talk with the other guests, hoping to find someone I has something in common with or who knew my friend.",1.666666667
"This wouldn't really be a problem for me as I don't really have an issue with talking to strangers. I would text my friend to make she that she is still coming. If she was no longer coming, I would leave but if she was just running late, I would hang out and chat with someone. I would probably get something to drink and possibly eat. If there were music, I would dance for a while. I would tell my friend to find me when she gets there or text me so that we could meet up. Since it is a party, I imagine everyone would be friendly and chances are not everyone knows everyone else anyway.",3.75
"I would feel kind of nervous being there without really knowing any of the people. However, I'd make the best of it and introduce myself to the host. I'd let them know that I was my invited friends guest. After that I would find something to eat and or or drink. I'm not really talkative in these types of new settings, but I'd definitely find some people to talk to or find a group of people and introduce myself. The goal in this type of situation is to do my best to remain chill while waiting for my friend to get there. I'd have general conversation with people about their lives. I'd ask them what they do, what are their hobbies, if they are married, where do they like to go for vacation, do they have any pets and what brings them to the party.",2.916666667
"I would be smart and look for her car in the parking lot. I would be texting her to find out if she was inside the party or not. And when bshe text me baxk saying she would be late I would wait for her in my car. I would listen to the radio and watch the other guests arriving and see if I can spot anyone I know. I'd keep muself busy by texting other friends and family, sxrolling through Facebook and playing games on my phone. I would try to not get upset at my friend for being late, but most likely will anyway. I'd give her 20 minutes, then I'd leave and just go home.",3.333333333
"I would feel a little nervous if my friend were late and I were on my own at the important party full of unfamiliar people. I would quickly call her to make sure nothing terrible has happened to her. Presuming she's okay, I would take a deep breath and think to myself, Here we go! Next, I would go to the bar or buffet area and, as I was waiting for a drink and or or making up a plate, I would strike up a conversation. I might talk to the bartender, the server, or anyone who also was waiting for a drinking or getting food. I'd chat with whomever was nearby and or or seemed friendly- and then I'd have people to introduce when my friend arrives.",4.416666667
I would be mortified and have a lot of anxiety. I don't like situations in which I don't know many people in a large group so this would be a nightmare scenario for me. I would do my best so that I wouldn't ruin this important opportunity for my friend but I would have to be in contact with them and be assured that they are almost there. I may also be looking for any reason to leave this party and get somewhere that I'd be more comfortable. Actually just thinking about this has made me very uncomfortable so it's possible that I wouldn't even try to stay at the party and would just leave immediately.,2.416666667
"I would be very nervous if I got there before my friend. I would go into the party and see what the situation is. If its a situation where most people are talking and they don't notice me I would walk around and just act like I should be there, If people notice me and want to talk I would make small talk and then try and slip outside until my friend gets there. I would probably then text my friend and let them know I'm there and waiting for them. I probably wouldn't go back into the party until my friend gets there so that I could go in with them and not feel weird about the situation.",1.666666667
Once I found out my friend was not there I would look for something to eat. Or. Drink. By doingng this. I would have a way to start a conversation with some of the. People. I would quietly listen to a group of people by sitting close to a group. I would say hi and explain that I am waiting for my late. Friend and ask if anyone knows her. I would start a conversation from that topic and move forward with getting to know people while I waited. Thrn I would make sure my friend knew. I didn't appreciate her being late. And not letting me. Know.,4.583333333
"I would feel very awkward at this event. My first action would be to text or message my friend to see how late she was going to be. If she was going to be several hours late I would probably just leave, but if she was planning to be there soon, I would try to mingle. I would probably go for the food first, and then look around the room for someone who seemed equally out of place as me and try to start up a conversation with them. Barring that, I would probably just play around on my phone until my friend arrived.",2.166666667
"I would feel a little annoyed at my friend for not updating me regarding when he or she was going to actually arrive. That said, I would probably start small talk with the people at the party, find some common ground, and maybe make a friend or two. Once my friend arrived, I would rely on him or her to take the majority of the social burden. Then I would probably start to feel more at ease and might be able to actively participate more. I imagine the evening would turn out to be fun despite the minor initial annoyance.",3.166666667
I will just stay back and call my friend and explain about the situation. And ask my friend to call other friends of him who are there in the party and will tell them to accompany me. If not I will come out and stay in my car for my friend to come and will get inside after he comes. If not I will just take a seat and smile at others and will try to talk to them and at times try to go with my socialmedia through my phone.,4.25
"I would call or text them to see where they were at before I would even go inside. If they were on there way and were going to be there in a decent amount of time, I would wait outside for them until they arrived. If they weren't coming, I would just go back home as since I don't know the hosts nor the other people there very well, I doubt that I would enjoy being there. Also, with me not knowing the people there, I would feel extremely awkward there and out of place. Either way, I would feel okay as since I am not a party person, I wouldn't get upset regardless if I went to the party or not.",1.833333333
I would be extremely uncomfortable going to the party in the first place. I would be very annoyed if my friend was not there when I got there. I would probably look for my friends car in the parking lot before I went in. If I did not see my friends car then I would probably wait in the car for her to arrive. If I was waiting too long then I would call her to see where she is. I would definetly not go inside withot her. I would feel nervous and uncomfortable going to this party.,1.416666667
"If I arrived at the party my friend wanted me to attend, only to find that they have not yet arrived, I would be mildly upset. Although, after figuring it out, I would probably start to look around at the party. Walking around I would go and find a drink to make myself and then find some interesting people. Or, perhaps, and actually more likely, I would find if the people hosting the party had a pet, like a dog. If they had a dog, or a cat, I would probably just hang out with their pet until I felt like talking to someone or until my friend arrived. If I walked around and mingled, that would be alright too. I'm not afraid of people, they just generally bore me.",3.416666667
"I would definitely feel awkward and out of place. I would text my friend and tell them to hurry up. I would try to mingle with people the best way I could. I would try to make some simple conversation about my friend that invited me and let them know that they are running late and so they don't think I just crashed the party. I would talk about the food, weather, etc. I would listen to see what others are talking about and try to join in the conversation. I would try to munch on food slowly so it looks like I am doing something and not just standing there.",3.083333333
I would likely wait outside in my car until my friend arrived. This would be a very awkward situation to be in so I really doubt that I would feel comfortable enough to just go inside and introduce myself to a bunch of strangers without having my friend there. I would text my friend and see how long it would be before she arrived and I would just wait outside until she got there. I wish that I had a bigger and more confident personality to just walk inside and start chatting up a bunch of strangers but I don't possess that level of courage or self confidence.,3.166666667
I would feel extremely awkward and nervous. I would observe the room and decide where to try to go and mingle. I would listen to conversations and decide where I would fit in and try to join in. I would at least grab something to drink first. I might even strike up a conversation with someone that is working the event like a bartender. I might even just hide in a corner and send texts to someone that I do know and pretend to be busy. If I don't find anyone to talk to I will feel extremely awkward and out of place until my friend shows up.,2.75
"First of all I would call my friend to check where he is and if he is on the way to the party. If he would be arriving in a few minutes, I would spend sometime texting someone or doing anything else on my mobile. If he was not on the way, I would get into the car and go for a round. But, that kind of situation bothers me and I would be in a bad mood and if the waiting gets too long, I would turn around and go back home.",2.5
"My initial reaction would be panic. I do not like these types of events but I would take a breath and clear my mind then I would apologize for arriving alone and make sure I was welcome to stay and wait for my friend. I would start phoning and finding out what was going on. To relieve anxiety I need details. I would definitely be nervous and apprehensive. I would try not to be annoyed because there could be a legitimate reason the friend was late. Hopefully, the host would be welcoming and offer me a beverage to enjoy while I sat quietly and wait for my friend.",2.583333333
"I get irritated initially. Later, I join in the party with others. I'll introduce myself saying my friend's name. And enjoy the situation if in mood. If I have good mood then enjoy the situation and talk with everyone around there and if it's really entertaining I probably forget my friend. But if I'm in bad mood then I'll get irritated and stay alone in party and often call my friend to check when is he arrive. I never mingle with people in the party if I don't have mood.",3.833333333
Really am not kind to attend unknown people parties at any cause. But when my close friend invite me there sure I will. When I go there if my not there in time I have to handle the situation. But all people over there will be new and strange to me. Sure I feel little lonely and get angry on my friend for she making late. I will try to show myself familiar to the situation. And keep a smile on my face and wait over there for my friend.,3.416666667
I definitely would be ticked off considering the fact that I didn't really want to attend the party in the first place. I would think that my friend would have gone out if the way to make certain that she would be their on time since she knows I'm not familiar with the environment or the crowd. To be honest I'd probably sit alone by myself like a wall flower. I don't consider myself to be a social butterfly and she knows that. Once she arrived I'd nice and politely let her have it. I'd let her know that I'm not happy and I'd probably be her worst nightmare the rest of the night.,3.833333333
I am an introvert with a high level of social anxiety. If I were supposed to meet a friend at a party where I did not know anyone and my friend was late I would most likely hide in the corner until my friend arrived and if they were going to be very late I might even leave without seeing them. If someone were to talk to me though I wouldn't ignore them and would attempt to have a conversation with them and make new friends. It is hard though.,1.666666667
I would totally wait for my friend outside. There is no way in the world that I would go into this party and meet the host who I do not even know. I would literally sit in my car or sit outside until my friend showed up and then I would walk in with her. I would sit outside and beat myself up for being on time. Why do I always have to be on time? Why can't I just be late just like my friend. I feel dumb. I feel lonely. I feel like I am just such an outsider. I am not outgoing and I feel completely out of my element.,1.916666667
"It would be awkward as I am not a social animal. Even though I can make friends easily, however I am not good at initiating the conversation with strangers. I would call my friend and ask him about the time that he would take to reach party. In the meanwhile I would rather go and eat something and also see, if there is any person I might have met earlier in my life. There isn't much I would do except enjoying my drink and food. Once my friend would arrive, I would hope that he would make me meet few guests and we could share some nice thought s.",2.5
"I would try to find someone to talk to and explain that I am waiting for my friend. If I am unsuccessful at first, I would try another person until I found someone I could talk to. I would try to find out this person's interests, whether it be male or female. I might talk about some news of the day but not political news in case I find someone who is very different in opinion from me on that. We might talk about something like sports if it is a man or about recent movies if I am talking to a woman. I might look at my watch from time to time to check on my friend and wonder why he is late.",4.25
"As per the my friend request I go to that party for meet him, I reached there in time before starting the party, It was too cloud lot of high class peoples are attending the party, but I feel lonely at party and I call him he is not answering my call. I become nervous because of that I am not invited for this party but I am here for party from the beginning, I again feel nervous. Bye the time one of party member came and as me that where are you from and how you are invited. I again try to call my friend his mobile was ringing on that time I decided to leave the party.",1.666666667
I would be really pissed and angry if my friend was late and I was standing there left waiting. In fact I don't know if I would stay and wait. I think that I might just leave. This is a party that I was not personaly invited to. I am going as a favor to my friend who knows that I am there as a guest of hers so to speak. I would really be hurt and feel betrayed by my friend. That is not something you should do to a friend who you are doing a favor for. I would definitely have words with me friend when she showed up if in fact I stayed to wait for her.,4.166666667
"I would definitely feel uncomfortable. I would look to see if there was anyone there that I knew. If I found someone, I would just talk to them. If I could not find anyone I would probably get a drink and walk around and try to get a feel for the crowd there. I would look for a small group or someone standing alone and start up small talk with that person. If I found out my friend was running late before I went into the party, I would most likely stay in my car and wait for them to show up.",2.833333333
"While I would have arrived on time, and my friend is now late, I would feel very anxious and nervous because I alone in a place that I am unfamiliar with. It is my nature to be uncomfortable in a setting such as this. I would attempt to contact my friend to see where they are and if they are still coming. But if they are unavailable, I would leave the party and wait in my vehicle or a distance away in order to avoid causing any problems or risk to myself since it wouldn't be safe to do anything else. If this didn't work, then I would avoid returning inside unless my friend came to get me. If they never showed up, I would just go home or have someone I trust to get me.",1.75
if I find that my friend is late I will obviously wait. I will ring up my friend and find out how long will take for him to reach. First I will ask what was the purpose of inviting me to the party. If its going to take less time I would just wait outside instead of joining in. If its going to take more time I will go to some nearby park or restaurant and wait there until my friend arrives. I will keep my friend informed of where I am and ask him to call me once has reached the part venue.,2
I would not even go in if my friend wasn't there. Too awkward and I'm too shy. That would make me nervous. I don't like new crowds like that. What I would do is sit in my car or drive around the block while listening to some music on low volume. I'd try not to be seen. I'd maybe even go get a snack or something from the nearest place. Gas station would work. I wouldn't go to the party without my friend. I'd wait and call him for sure.,2.916666667
I will go into the party and take some soft drinks and sit at someplace and wait for my friend to come. I will look into the arrangement part and observe people so that I can find any people who may I am familiar with. I will call my friend and know the status where he is and how much time will it take to attend the party for him. I will keep myself busy calling or chatting with few other friends and family members. I will listen to music if there is much delay for my friend to come.,3.416666667
"Sure first I check my friend is came or not. If my friend not came sure I will call and ask my friend and know about my friend late situation, If reasonable reason for late, sure I will wait for my friend, at the waiting time sure I will mingle with some other people in that parties, because I am also love some good conversation with good people, so easy I feel mingle with them, still my friend come sure I will speak with any others or like some music, Because I never mind to enjoy without my friend, so sure if my friend came I enjoy otherwise no need to enjoy, this is my mind. Sure if my friend delay over by over, sure I will tell and get ready to go back.",3.333333333
"Well, I am already feeling anxious because I do not like parties and meeting a lot of new people. When I see she is late I first feel irritated and betrayed because I had stretched for her to come, and she can't be on time. I would call her to see what is going on and to find out when she plans on arriving. I then would look for where beverages or alcohol are being served and would get a drink so at least I have something in my hands. AS time went on, I would start to look for a friendly face and consider engaging in conversation.",1.916666667
I would try to call her and see where she is and how much longer she will be. I would wait outside of the party until she got there and if she told me she couldn't make it I would just leave since I don't know anybody there anyways. If she said she was coming I would play on my phone away from the front entrance of the party so I wouldn't look ackward. Once she arrived I would go into the party with her and kind of hang around her until she introduced me to someone I felt comfortable talking to.,1.666666667
I would feel very awkward waiting for my friend. I would also be very mad that they were so late to a party where they invited me knowing I have not met the host. I would try to introduce myself to the host the best way I could and be friendly with anyone that I may come in contact with. I would seek out the nearest bar to get some liquid courage. And then I would rip in to my friend when they arrived. But we would have a great night in the end.,3.083333333
"Well, I might feel out of sorts, maybe I will look out for any possible person I could know to engage and of course it means I will definitely occupy myself with some drinks. While I look out for my friend I will also look out for any person wanting to get comfortable just like myself and maybe I could try start a conversation with them and if not, I will just call me friend to be there without delay. If the people are too strange I can as well exit the function for a nearby coffee shop while I await my friend so we could go back together. I'm sorry I'm not just the croud person not especially when I don't have a particular function in the gathering.",2.583333333
Firstly I will call my friend and ask him when he or she will be reaching the party. If he or she will not be able to make it to the party then I would leave the party and go home. But if he or she will be arriving shortly then I will introduce myself to the host and tell him or her about my situation. I will take some drinks and read some articles on my mobile. I will check any messages or emails on my phone. I will call some family member whom I wanted to call. I will do some online shopping.,2.666666667
"FIRST, I WILL CALL HIM WHEN HE COME TO THE PARTY, I GET TENSED SLIGHTLY WITH HIS LATE ARRIVAL, THEN I TRY TO FIND ANY KNOWN PERSON IN THAT PARTY, AND TRY TO JOIN WITH THEM. IF THERE IS ANY FUNCTIONS, OR PROGRAMS, I MAKE ATTENTION ON THEM. IF NOBODY IS FAMILIAR WITH ME, I TRY TO INTRODUCE MYSELF WITH SOMEBODY INTERESTED ME, I'LL TO MINGLE WITH THEM, IF NOBODY IS INTERESTED, I WILL FIND SOME COMFORTABLE PLACE, AND MAKE ME BUSY WITH MY PHONE- LIKE CALLS, MESSAGES, SOCIAL MEDIA. IF NOTHING IS POSSIBLE I'LL TRY TO RELAX WITH SOME GAMES IN MY PHONE, AND WAIT FOR HIS ARRIVAL.",3.083333333
I would wonder where they were but I would stay at the party. After some waiting I would then contact them via my phone. If they respond fine but if not then I would still hang around and look at the party goers. Then I would go to the food and drinks table and help myself if there is no server. After having some food and a few drinks I would then start to talk to people at the party. If they ask about my I would tell them I was invited and am waiting for my friend. Naming her might help me get some doors opened for me to pursue higher and better things.,3.5
"I would be very uncomfortable. Likely I would wait to enter the party until my friend arrived. I would also be texting them trying to find out why they are late and what their estimated time of arrival would be. If I had already entered the party I would feel uncomfortable. I would scan the room to see if I even slightly recognize anyone or see if anyone looked friendly. If possible, I would stay in the background until my friend arrived. If I was approached by someone, I would try and be friendly. I would want to make a good impression for my friend.",3.25
"I would be pretty annoyed and pretty anxious about it because I don't like being in social situations where I feel that I don't belong. I might head in for a few minutes and get a drink or two and see if I can tolerate waiting for my friend at the party without getting too anxious- maybe I know someone or maybe I can find a corner to stand in or maybe there's a cat I can play with haha. I don't think I'd spend more than 5 minutes in there without my friend unless the situation is a lot better than I expect. I'd go back outside and hang out around the corner at a cafe or even just on the street, and I'd text my friend asking them to meet me outside whenever they get there. I wouldn't hold it against them but I wouldn't be super happy.",2.583333333
I wouldn't really care that much. I am there to support my friend and I don't really care about the party so I would just wait for him or her to arrive and go in to the party with my friend. I would probably text my friend to find out when she would be there and just chill in the car listen to a podcast and smoke some legal weed. That way in wouldn't feel nervous around a bunch of people I don't know. I would get mad people are late all the time and I'm sure she had a good reason maby she was just stuck in traffic or something.,3.75
"I think I will try stay calm when it comes to know he was late to the party. And I get thoughts like he was not genuine and he was not respect to peoples whose waiting for them and I will react him when he is arrived to the party. And try to talk someone to reduce my lonely and talk about whose invited me to the party. May be it was worked for me to talk someone, because may be he know him. But anyway my thoughts are getting irritated by late of him.",3.333333333
"I would look around for people I knew. Depending on who was there, I would go over and talk to them while waiting for my friend to arrive. I would also seek out an alcoholic beverage as it might loosen me up and make me feel friendlier. Barring that, I might also scroll through my phone to look busy. I also have a tendency to wait in line for the bathroom if I am bored or uncomfortable at a party, even if I really don't need to use it. Depending on the length of time that has passed, I may text my friend to find out where she is. I may start setting deadlines Ie, if my friend is not here by this time, I will leave.",3.583333333
I would feel a bit uncomfortable because I do not personally know the host. I would be upset that they are late and not here. I would get something to drink and eat and stand somewhere where there's a large group of people. Then I would try to strike conversation with someone or join in a group and introduce myself. I would try to do my best in order to not just me silent and make friends with everyone. Hopefully this will make time for by faster untill my friend gets to the party.,2.75
"This would be a very awkward situation. I would probably hang out towards the outskirts of the crown and size people up. Once I have a feel for the crowd, I would slowly start to make my way into conversations and introduce myself to others. I would probably work the crowd slowly until my friend arrives. Once he or  she gets there, I would rely on my friend to introduce me to other people. Since I am a stranger to everyone, I would probably not be too forceful in getting into conversations with people, as I am sure they are all wondering who the new guy is in the room.",2.833333333
"I hate being in this situation! I always feel a little betrayed because I went out on a limb for someone and they didn't follow through. First, I would see when they were going to be there. If it was going to be a long time, I would wait outside in my car-- it's super awkward talking to people you don't know, and you feel like an intruder on someone else's good time. If they were going to be there quickly, I'd go inside and mingle with some people, since this party is important to my friend. I'd try to have a drink for myself and possibly a drink ready for them when they got there.",2.583333333
I feel calm to wait for my friend simply sit and I watch the parties because I like to watch and enjoy the situation I want to how they planned for a party how they conducted this curiosity I has after that I like some types of host their style prounciation and styles I like it very much I want to see the party. After that I like lightings and night time climate this gives some energy or mind free relaxation so I am not scold for my friend. Every situation we want to learn one lesson or enjoy the situation.,3.166666667
"I would be freaked out. I don't like to make new friends. I would feel like leaving, but I would stay there. I would text my friend and complain about it. I would text my other friends and tell them what happened. I would talk badly about the friend that is late. I would go outside and act like I am on my phone to avoid people. I would then go find some alchohol to drink so that I would get up the courage to talk to peple that I don't know. I would then walk aroiudn and find someone to talk to until my friend showed up.",2.25
"When I arrive to the party and notice that my friend is not there, I would naturally be disappointed in them since they did not keep their end of the promise. I would also text them and see if they are still planning to come or not. While I wait, I would proceed to enter the party and say that I am a friend of a friend that was invited. If no one was there to formally greet me, I would go ahead and proceed into the party. I would mingle around and get a lay of the land and see if I recognize anyone or find someone I could strike up a conversation with.",4
This would be a tough situation. Initially I would feel quite fearful and nervous. I may ask people online what they think. I may also call my friends to see what they would do in the situation. I would take advice accordingly. I may also exert some self will and just go in there and be honest and let the people know who I am and what I am doing there. I may talk to others to bide some time and get to know the other people. I may also just be patient and wait for my friend. I may also pray on the situation before entering the event.,2.75
I would feel very uncomfortable in this situation. I guess I would feel awkward because of not knowing the people at the party. I would look around and survey the room and the people in it. I might find the place where the drinks are served and at least get a drink. Then I would probably find a spot to stand where I could have a view of the entrance so I would notice when my friend arrived. I would be wishing that my friend would get there soon so I would not feel so out of place.,3
"I'd play it by ear, depending on how long I expect my friend to take before showing up, how much social activity is going on around me, whether I'm noticed and engaged in conversation etc. If my friend is expected to show up within 15 minutes or so, I'd probably keep to myself until then. If there's enough social interaction between other people such that it's clear that I'd be seen as an awkward wallflower for keeping to myself, I'd probably introduce myself to the host and ask what I can do to help. I'd then either help as offered if there is, or use the introduction as a springboard to start interacting with at least one or two other people.",2.333333333
"I would make a call to my friend to let them know I am there and waiting for them. Since I don't know the host I would probably wait outside for a while until my friend arrived. If they say they can't show up due to some unforeseen circumstance, I would go into the party and introduce myself to the host and explain that my friend is not able to come. I would try to make conversation with some of the other guests and find out a little more about them, and let them know who I am and why I am there.",3.416666667
"I would feel frustrated that my friend is late. I would wait outside of the party location standing and looking towards traffic or road to see if my friend's car is showing up. Consistently checking my watch or phone to see how much time has passed. I would also text or call my friend to see where he's at probably every 10 minutes or so. I wouldn't even look towards the party location. Hopefully it is not very cold and I wore warm clothes. I would wait 30 minutes for friend and if my friend doesn't show up, I'd leave.",1.75
"I go to party on time if I see my friend is not there she didn't come on time so I just sit alone and I wait for my friend and I do call to my friend then I call to her I told her to come soon, after that I try to talk other people or I use my mobile to do chit chat with others. Until she comes if she takes more time to come that makes me angry on my friend I do another call to her and ask when you coming and how much time you need. If she says comes in 5 minutes I will wait for her or else I just return to my home from the party.",3.666666667
"I feel some way disturbed. Any way I have to keep my promise. So I will be there for my friend and stay there till he arrives. In the time being, I will try to make friendship with others near by me. I will initiate talk. If it works, then okay. The time will go. If they are not interested, I will try to sit in some corner of the place and keep engage my smart phone. It is a very good friend of me. I can sit there till my friend arrive. It is a good time killer. I always use my smart phone to kill my spare time.",4.416666667
The first thing I would feel once I realize my friend is not there is a combination twang of awkwardness and embarrassment. I have always beenType Apersonality when it comes to hosting someone at an event. I would think to myself what kind of person invites someone to an event but is late. I would then try to find a corner of the room to be by myself. While in that corner I would twiddle away on my phone pretending like I need to check something. Once I saw my friend I would wiggle my way over to them.,2.916666667
"I just talk with the people who are already there and will confirm the event is confirmed or not and it is arranged by the friend invitee. Once I make sure everything clear I will wait until my friend come. I will not get angry instead I will spend some time to entertain in that places, I walk around the places and meet people and talk with them. Meanwhile I will call my friend and inform that I a already arrived and inform him that I am waiting for you only, Once he confirmed that he will come by at what time, I will repeat my process until he arrive. Still I feel happy to attend the party and will enjoy.",3.5
I would feel quite shy and awkward at first since my friend is not there. He is suppose to support me and introduce me as someone he personally invited to the party. I would feel like a complete outcast. I would most likely leave and wait in my car until he arrived so that they don't think I am a weirdo or a stranger so the other people are not uncomfortable. Once my friend arrives I would plan on giving him a piece of my mind so he does not do it again.,3.25
"I feel very disappointed and hesitate. When I visit the venue I first call my friend to check how much will it take to arrive to his party. Till the time he comes I will just talk to the people around me I will introduce myself then I will ask about themselves, I will try to mingle with the people around me. I will ask some random people that how my friend got connected at, I keep the conversation flow till my friend come in to party. Talking to random people I feel very bit shy and I will thought whether other people are comfortable to talk with me or not.",3.083333333
"I would definitely feel awkward and a little embarrassed if I showed up and my friend was not yet at the party. However, I would probably grab a drink and look to make eye contact with someone while I checked my phone and or texted my friend. If possible, I would start up a conversation with someone at the party that I did not know and get to know them a bit prior to my friend arriving at the party. If my friend did not show soon and I was unable to introduce myself to anyone quickly, I would consider leaving the party early.",3.5
"Sometimes the unavoidable happens. For instance recently I got trapped in my garage. Tropical Storm Collin had hit during the night. The electricity went out. I couldn't get my garage door up so I was stuck and going to be late for a meeting. Of course, I had my cell phone in hand and was able to contact the person I was to meet. To avoid keeping someone waiting and wondering, I suggest that you always exchange cell phone numbers with the person in case the unexpected occurs. And make sure your phone is sufficiently charged. I also suggest that you contact the other person the day or the morning before you are to meet to confirm the time and the place.",2.916666667
I feel to bore really. I will wait for him without internet. There is no way to skip the situation. Because he will really expect me on there. If I skip the meeting he will get upset. So I should wait for him at the same time I can't mingle with the party because there is no one knows me and not familiar with the crowd so I will wait for him. I feel so much irritation and upset also but there is a limit for waiting if he take too much time to arrive I will go with too angry.,2.75
"Since I was already inside the party, I would try and mingle with other people by making small talk and introducing myself as the friend of the individual reference. I would definitely feel a little bit awkward since I wouldn't know anyone there but there would be nothing I could do about the situation. I would text my friend to see when they would be arriving to see how long I would be on my own. Once they got there I would stick closer by them and talk with others at the party too. Afterwards I would let my friend know that being late made me very stressed out, and in the future to keep me apprised if they are going to be late.",3.5
I would be at the height of being uncomfortable. I would start to feel hot and nervous. I would make an excuse to go to my car and sit in there until my friend showed up. I would probably call and text them over and over and ask where they were. If I would have stayed in the party I would have gone to the bathroom and stayed in there or if that couldn't happen I'd go to the kitchen or anywhere I could not be noticed. If the people had a dog or cat I would have played with it in a corner somewhere until my friend showed up.,3
"I would feel pretty awkward in this situation. I would try to look for someone I knew, or at least was the slightest familiar with and speak with them. If I couldn't find anyone to talk to, I may wait outside for my friend. I feel like after a few minutes of trying to look for someone, I would wait outside for my friend. I would feel very out of place in this situation. I'd likely be playing on my phone while waiting for my friend. I may even find myself texting or calling my friend, asking when they are going to arrive. I would do whatever I could to try to make the situation less awkward.",2.333333333
"The first thing I would do is make a self-deprecating joke and introduce myself to the host. I have been in similar situations, particularly networking for work, before and am quite comfortable introducing myself and making small talk. I would simply make sure that the host knew that I would be expecting someone and was there as an expected guest. I would likely make my way around to scope out the situation and see if there was anyone in a similar position- I'd be likely to approach them and introduce myself while I waited for my friend to arrive. I wouldn't butt in to any other conversations, but would not feel awkward or uneasy in this situation.",4.416666667
"I'm just going to spend the rest of the night on my phone. I'll just find a quiet area and watch youtube videos or something. I'm not super excited to show up as a stranger at a place full of people who didn't invite me, so I'm just going to mess around in the background until they show up. If they take a while, I might go somewhere else and get something to eat, maybe check in on my friend. I'd see if they're just running late of just not going. I'd hate to spend the entire night there only to find out that my friend was never going to show up anyways.",2.666666667
"I would not be happy about going to the party. As parties are not my idea of having a good time. But, if when I got there and my friend was late, I would say hello to people and have a smile on my face. I would try to look friendly. I would probably get a drink and munch on whatever available food there was. I'd get the drink so it looks like I'm doing something as opposed to just standing there. I would possible start a conversation to with someone who looks friendly.",1.916666667
"I will wait outside for the friend to come since I have no chance of meeting anybody who knows me. After that if the friend is not arriving after long wait, I would tell him to call somebody there and recognize me and take me to the party. And when that happens then I can manage to make some friends there since I am a man who can make friends easily. And also I will contact my friend not to be late again. Actually this is an embarrassing situation for anybody. And even after sometime, he is not reaching there, I will escape from the party without the knowledge of anybody.",3.75
"when I want to attend an important party and my friend also invited to that party and we what to meet each other after a long time, but I don't anybody in that party and feel very nervous and guilty, and I don't feel familiar with the crowd of people will be attending the party, but when my friend was late ill feel some angry on him, because why he was late, and in single in that party, after that he comes ill gives warn to him. And I don't want to like that situation.",2.916666667
"well since I would not know any one at the party, I would feel very awkward and uncomfortable. I would more than likely text my friend and ask them to let me know when they arrive. Until that point, I would more than likely wait inside of my car until they texted me to let me know they were there. Either that, or I would text my friend to let me know when they arrived at the party, and until they texted me, I would wait outisde of the party. Either way I would feel super uncomfortable and awkward as I waited. I would maybe regret going to the party as well.",1.333333333
"I would locate or ask who the host is and introduce myself and say the person who invited me isn't there yet. I may engage in small talk with the host, usually, if they start talking first, or I may tell the host that I'll get a drink or snack if available and mingle about looking for someone I may happen to know. After about 20 minutes, I'll call my friend if he or she hasn't arrived yet. If he or she will not be getting there at all, I'll stay another 10 to 15 minutes unless I run into someone I know. Or happen to be engaged in conversation with someone or an activity there interests me.",1.833333333
"I would feel totally awkward and uncomfortable. I don't know anyone there and I'm a total stranger. Maybe I'll try to go in there and hang out alone and grab a drink or something, but I'll likely wait outside or in my car till the friend arrives. I'd likely be constantly texting or calling the friend asking where he is. I may even just drive away and go to the local market to kill time and arrive a bit later when my friend is already there. I guess while there, I can pick up items for the party as well. This would make me be seen as friendly and sort of help break the ice.",2.583333333
It is one of the uneasy situation for anyone. Because we do not know anyone in the crowd and no one knows about me as well. It is very uncomfortable situation for anyone for that matter. As soon as I reached I try to call my friend and find out what time he could reach the party place. If he comes bit late then I might think to go out and have some cool drinks in order to pass the time. If he can reach the party place withing short period then try to spend the time within that place until my friend arrives. May be I will browse on my mobile or call any of my friend to pass the time.,3.666666667
"I would feel extremely uncomfortable arriving at a party without the one person I am familiar with being there. If possible and if I had not already been spotted, I would leave discreetly without stopping my car and come back a little later, once I'm assured that my friend is there. If already spotted, I would have to go against my nature and go out of my way to start a conversation with strangers, although I feel like I am terrible at making small talk with people I do not know. It would not be fun.",2.333333333
"I would feel a little irritated that my friend wasn't on time, especially if he or she hadn't sent me a text or something to let me know. I generally find it kind of annoying and rude when people are late. I would probably feel a little uncomfortable since I didn't know the group of people at the party. I would definitely want to get a drink while I waited, since I think that could help me feel more comfortable. If there were snacks, I might have a snack too. I would try to meet a few people at the party while I waited.",3.416666667
"I would probably feel awkward at first if I brat my friend to the party. I would do a quick walkthrough the party to see if there if anyone else I might know. If there is, I would go talk to them. If not I would look to see if I can find somewhere to get a drink. If anyone asked who I was I would explain the situation and not linger in conversation. If it was very awkward, I would go to the bathroom and call my friend to see where he was. If it was still going to be a while, I may even leave and drive around until my friend got there.",3
"I would feel a little a little annoid that my friend did not arrive on time and I had to socialize with people I did not know at the party. While I waited I would see if they were serving alcohol and also see what food they are serving too. If I get a little tipsy I might even try to find some hot chick to talk too while I am waiting for my friend to arrive so the night is not shot after all. I can not believe that my friend is late for his own party, if I knew he would be late I might have shown up later so I would not have to deal with the people I did not know.",4.083333333
"I will just wait outside at a nearby cafe or bar till they arrive. I don't think I am comfortable attending by myself especially if I wasn't invited in the first place. I would pre game or chill, I think a cafe would be better and caffeine it up since I always get so sleepy. Touch up my dress and makeup and make sure I look cute and approachable but stylish. I don't think I would be that annoyed with my friend but honestly I think we would of met before hand and attend the party together in the first place instead of arriving separately.",2.916666667
I would feel irritated that they were late after all I did take time of my life to go to this with them. I would mostly stick to myself though I would still make small talk if anyone tried to talk to me. There would be no point in being rude to people just because I didn't know them. I would text or call my friend to see where they are and how long they would be. I would keep myself busy by doing things on my phone while I waited. That way I could at least be doing something instead of just sitting there doing nothing at all but waiting.,1.75
I would call my friend and see what the delay is all about and be sure they are still coming. Then after that I would go inside and introduce myself to the host of the party. I would feel uncomfortable at first but try to mingle. After introducing myself to the host I would go to the refreshment table since that is a good place to meet people. I would get something to drink and see if there is anyone I could chat with at the table. I would then see if they would introduce me around. I would watch closely for my friend until they come.,4.666666667
"Depending on how comfortable and alert I'm feeling that night, I would most likely wait for them outside the door. I'd probably go on my phone for a bit, find out what time they're due to arrive. If it's going to be a while and I'm not comfortable waiting outside, I'd go inside, and try to find any kind of familiar face, or someone who's standing around alone, and approach them to strike up a conversation. I would probably also grab a drink to loosen my inhibitions and find someone to chat up in the meantime. If not, I'd most likely just stand around on my phone until they arrived to introduce me.",3.666666667
"I would feel a little nervous about being there by myself and I would check my phone to see if there's a message from her. If there's not I would send her a message and ask what time she expects she might be there. I would probably go back outside and sit in my car if I drove until I know she has arrived and then we can go in together. If that's not an option, then I would look around the room and move about, making eye contact with people and smiling. I might walk up to someone that's by themselves and start some small talk, introduce myself until my friend arrives.",3.083333333
"I will feel extremely disappointed to see that my friend is late. I will consider it to be an inappropriate and shameful thing to attend a party without an invitation. For the same reason, I will not introduce myself either to the host or to anybody present there. I will look for a quiet place in a corner where people will not notice me. Since I have already reached the venue, I will wait for my friend for some time. I will be looking eagerly at the entrance to see if my friend appears or not. If, even after a reasonable time, my friend doesn't turn up, I will try to contact my friend to check if he or she is coming to the party or not. If I get a yes reply, I will wait further and if the answer is no, I will quietly leave the place unnoticed by others.",3.75
"Knowing that my friend is late, I would probably grab some food if it is available at the party in order to keep myself busy. I would most likely find a not so busy spot in some corner of the house where I would be able to scroll on my phone uninterrupted. If there is a bathroom in site, I would stall for time in the restroom and then text or call my friend about where he is at. If he is still not here after about half an hour, I would go home assuming nobody has approached me to chit chat at that point.",2.166666667
"I avoid situations like this because these things have happened to me in the past. If there were to happen as it has before, I would typically go somewhere in the party where there aren't a lot of people, like a chair or stool on the side and not in the middle of the party. I would also consider going back in my car and waiting for my friend to arrive. If I haven't gotten out of my car and she isn't there yet, I would rather just wait in the car that way I don't have to be awkward.",2.583333333
I will feel bad for myself for arriving for the party before my friend and hesitant to go into the party without my friend. I will try to phone my friend and ask him how long it will take him to arrive at the party and depending on the time I will go for a small walk around the neighborhood till my friend comes and join me. If it will take more than 30 mins then I will probably will go to a coffee shop and have a coffee there and spend time on Social media like Facebook or Instagram while I wait for arrival of my friend.,1.666666667
Since I am not really a big fan of going to parties at all and I am not all that fond of being with people that I do not know at all I would feel really uncomfortable when I became aware of the fact that my friend was late. I would most likely wait in my car until my friend arrived at the party. This type of situation would probably leave me feeling quite anxious since I sometimes struggle to come up with conversation in these types of situations. I become very self conscious and over think everything. If my friend was more than a little bit late I might even leave.,2.416666667
I would feel normal and would not think of anything special about the situation in particular. I would treat it as a fun social gathering and would remain calm and content throughout. I would walk around and mingle with anyone I come across but would not intrude into anyone's way or conversation. I would check up on my friend to see when they would be arriving and would use their absence as an opportunity to meet new people and see what other's have in common with myself and how they may know of my friend.,3.833333333
"Initially I would feel a little awkward, though I would resign that I am there and my friend is coming so I need to make the best of the situation. I would find the host of the party and introduce myself. Then I would make small talk and ask the host if I can be of any assistance or if she. He would mind introducing me to some other people. I suppose I would grab a drink or snack. Then immerse myself within the others at the party. I imagine I would be able to find something in common with the people at the party. And given that it is an important party for my friend maybe say some great things about her to others.",4.333333333
If I got to the party and realize that my friend is not there I would call on the phone and see where they at and how much longer will they be before they get to the party. I would go to the bar and grab a drink or the area they have the drinks. Look around and see if there a familiar face at the party at all. If not maybe talk to a few people or find a table and just chill out and wait on my friend to get there. I will probably take a couple of selfies and pictures of the party that I found interesting.,2.416666667
"I would wait for my friend in the car. I would text my friend and ask what her ETA is and I would not go in by myself. It would be awkward ot go when it's not me who was invited to the party. It would be weird for me to show up without being invited. I would be a little made because my friend is late. I would try to understand though that things happen. However, I would be irritated. When my friend gets there then we can enter the party together.",4.25
"Try to tell loud speech to my friend. After he not see then try to his actions divert. Once he change situation try to sign songs. If not see try to next action. Make any drama divert his vision. Sometimes try to fight. It just so happened he also wondered how I was and what I was up to. After our talk, it's like we never lost a beat. We took some time to bring ourselves up to speed, but we ultimately fixed our friendship. Reflecting on my experiences taught me some valuable lessons about how to fix friendships.",3.166666667
"I as I arrived I will introduce myself to as many people as I can just to be polite and grateful for the invitation I will let the host know who I am and that my friend is late. After the introduction part I will really try to get my self a drink and find a place to seat down for me and my friend that is late. I will probably browse my phone for periods of time just to make the wait feel litter and not get desperate for my friend. I will try to get comfortable in the meantime at the party, after a while I will try to find out what happened to my friend why is he late.",3.583333333
"I would want to impress my friend by working the room and networking. It would make me very uncomfortable, but my will to impress my friend would outweigh that fear. I'd muster up the courage to approach some people most likely women. They're the easiest to talk to for me. I'd ask about their hair or jackets and make general small talk. I'd try to find a group to attach myself to and stick with until my friend showed up. I'd tell them I'm waiting on someone and hope they knew her.",2.75
First I will be blinking but go inside in a hope that some known persons will be there. After going if I find someone I feel like I am more happy and accompany with them till my friend comes if not I will be sitting and watching functions alone. I like to explore peoples how they behave and how they dress up. In India we dress up grandly for finctions with different colors and ornament. I will be seeing it happily. Even if I don't know anyone I will watching others happily with little worry.,3.666666667
"I would hate this situation and honestly, I may leave the party. I am okay around familiar people but I would not feel this way in a party situation where I do not know anyone. I might wait and hover around for a while until my friend would arrive. I try to not arrive at a party or social gathering myself so I would try to avoid this and insist on meeting up with my friend before she arrives. I would also possibly wait in my vehicle until she arritves as well.",2.5
I feel very sad and I have to manage this situation. But I have to wait for my friend. Then I will call my friend through my mobile phone. If he is late after this time then I feel very disappointed. But he is actually a punctuality person. If he late then he have some problems. So I have to manage it. Then I call the mother of my friend and ask about the situation. If it is very important then I adjust. Otherwise I wait for him. If it is emergency then I also leave from the party and go to meet my friend.,3.333333333
"I attend the party after a little late, because the crowd is not familiar to me. Next I after I reached the party place I am in search of persons at least I know around the group of people. If anybody is there I introduce myself and I gather the additional information about the party and major persons of the party leading persons. After I make a call to my friend and know the current position my friends arrival, ask him to reach the place safe and early. I explains the uncomfortable moment around the party place. I make comedown myself and try to mingle with others in overcoming situations. After my friend reach we both mingle the party and discuss the needs.",3.5
"I probably wouldn't even enter the party until I confirm my friend is there. In that case, I wouldn't mind that they were late. But if I had already gone into the party, I would first waste some time in the bathroom. Then I would attempt to act natural and seek out someone I have at least met before, put on my best smile and greet them as if I was thrilled to see them. If that turned awkward I would go back to the bathroom to waste more time and call my friend. If they were going to be more than a few minutes, or I couldn't get in touch with them, I would likely either leave altogether or go sit in my car.",3.583333333
"I am basically scared to be in large crowd. I will be totally irritated to know that my friend not yet arrived on time. So I will come out of the place and look for nearest cafe to wait for some time until my friend reach the party place and call me. Of course I will leave her a message to let her know, I reached and waiting nearby for her. Then wait there for half an hour. If in case, I couldn't find any cafe or resting place nearby, If in case, I couldn't find any cafe or resting place nearby, I will get inside the party hall and try to find someone who can remember me or know my name, if nothing works out, I will start back to my home.",3.333333333
"when I arrived the party, my friend is not there little bit I got irritated and control my self from the situation. I roam around the party and make a smile in my face around the people who are all in the party. Simply I take my phone and watch youtube, facebook, whatsapp and other social networks and enjoy the time. Then I will go to the dining room and eat the foods what I like. Again I repeat the same things as mentioned above until my friend comes. When he comes we make a good conversation and wishes each other and enjoy the party.",3
"I would go in my car and call my friend to find out why she's late and how long she is going to be. I would be pissed off if I had to go into the party to see that she wasn't there. I would be les mad if I could tell she was late but just not seeing her car there yet. I wouldn't be happy that I probably didn't even want to go to the party in the first place, and now she's making me wait. Depending on how late she is and how much longer she's going to be, I may just tell her I'm going home.",4.333333333
I think I will just mingle with others. I actually pretty good in starting a conversation with stranger especially those that I don't have to meet again. I think I will try to see if I could find other people who knows my friend and at least we could have a common topic. If I can't then you can always start talk with others about weather or food. I can also imagine myself perking up my ears and see if there is any conversation going around sounds interesting to join in.,3.333333333
"In such a situation, I would immediately call my friend over the phone and urge him to come as soon as possible. At the same time I try to sit quietly in the venue. I will try to talk about any matter with a smile to those who are as near as possible. In doing so, I would tell them that I was here for my friend, and we would start our conversation and try to be friends with him until my friend arrived. And make sure there is a tense situation when it's time for him to arrive. I would talk to her again over the phone, forcing her to arrive early.",3.916666667
I would feel nervous and apprehensive about going in by myself since I don't know anyone. I always feel awkward and don't do well in conversations if I don't know the people well. I would text my friend to let them know I'm there. I would probably end up waiting in my car listening to music and checking my social media. Hopefully she would show up soon. I don't want people to be staring or wondering who I was and I why I'm there. I usually end up sweaty and very self conscious.,2.166666667
"It depends on how big this party is. If this is a big party, I would probably slink to the back and wait quietly until my friend arrived. If it was a loud party though, I might not even stay. If it was a small gathering though, I would definitely leave. Immediately. I probably wouldn't even go inside unless I confirmed that my friend was already there. And even then, I might ask him or her to come open the door so that I don't have to walk in alone. If my friend was late and didn't show up in the first ten minutes, I would leave regardless of the size of the party. What often happens to me though is that some kind extrovert sees me standing alone and pulls me into a conversation. If that happened, I would join the conversation.",1.75
"I would totally feel awkward in this situation. I do not like trying to get comfortable with new people when I don't have someone I already know there as I'm a very quiet person. I would most likely just wait in my car until my friend arrives, or hang back and just listen to other people until they arrive if I was already inside. I really suck at small talk, so I wouldn't be looking to try and start any conversations as I wouldn't really know what to say at all and would just feel totally weird. If they were going to be too long, I might even just leave.",2.25
I would feel kind of odd showing up to a party that I wasn't really even invited to and where I did not know anyone. I would feel very awkward being there without my friend. I might wait outside in my car until my friend showed up. I would give her a few minutes and then give her a call to see if she was still coming. If I still didn't hear from her a few minutes later I would probably leave the party. It's rude to ask someone to come to a party that they really didn't want to attend and then not show up on time yourself. I would be slightly irritated at my friend for not being there when they said they would be and knowing that they were leaving me in an awkward situation.,3.166666667
"I would probably irritated at first. I tend to be on time and I expect others to be on time as well. I grew up as the youngest child in a house full of older siblings who never cared about my time. I view being late without a good reason to be a kind of passive aggressive act that signals that the person believes they are more important without coming right out and saying it. However, I would probably quickly get over it and consider the possibility that the person was somehow justifiably delayed. And then I would try to make the best of the situation. If it seemed best to wait in a secluded place with introducing myself to the unfamiliar crowd I would probably opt to do that, but if the situation demanded that I introduce myself and meet with the new people myself then I would be comfortable doing that. If that was the case I would do my best to make a good impression for both myself and my friend.",2.25
"When I find my friend not yet reached at the party where I am stranger, first I feel little awkward and sit at one place and call her. Until she arrived I will try to meet the host and introduce myself. I find that host is warm and introduced me to any other guest to enjoy the party. I will try to easy the situation and join the group. Keep waiting for my friend still not came I try to mask my feelings and have some soft drinks and starters. I am not a lover of parties but I am always happy for others when they celebrate any occasion. There is music on the floor dance on the floor I am going to join to mix well in the party.",3.333333333
I would feel awkward going to the party alone that I was not invited to. I would probably sit in my car and wait for them to get there before I went in. I would feel annoyed at my friend because I was there on time and they couldn't be bothered to get there on time. I would think about maybe leaving if my friend was going to be very late because I don't really like parties with a lot of people I don't know anyway. I'd much rather be at home or be spending time with people I already know and like to spend time with.,3.083333333
"I would not feel terribly bad about things. Naturally, I would probabaly head inside to the party and get drinks if drinks were available. If drinks were not available, I would probably browse my phone and look for things to do. I generally tend to find strength from having someone next to me socially, so I don't like engaging someone without someone near me- unless I am intoxicated. Once my friend arrives late, if it was not for a good reason, I would kindly and playfully convince them they either owe me some food, or a drink.",3
"when I realize that my friend didn't reach the party on time, the first thing I will do is to call my friend to know whether he or she is on the way and how long will it take to reach the location. If it will take only a short duration then I will wait outside until he or she arrives for the party. If it seems like it will take more time, then I will check with any nearby coffee shop or something and will wait until he or she arrives for the party. Or if I found anyone which I know inside the party may be I will join them and will explain about my situation and will call my friend to come fast.",3.333333333
"I would feel a tad uncomfortable at first, but I would make an effort to get to know the people at the party. I would search the crowd for any familiar faces because even though I'm not close friends with them, it would give me a chance to get to know them better. I would enjoy getting to know the other party guests and find out if we had any common interests. It would give me a chance to expand my friendships and who know what may come. I would still keep a look out for my friend because I did agree to meet them, so I wouldn't want them to think I wasn't there.",3.833333333
I feel very anxious. But I want to manage this. So I will try to contact my friend through phone. Then I will try to understand the problem about why he is late. If he is in a traffic block. I will wait out side the party area. I feel bored and I will think about how I facce the party people. Because all of them are very strangers to me. So I feel very anxious. If he is more late I will spend my time with my smart phone. I will browse or listen to music. Then I will try to chat with my close friends. I will wait few more minutes then I will leave that place and go for a movie to relax.,3.333333333
"This happens to me a lot, because my best friend loves going to parties but needs me to go as her wingman. She's always late. I just introduce myself to people and get to know them, this doesn't bother me much. I often start conversations with strangers anyways, as I travel a lot alone for work and it's just too boring to go all over hell and not strike up conversations with people. When she arrives, it's great because she doesn't have to introduce me to everyone. She isn't this way at all, and if I'm running late she'll sit in her car. When we're meeting a group at the bar and I get off work earlier than the rest, I hop to the bar and talk to the bartender or whoever is there.",4.083333333
"When I arrive at the party and realize that friend is late, I will call him and ask him to get fast as you can. I will move to the hall and analyze the situation and try to find out anyone who is familiar to me. If no one familiar then I will try to enjoy myself by getting in to the flow of the party and try to mingle with someone who is alone or try to participate with others in their social talk. I will try understand the people and the programmes and try some drink or food if my friend is late.",2.916666667
"When I arrived at the party and realized that my friend is late, I would call my friend to find out what has happend that causes him to be late. I would then check in with the host, introduce myself to the host and let the host knows that I am actually the friend of my friend that has been invited. And I would explain to the host why my friend is late. I would get myself comfortable in the party, make new friends and introduce myself to everyone there.",4.666666667
"In that situation I am feeling very angry on my friend because I am not very familiar with the crowd of people. I am always following timings regularly and I thinks should others also follow timings, I think this is my one of my bad behavior. When I realized that my friend is coming late to the party I felt with lonely and got angered on him, on that situation I spent some time with others friend through a phone call for passing a time. And one important thing is every 10 mins once I make a phone call to my friend for getting the updates where is he now, who is attending a party.",3.5
"I would feel pretty odd and out of place since I didn't know anyone there. I would likely have brought a plate of food or a bottle of wine for the host. So I could use this as some sort of ice breaker to talk to people. I would be nervous but I would at least try to talk to someone. Wine and food are always easy subjects to talk about, especially with other women. I would feel very irritated with my friend that this was an important party and they are late. At this point they are being rude to both myself and the host of the party and I would be pissed about that.",3
First it obvious that I will feel conscious in the party as I don't know anyone in the party then I will try to be comfortable and will smile at people who smiles back to me. I will try to talk to few people who are around me and who try to smile back to me. I will see the party and people around like what they are wearing and how they look as I enjoy seeing the behaviour and dressing of the people. I will wait for my friend and till he comes I will enjoy the drink served on the table.,3.833333333
"I would feel let down a little bit, as I'm socially isolated from the rest of the party. While I waited, I'd drink a little bit to get some liquid courage, and try to blend in with the party or simply look at my phone and wait. I'd call them to see when they were going to get there, and if it would be more than half-an-hour, I'd just call a cab home. My friends are pretty understanding of situations like that, so I know they wouldn't feel like I let them down if I left, since if they were in my shoes, they probably would have done the same thing.",4.25
"Well first of all I will feel very uncomfortable because of him, feeling to know another person and make random questions to know each other is going to be kind of strange. I will go and have a beer with myself and maybe if someone talks to me I will answer back. Then Maybe I can find a girl to talk to feel like I'm invited to the party. Then I will call him in to his cellphone to see where he is at and hurry him up because I feel lonely and not fitting in to the party.",3
It is really a tough situation. I was not interested to attended such a party. If it happened in my life I will be totally upset. I can't face any one in the party. So I will sit quietly and watch everything what is going on there. So No one will notice me. If someone asks about me I will not hide anything. I will tell the truth and wait for my friend. If he or she comes I will tell about his or her misbehaviour. I don't like to continue that party. After sharing my feelings with my friend I will leave from there. In future I will be more careful to choose friends. I will never try to make friendship with such people.,3.166666667
"In this situation I would probably feel extremely anxious when all these strangers were looking at me wondering who I am or why am I here. I would take a deep breath and try to be casual, probably introduce myself to some people and probably explain who my friend is in why I'm here. I would also try to find a drink as soon as possible to help relieve some of my anxiety. I would also feel pretty angry or irritated at my friend for not showing up on time, knowing that I don't know any of these people.",3.333333333
"I would feel very uncomfortable, and would go back to my car to wait a bit for my friend to arrive. If I had access to a cell phone I would contact my friend to see if she was okay and find out if she was still planning to attend and if so when she expected to arrive. If she expected to be arriving soon, I would continue to wait. If she thought she would be a long time I would probably tell her I was just going to go home.",1.5
I would feel a bit awkward and slightly annoyed. When I realize my friend isn't there yet I would step outside to avoid the awkwardness. Then I would attempt to call or text my friend to see how long it will be before they arrive. If I got no response after 15 to 20 minutes I would try to contact them one more time and wait another 5 to 10 minutes. If I still haven't heard from my friend I would leave them a voice mail saying that I'm leaving. I would not trust them in a similar situation in the future.,2.166666667
"I would be quite put out- I am decidedly NOT a social person and not at all good at milling around a crowd of people I don't know. I in fact would simply not do so. I would wait outside, out of sight, until my friend showed up. I would sit in my car, listen to the radio, read a magazine, meditate- anything but go into the party by myself. It is not my nature and I have learned from experience not to put myself in awkward situations because it makes me AND the hosts uncomfortable.",2.166666667
"I hate going to parties where I don't know anyone. It makes me feel very uncomfortable. I would be feeling nervous and unsure of myself. I would probably be texting my friend a lot trying to figure out when they were going to arrive. In the meantime, I would go to the bathroom to waste some time, and then after get myself a drink and sit down in a seat and look at my phone while I waited for my friend. I am just a quiet person, and would never really strike up a conversation with a stranger.",2.333333333
I would feel very uneasy without my friend there. I would not know what to say as an opening statement. I would not know if it would be appropriate to introduce myself. I would be hoping that my friend would arrive soon so that I would not feel so awkward. I would feel as though I were an uninvited guest and a party crash. I would feel like I wanted to get out of the situation as soon as possible. I would wait for somebody else to initiate a conversation with me. I would not know what to do or say until my friend got there and would feel like I have nothing in common with the people at the party.,1.166666667
"I will feel very outrage and out of the crowd. Felt like being left alone in the world of alien. After recovering from the trauma search caused by my friend I first think what can I do next till he shows up and how to make my self comfortable. As the first step wait search in the crowd is there anyone I can mingle with or friendly. I spent some time with others friend through a phone call for passing a time. And one important thing is every 10 mins once I make a phone call to my friend for getting the updates where is he now, who is attending a party.",4
I would probably feel kind of shy at first. I would be feeing a little bit alone and anxious for my friend to arrive. I would probably get something to drink and maybe something to eat. I would probably walk around a little bit and try not to stay in one place for too long. I would be open to talking with people I didn't know and making small talk. I'm pretty good at chatting with people that I don't know. If I were feeling really shy I would take out my phone and text my friend or do something else on my phone.,4.25
"Well, I think I will try to discover and, if I find someone a litlle familiar present in the party, I would make contact with him and tell the situation about the friend that invited me. I also would ask to this familiar person to present me to the party organizer. This could be intersting to waste time while I wait my friend arrive to his important party. While I wait for him, I try to make contact with my friend and ask him why he is not present yet in the party. I would argue him about the importance of that party according to what he tells me before.",3.083333333
"I would feel uneasy and would call my friend to check when he or she would arrive. If they are going to take more than 15 minutes to get to the party, I would most probably go to a coffee shop nearby and have a coffee instead of waiting for them at the venue of the party. If my friend says that he or she will arrive soon, I will wait at the venue. I will most probably be fidgety and keep checking the time on my watch as I wait. I might also scroll through the updates on my smartphone to keep myself engaged.",1.75
"I would feel uneasy since I do not know the host. But at the same time, I would try to look for any common acquaintances of my friend. If I can find such a person, I would try to make that person introduce me to the host. It will help me to get over with the uneasiness. If I cannot meet any acquaintance, I would rather wait outside the party till my friend comes, I will call him to understand when he will reach the party. It more than 30 minutes I have to wait, then I will go out for a walk to kill the time.",3.75
If my friend made a big thing of not going in without them I would try to wait outside but if someone asked or I seemed to be becoming a suspicious person I would just say who I was waiting for. I my friend did not give me strict stay away without me orders I would wait a few minutes then go to the door alone and let the person who answered know my friend's name and that they were late and could I wait inside. I don't see any reason why they would mind. Then I would contact my friend if possible to let them know not to wait for me out front and if I could not contact them and I did not have my own car they would recognize to know I was already there I would ask others and also do my self- to keep an eye ear out for him so he would not look for me outside or think I left.,3.583333333
"I would feel anxious and uncomfortable. I would probably linger awkwardly outside the party for a while and text my friend to see if they were going to be there soon. If they were still fairly far away, I might even go for a walk around the block to kill time before they arrived. If they were going to get to the party fairly soon, I would go inside and introduce myself to the host, and let them know how I know our mutual acquaintance. I would hope they could introduce me to some other people while I waited.",2.75
First of all I will call immediately to my friend and ask how much time do you reach at this venue and I said you told me to reach at 9 and it almost over 9 pm. If you could not reach with in 5 min then I will leave from that spot. In case of my friend phone is taken I will go and sit any places and waiting for my friend and also I am going to finish my dinner with separately. And then I will leave from that place if my friend arrive or not.,3.166666667
"I would feel irritated and bored at the party where I have no known friends. My feelings would be why did I come here or why am I so early here, I should have come a bit late to the party, I would have completed some my tasks at least instead of waiting here among the strangers. I would wait for sometime for my friend simply browsing my phone and keeping myself busy around the unknown crowd. I would start the conversations with people by initiating with a smile. I would try to make friends and try to be comfortable around them. I would find some people who are ideal to me and mingle with them and try to find common friends between us. I would slowly start enjoying the party.",3.333333333
"I would be disappointed that my friend was not there yet, I would look to see if I knew anyone there, if so I would talk to them, if not I would find a quiet corner and try to stay out of the way till my friend got there. I would likely text the friend to see where they were and when the expected to get there. I would be a bit nerves not knowing anyone but it would not be so bad I could not handle it. Depending on what was going on at the party I may try to talk to someone or get some food and something to drink while I was waiting. If the friend did not show in a hour or so I would likely leave. I really don't care for parties and don't really want to be at one where I don't know anyone there.",1.25
I would feel somewhat irritated as I am not a very social person on my own. I would not be too upset though as I understand that things happen to cause people delays. I would probably begin by finding where the alcohol is and grab myself a drink or two to loosen myself up. I would maybe go to the bathroom after and try to kill a few more minutes while I am waiting for my friend to arrive at the party. If they are not there than I would kinda stand around and see if I knew anyone else even if they are just an acquaintance and kill some more time talking to them.,2.25
I will definitely try to call the friend in the phone and try to understand where he is currently now. I will definitely try to avoid contact with the crowd till the friend arrives. If the friend is not picking up the phone or if he says he will be late by a significant time will clear the party area immediately and try to find a place where I can sit alone. During that time I will call close friends and inquire about there well being. Might use Facebook or you tube in phone to spend some time. And will only return to party if the friend arrives.,3
"I would be extremely on edge, as I do not do well with people I don't know. I would be angry with my friend for putting me in a situation where I now have to fend for myself in an environment where I do not know anyone. I would, of course, introduce myself to the host and briefly explain that I was invited by my friend, so that the host can make the connection as to why I am at the function. I would attempt to mingle and make small talk with other guests as appropriate and as opportunity allowed. Once my friend arrived, I would say hello and be pleasant, but once I had an opportunity to speak privately, I would express my extreme displeasure at having been put in a position of having to interact with strangers.",2.25
I feel so awkward because I don't know anyone who are in the party. I call him and tell him to come as soon as possible because I do not know anyone over here. But meanwhile I try to enjoy the party. I try to make friends and have drink and food. I am not good at making friends easily but I try it surely. If he will take so much time to come I will sit somewhere and surf my mobile. I have never be tired with my phone so I will so something interesting in my phone and try to enjoy the party as well.,3.25
"I would feel totally out of place. I am not good at interacting with people that I don't know. I would go to the bar and grab a drink, Then I would walk around and see if there was anyone there that I knew. Odds are long that I would find someone to talk to so I would probably try to find an empty seat at the bar. I would text my friend to see where she was at. If she was on her way I would stay there and have a few more drinks. If she wasn't going to make it I would leave.",1.666666667
This kind of circumstances might arise me in my previous years. This kind of incident is happen during our travel time I. E in the bus stop. But this is in the party. This party is very important for my friend. My friend may be late for some reason. I think there must be some friends which I know earlier because it my friend's party. I am waiting for him or her. Even though this situation is very critical for me but we must wait for her because he or she is my friend. I wait for them otherwise simply I sit and watch anybody from my friend circle may come. If someone has come I talk to them and wait for my friend otherwise I simply sit. But whenever my friend came I informed him or her about my situation. After that we may forget it and enjoy the party.,3.666666667
I would feel incredibly uneasy and uncomfortable. I would probably make up a reason to excuse myself and probably try to go outside. Then I would get on my phone and call or text my friend to see where they were. I would probably try to make myself look busy by texting my friend or making it look like I was doing something on my phone until my friend was finally able to make it there. I would try to avoid talking to other people or being around them until my friend arrived.,1.333333333
"First of all, I will call my friend to ask where he or she is, then wait for him or her at the corner. If someone approach me to find out about me then I will talk to the person and tell him that I am waiting for my friend who is invited here in the party. I try to get along with the person who approach me for the communication. I may feel little hesitant in the beginning but I am sure that I can manage to talk with few people by the time my friend comes to the party.",3.833333333
"It would really be en embarrassing situation. Most likely I would sit in a corner or at one particular place and do not interact much with others. I will wait for my friend to arrive to mingle with the crowd. I will go through my mobile and read some news or watch some videos to spend time. It really feels bad to interact with people whom I never knew before and attend a party for which I am not invited unless I have a common friend. I will try to see if I know anyone from the crowd and try to interact with the known person. If not, I will stay quiet.",3.166666667
"I will to do the party, and wait for the friend. Meanwhile I will find anyone that I know, Also I will introduce myself to the host. If did not find anybody will go for drink. Also will look for any solo person or who look like they'd be open to someone else joining in. If the person I introduced myself to doesn't seem interested in talking with me, or I just run out of things to talk about, Will Make an excuse refill your drink, get some more snacks, go to the bathroom, say hi to someone else, etc and repeat with a new person.",3.833333333
"The friend under scanner will start losing the status of friend fast. I would rather start doubting about the intentions of my friend. While feeling lonely and embarrassed, I would curse myself for putting myself into a social situation that is uncomfortable and could have been avoided. Maybe,I will leave the space in silence without making any one aware. The best part is since all are strangers, getting a silent exit should be an easy task. Going forward, I would make sure that I rely less and less on the friend who has acted in an irresponsible manner.",1.833333333
