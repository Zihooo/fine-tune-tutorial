5254,913632.txt,P5,DEU,high,"In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
What will happen with the development of cars ?
Will the amount of driving cars in 2030 increase or decrease ?

Let 's take a short look on the fast development of cars .
They were invented in about the 1920s and became more and more popular for all people all over the world within the last century .

Nowadays , it is unbelieveable not to have car or a possibility to lend one , if you need one .
People got used to their drivable possibility to get from point A to point B whenever they want to and how often they want to .
They do n't depend on any busses , trains or even flights .
Even think of the high taxes and fees one has to pay if he uses any public traffics .

Beside the fact , a car is one 's chance to get form A to B , a car enables you to feel free and independent .
If you want to go on vacation , get your car ready and leave your homecountry .
But this , unfortunately , is luxuary , especially in times like this when oil-price is as high as it has never been before .
One has to effort his or her car .
Having a car , turns out to be a question of money and the possibility to effort it .
It 'll be senseless , to spend all your loan on gas , would n't it ? !

Furthermore , the amount of gas that pollutions the air everyday , every minute , exactly every second , is still rising and does n't seem to get less in future .
Although there are several techniqual developments and inventions , it 'll be a problem and influences the environment a lot .

What will be in about 20 years ?
Will people think about this facts and problems and turn into another development of enviromental and social thinking ?
Will there be a chance to be fewer cars used than they are today ?
In my opinion , I do n't believe in this solution , being fewer cars in 2030 than they are now .
People more and more get selfish , always want the best and newest version of an invention ( car ) and they probably will change a certain way of group , social and enviromental thinking but they wo n't change their behavior towards car-using .

In my opinion , there are only two things that will lead a change in the amount of cars used .
First the changing of laws by the government enforcing people to fullfill certain policies in car using ( such as car sharing , car-free days , etc . )
and second if the oil price is still increasing !

2466,427905.txt,P2,FRA,high,"Do young people really enjoy life more then older people do ?
Being a young person I cannot say that I 've experienced old age , and this makes the question all the more difficult to answer .
However when I hear about all attempts to try and remain young , with skin care products or even people selling their soul to the devil in exchange for eternal youth , I ca n't help but assume that being young truly is the most enjoyable age group .
Why would people fear old age otherwise ?
When I consider all the things I can do but my grandpa ca n't , I really do consider myself to be lucky .
I can play soccer , run around all day , eat thousands of calories without taking a pound but he can barely get off the couch to eat his soup .
I 'm constantly discovering the world and participating in it 's development but old people live in the past loosing themselves in deja-vus ...
Is this however only what makes us truly happy ?
Physical well being cannot only be the source to happyness .

Old people appreciate what has been done , they are proud of their accomplishments .
They get to see their familly grow , watch their children become parents , and grandchildren grow slowly taller then they are .
Older people do not have to worry about the mundane and often supperficial preocupations of a teenager .
Old people get to look forward to retiering , young people only the unfortunate prospect of a lifetime of work ...

How can someone judge happyness to be a inverse relation of age ?
Older people and young people just as they have different problems , can also have different ways of percieving joy .
I think it would be using a very limited perspective if we only took into account our steriotypical criteria .
Can the thrill of playing a hard fought game of soccer not be compared to the blissfulness of tranquillity ?

8775,1386341.txt,P8,ZHO,medium,"In recent years , our society is growing very fast .
Many new things have occured and many old things were eliminated .
The reson why it is because people are trying to do new things and do something which they have never tried before rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .

Firstly , I believe the sentence `` no pain no gain '' .
The sentence shows that people need to sacrifice something in order to gain what they expected , especially taking risks .
Obviously , business man tends to produce new products in order to gain more profit .
But the things is , they need to take a high risk and try things they have never tried before .
They must have the courage to do some risky things .
I do n't think they would continuoulsy doing the old things and having an `` old '' return .
That 's are the main reasons why they become successful .

Secondly , I have heard about a theory `` high risk equals to high reuturn '' .
Take students as an instance .
The top students often spend a lot of time on their studies , they devoted themself for sacrificing their spare time and souls into studies .
I believe they know that theory very well .
The reson why they keep doing that is , they know they will have a good return for what they did .

Last but not least , successful people try to invent new things and doing new things .
We can actually tell why the scientist are so successful on their performance to their works .
It is because they know that if they try to do things that no body has done before , they will eventully become successful people by the honor given by the public .

In conclusion , I think courage and patient are the two essential thing to become successful .
Successful people require these two elements , and they need them more that anybody in the world .
that why they are successed .

3413,591457.txt,P8,TUR,high,"Some may argue that successful people do n't try new things meaning that they do n't take any risks in the life .
However , I disagree with this opinion and for some reasons I beleive that one should take risks in order to be successful in the life .

First of all , trying new things develops one 's imagination and creativity .
In other words doing the things which we already know brings ordinarity and make people 's life monoton .
I think , imagination and creativity plays very important role in being successful .
Only if you have some extraordinary imagination and creativity you can succeed .
I wolud like to qoute from Albert Einstein saying `` Imagination is more important than knowledge , knowledge is limited but imagination encirles the world . ''

On the other hand , the life itself , I beleive , is a risk .
No one can know for sure what tomorrow will bring .
So , if we are living in a risky life , then , it is unnecessary to hesitiate to take some risks in the life .
By taking risks , people increases their chances of finding new opportunies to make their lifes more enjoyable , confortable and desirable .
I think , most of the successful people taking risks beacuse of the invevitability of risks .

Thirdly , no one can know what something new will bring without trying it .
I mean , of course , while something new will have both negative and positive effects , not to trying it restricts the probability of getting the positive side .
I beleive that making some preliminary studies , I mean thinking , one can easily take risks in the sake of getting the positive sides .

For these reasons I stated above , I am of the opinon that successful people try new things and take risks in the life .

9457,1520690.txt,P7,FRA,medium,"I do agree with the statement .
But I have to moderate my claim .
Coming out of the University , I can see I have learn a lot of things , and I have forgotten an equal number of it .
What will stay after passed years ?
The ideas , and the concepts .
In courses , it , s really important to learn a way to think .
Not the same as the professor 's one , but its own one guided by teachers experience .

So , is the knowledge unusefull ?
Certainly not .
In order to develop his own way to learn , the student needs strong basis .
If he does n't have good instalements , his science building is going to fail .
In the elementary school , we already have to set up those strong basis .
Otherwise , the only way to build up a good mental structure is to receive examples to learn .
How to understand a car is riding without knowing how works an engine .
The knowledge is also important to be able to make connections between different areas , to compare some stuffs .
As an archeologist discovering some news objects .
He needs to know how was the environment , the atmosphere to figure out how those objects could be usefull for peoples who lived there .

In Belgium , we have this big issue in the high school level .
Actually , we try to reduce the knowledge of students and to give us more skills an abilities .
But the college professors start to mean their students come into their courses with too big lakes .
So , there is an emergency in finding the best middle way between pure knowledge and skills .
I think that the more we grow up , the more we have to leave knowledge to get a lot of abilities and concept .
At the and of college , student get very various jobs and have to learn again what is typically needed for their domains .
So we never stopped to learn , and college is there to give us concpets .

2951,511877.txt,P8,JPN,medium,"I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what already know how to do well .
There are two reasons .
First , when high school student , I attended boxing club .
In practicing , I prefered to weaker people to fight with , because it easy way to improve my technic without pain .
In other words , I was ordinary boxer and could not win at big competitons .
On the other hand , one of our club member tried to fight with stronger person than he is everytime .
I think he tried new things which is risky to become strong boxer .
Finally , he won a big competiton and be chosen as a Japan 's representate boxer .

Second , the president of Microsoft corporation dropped off his school and focused on a new technology .
Although it is challenge , if he failed , he loses good oppotunity for prestige since his university is well known for reserch and study .
He invented new programs and it spread out all over the wolrd nowadays and is the world richest person of this year .

In conclusion , at least these two successful persons challenged new styles and found their styles .
It derives from taking risk somehow , So I regard that people who achieve something have tendency of challenging new things and taking risks .

1803,311318.txt,P3,SPA,high,"First of all I would like to write that I am in complete agreement with the statement .
Let me say some of the reasons that support my decision : Since there are more innovations and new thing coming in , the young peolpe spend their time doing things that in the near future do not contribute with the development of their community .

As an example I would like to say some examples about what the young peolple of my country do at the moment and what the young peolple did before .

I remembered when I was at the school , the teachers took us to different places of the city in order to do social activities with the poor people , we braught them food , toys , clothes , and it was really satisfactory for all of us .
In addition to all this activities , at the end of the school , I mean in the last year , we had to do a social project whit the community and it was a part of the grades at the end of the year , but anyway we did that for other reasons ... `` help the people '' .
However , after to have finished the school , I still carry on with this kind of activities and some of friends also do that yet .

On the other hand , when I look at the young people now , I get surpriesed how the life change and how the activities that we used to do it before do not exist right now .
What the zoug people are interested in ? ...
Go to the disco , play x/box , playstation , internet , watching T.V , etc. and some others activities that do not contribute with the integral formation of the person .
I think that much of the behaviours the young people have , are coming from the rapidly change of the world .
However we can not forget that we do not live alone , we live with other people that probably need our help and we have not realised yet ..
"
3162,548894.txt,P8,DEU,high,"I agree with the statement because I believe , that we would not live in the world of today if it were n't for men and women who had the courage to leave their old jobs behind and start something new .

To begin with , we all profit from those extraordinary men and women who have dedicated their lives to try new things and take risks rather then enjoying the merits they could have had by doing their normal jobs .
Every successful woman or man today could not have been that successful if it was n't for the pioneers in the past .
Although it takes a lot of courage to take a risk , the chances of being really successful are much higher too .
If one is dedicated and puts all his passion into one idea or thought , the chances that he might be succesfull will increase a lot .

This point can be illustrated by taking an example from history .
In todays world we all profit from the high mobility which is made possible by cars , and even more so , by planes .
But it took two brothers in 1903 all their courage and money to construct an absolutely new type of vehicle and to test it themselves .
Their risk was a high one , but their success was even higher and can be seen everyday in today 's world .

This is only one example of how we profit of those people who chose not to live a cozy and unspectacular life , but to dare something .
I am not saying , that everybody needs to try to invent something new and be innovative , but a certain percentage of those pioneers is needed to strengthen the innovative process which underlies economic growth .

In conclusion we can see the enormous importance of pioneers and how no country can go without them .
Everybody will profit from the advantages those innovations will bring for a society .
Thus , a government should always support those people who take risks since their innovations are the basis for a better world tomorrow .

2290,395784.txt,P4,TUR,high,"I agree that most advertisements ignore their actual purpose and work for making products seem better than they actually are .
However , in today 's world , where advertising has become a sector on its own and where companies compete to produce the most creative advertisements and attract the most number of potential buyers , it is not a given that just because an advertisement has been made , it will create a better image in peoples ' minds than the product itself .

While watching televison , we are exposed to numerous different advertisments and we are inevitably influenced by what is being promoted on the screen .
However , in my opinion , this same fact is one of the most important reasons why the impact of such advertisements on people are decreasing everyday .
It is the nature of human beings to get used to occasions which they have experienced numerous times .
Hence , people have been very well acquainted with advertisements of varying types and do not perceive them as they used to perceive many years ago when there were n't so many options .

I belive that the given statement is true only if we change the phrase `` most advertisements '' to `` few advertisements '' .
Even though today 's advertisements still exaggerate the actual features of the promoted products , most of them do not bear the effect of actually misleading people to go out and buy such product .
For example , if we think of a shampoo advertisement , where a girl washes her hair with the promoted product and her hair suddenly starts to shine , we can definitely say that the products seems better than it really is , however such an advertisement is so common on the screens that it is no longer believable to most people .

In conclusion , I do believe that advertisements may hav

1741,298412.txt,P7,DEU,high,"I agree entirely with the opinion that it is more vital for students to comprehend ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn mere facts .

Why study facts , or even worse , learn them by heart to pass final examinations when you will forget most of them shortly afterwards , anyway ?
Therefore , it can be far more beneficial to focus on teaching the general understanding of ideas and concepts .
Research in psychology has proven that you will remember far more easily anything you have understood instead of learning it by heart .
And normally , you learn facts by heart because there is not much to understand .

Moreover , in an increasingly dynamic environment , both in professional and private terms , the learning of facts could be in vain .
Circumstances change more and more rapidly .
What was important to know now could be replaced by completely other facts who have to know in a couple of years .
That is the case , for instance , if you have to change your profession as a result of structural change of the employment market .
As a matter of fact , experts say that these kind of structural changes will occur more and more frequently , so many people actually will have to change their profession several times during their life .

The understanding of ideas and concepts can also be helpful in any profession as it offers a larger flexibility .
You cannot study all kind of solutions to a problem by learning facts .
Because the problem is , that as a student you cannot possibly know what kind of concrete problems you will have to face later on in life .
As a result , it is far more important that you learn and train a certain approach to solve problems , by concentrating on studying major ideas and general concepts instead of investing too much time into learning facts .

In conclusion , I would like to state again that the understanding of ideas and concepts is more important because it is in every respect more beneficial to the preparation for a increasingly dynamic environment .
It is easier to remember ideas and concepts than it is to remember facts and , last not least , ideas and concepts are more useful as they allow are larger flexibility to new challenges .

4573,793071.txt,P2,ITA,medium,"First of all i do not agree with the statement which says that young people enjoy their life more than older peolple .
I think that the way to enjoy life is different but this not imply what the statement says .

Today young people can enjoy in several ways , respect one or two generations ago because is permited almost everything : for example have the car very early , to go out every weekend and spend a lot of money to take drinks and to go to the disco with some friends .

They can also enjoy themself organizing some party between compains of school or university .
A friend of mine told me that he went to Danmark as erasmus student and he descibed me that experience as a beautiful thing .
Every day he enjoyed his life going to erasmus party that took place almost every evening in the university place .
He told me also that the mainly enjoy it was the beer and the disco .

In stead , the fact that the older persons do not do the same things it does not mean that they enjoy less : they have only other interestes .
The major part of older persons are married and for this reason the prefer enjoy their free time going , for example , to the cinema to watch a particular film , or to go to the restaurant for a romantic dinner .
Of course many older people could have son or daughter and this imply that they do not have the same time respect the young people , to spend for enjoy themself .

The have to do a lot of thing into house and at the work .

3688,642012.txt,P7,ARA,medium,"Actually I disagree , Since learning facts is the main part of building an idias or concepts , which will be reflected on the amount of facts they learned .
The much you learn and study about facts and information , The much the clear idias will be ready to speak out about .
Many people sponsered an idais that do not stand or reflect any facts , These will be very fragil and will not found any field of practice since its not factual concepts .
So in order to be in the way of good learning way we have to make sure we study the important basics and learn more facts in order to be able and more confedent to have a new idia and getting more advance in the field of knowledge .

For me , understanding idias is secondary to learning the other part of facts and information since not all idias are correct or in other way it is still a theory rather than approved facts , So concentrating on this veiw of teaching the student will be more important to be in the side of producing a logical and practical type of mentality and getting more beneficial idias as we reflecting all on facts and concepts .

Further the more , It is really interesting to explain that facts and concepts are only the way to understand all idias as with out these facts we can not progress to a matter of making theories and adopting a new concept in any field of life .

Students are more willing to learn when they feel they are standing on a solid base that help them to understand more idias and they can learn fast when they feel more confortable with the way of getting the informatin and this will be through learning facts first the understanding the concepts .

4040,700825.txt,P7,ITA,high,"I believe that facts can be learned in many different ways and that school has a different object than teaching students facts .
A school 's duty is to both prepare the student for his entrance in real life , and to open a student 's mind through the constant teaching of concepts and ideas everytime more difficult .

Facts must be examined and fully explored in order to understand what lies beneath them .
Facts are nothing more then the final chapter of many causes put together .
Why birds migrate every year , why people cry when they are sad or why the sky is clear or cloudy ?
All of these questions could not be answered only by observation .
The laws of cause and effect studied during the past centuries explain us the importance to know the basic concepts that rule the world .
Every phenomenon , every situation or consequence come from a precise cause .
If we can know that cause then we are able to control the consequence , weather we want to repete it or avoid it .

I believe that the primary objective of universities , or schools in general , is to give to their scholars as many informations as possible .
Then , it will be the studient who will decide how to use these informations .
Facts can teach you many things , they can show you all the possibile outcomes for every event , and they can help you to predict the future based on previous episodes .
But facts alone , I believe , can not be consider enough for somebody 's growth .

8763,1384177.txt,P8,TEL,low,"I agree with the statement `` sucessful people try new things and take new risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do '' , because a successful person may have confidence which may not there in unsuccessful person .
By this confidence they take risks and also works harder to get success .
Avoiding pressure is the one of the important factor for a person to acheive success , but the unsuccessful persons are in pressure which leads them not to do risks at that period .
A successful may ovecome the pressure which is not possible for a unsuccessful person .

For example , consider business people , the person who gains profit in bussiness may try to do risks by perfoming different plans .
These people can withstand for any type of result that may give profit or loss , but the person who is in loss will never try to do risks as the reason that he may face loss if the plan gives negative result which leads the person to huge ammount of loss .

A successful person always need more success which leads In my conclusion , it is not possible for a unsuccessful person to do risks as a successful person can do .

If you believe everything what the producers say and what they sale then maybe you think that you buy the best product .

For example in politics , during the election , most of the electors vote for the candidate with the best advertisement .
Though they even know their ambitions .
So the politicians waste most of their money to emphasize their popularity .

7127,1126521.txt,P7,SPA,medium,"I agree with the statement that says that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
First , if I go back in time and I start to do some memories of my time as an students at School and at the University , all those things that I learned it was because I understood the ideas and concepts that my teachers explained to me and my classmates .
When I finally understood the process of the French Revolution I never forget it , because I did n't learned it as a fact .

Second , is really great when you get the concepts of the different things and you can start to make some interesting relations between them and with the experience of your own life .
I think that is nice when you can make questions about what you learned and give some conclutions about it .
I also found that is nice when you meet with friends and you start a conversation with them , talking and exchanging ideas of all those things that in a moment you learned and understand them .
I really have a very good time when I have those kind of opportunities to share with friends what I have learned and also to be sure that I can do my own statements .

Futhermore , I consider that Facts are too weak , you learn this facts for the test and then you erase them .
Is like a foreing learning , from one moment to onother it flyes away , from your mind .
Instead , when you really understand the ideas or concepts yo can be sure that this knowlege will never forget , never more .

Finally I can say that , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
"
11090,1818610.txt,P7,SPA,high,"I believe learning ideas and concepts is far more rewarding for students than only learning a bunch of meaningless facts .
Specially as the student start to progress in his knowledge , ideas and concepts should become more and more relevant than facts alone .

Even though the normal process to reach a concept or idea requires us to learn facts before understanding them , it is clearly of higher importance to understand the concept as whole .
In fact , understanding the concepts is the only way to apply all the facts we learn .

For instance , in my working experience I have noticed how two different persons aproach problems .
The first one tries to memorize the solutions and does not care about the underling reasons of the problem .
The second one reaserches the facts for the superior task of understanding the problem as a whole .
Clearly the second one always comes with new and suported ideas on how to resolve the situation , however , the first one is always talking about specific information that does not help the solution at all .

Another example of the higher importance understanding ideas have over learning facts is the following .
When there is a complete understanding of the concept you can apply the same concept to a similar situation regardless of the different facts you may encounter .
Addittionally , the sum of ideas and concept can even form a more complete and complex reasoning for a wide variety of situations .
On the contrary , the sum of facts would not lead us to the same aplication regarding diferent situations .

The fact that ideas and concepts are of higher value is the only fact students should have on their minds as they progress in their knowledge .
I definatly believe it is more important for studentes to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

It is because that there are lots of things which we want to know in the world .
If we only do well on something we have already known , we may lose our abilities such as thinking .
We also should try new things instead of doing the same things in our lives .

To improve our lives , some inventors make plenty of products which are useful .

614,106007.txt,P3,DEU,high,"I agree with the statement , that young people do not give enough time helping their communities .
An article in a German magazine said , that today we live in a world of interships .
Whenever you have free time , you have to spend it sensible , which means by spending it in a way , that it looks good on your curriculum vitae .
Working in your community , helping old people for example , might look good on your CV because by that you can show your social skills .
But if that community work is senseless for your further professional life , you will not do it bacause there is no use for you .
That is how it works today .
Everything you do has to have a sense for your own future .
So if you want to proof your social skills , you would probably prefer picking out an internship or any other service , that is more linked with your future working goal .

One reason for this way of deciding , what to do , is competition .
In my opinion we live in a world of competition .
Not only in school or university , everyone is competing , whether it concerns your schoolmarks or your ability to make new friends .
Everything is a question of competition .

If you plan to work in your community in the future , helping your community is a possibility of raising your chance of getting a job later .
But because of competing against everybody around you , it is kind of out of fashion just to help somewhere out without getting a piece of paper , that says what you have done .

Maybe there are some people , who help their community without expecting to get a document afterwards but I think , this might only be few .
Further there might be persons who would like to hepl , but do not have the time to do so because of their professional life for example .

Helping in fact means , doing something without a reward .
Nobody I know has the time left to do something without getting a reward .

So I guess there are quite a lot of different reasons , wheather it is their profession , their goals or their opinion by not wanting to help their community because people think , nobody would help them , there are not many people left who actually help their community .
And I do not believe , that the number of people , who are willing to help will increase in the future .

It 's true that sometimes it 's more economical to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
For example , for those people who are busy with their work and hardly can they spare their time to take a trip , find a travel agency and with a tour guide is a great idea .
Because they do n't have any time to plan their own trip .
But they may not have so much fun as those people who travel alone .

Traveling without a tour guide may be a challenging for me .
Because I am not a person who are afraid of challenge .

As far as I am concerned , traveling without a tour guild can provide me with more pleasure .
By traveling alone , I can also learn how to take the responsibility and be independent of my parents .
I had this experience when I was in elementary school , I along with my sister took a trip to Hawaii without my parent 's company .
At first , I was so scared to go to a totally strange place .
But after a few days , I found myself enjoying in it .
I thought language would be my biggest problem .
To my astonishment , I can chat with a foreign .
Moreover .
I made progress by leaps and bounds .
I also learned the history their by reading the book .
I never knew traveling alone allow me to learn so many things .
I also had the experience traveled in a group led by a tour guide .
But I found it was not an active way to travel .
In other words , they maneged everything for you .
Besides , I almost had no free time .
Although I really liked those people who traveled with me , by the time we arrived at the airport , everyone had had their own lives to go on .

In conclusion , I disagree with the statement not only because I find it 's much more fun without a tour guide but because I learn much more than a tour guide can teach me .

11570,1901524.txt,P7,JPN,medium,"Students have variety oppotunities to learn not only understand ideas and comcepts but also fact .
Concepts are important element for students , however I believe that It is more important for students to learn form fact .

First , throughout real expericences student can growth and understand .
For instance , many people know what death .
However , if people have never met death itself , they cannot understand what the death meaning correctly .
According to my experience , when i heard that somebody passed away , who i do n't know well , i feel sad but that it because i just understand in my head .
On the contrast , when i went to funeral and i met their family or friends and saw their faces , then i noticed about the death 's meaning .

Secondary , there are many students have a chance to live thierselves when they go to university or college .
At that time they know how do they live .
Money is the good example .
When they live with their parents , they know concepts of money but it is not too much taking care of it .
However , when they start to live by themselves they realize how is life going on .
they have to think about thier meals , living costs , leisures , and studying .
They can only learn form facts about that , not from ideas .

Finally , support to each other learns from the facts .
we know how much friends important , or how much family is helpful , and there are coming from not concepts but facts .
If they understanding to help each other is important in thire head , they ca n't support anybody .
From friends , teachres , family support them and when they accept those facts , they can support other people .

We need more thoughtful idea , opinion , concepts and if we lack of those ideas we may not learn well .
Besides , learing from the facts is more important for st

1756,302276.txt,P3,HIN,medium,"I disagree with the given statement .
In my opinion , young people do their best to help their community and society .
I can say this with conviction because I myself have done my best to help society .

My grandmother runs a primary school for children with limited means .
Since I was about ten years old , I have been going to this school every summer to do voluteer work .
I have interacted with the children , played games like soccer and cricket with them , taught them extra-curricular activities like dance and painting and even taught the children younger to me academic subjects like math sometimes .
It is a great feeling to be able to give to somone something so important - education .
Some of the children there became my friends and I still do talk to them .
Some of them are in high school now .

My brother too has been doing his bit for the society .
He goes to old age homes .
He interacts with the old people there and reads stories to them .
They are lonely and need someone to talk to .
They feel extremely touched when young children like my brother take out time to come and meet them .
My brother too loves to go and spend time with them .

Many of my friends are into community service as well .
A very good friend of mine , Julia , works closely with mentally challenged patients .
She is also an active volunteer for a school with mentally challenged students .

So , in my opinion , it will not be entirely correct to say that young people do not take out enough time to help their communities .
I do agree that there are exceptions this , that there are people who do not wish to indulge in community service .
However , they are mere exceptions .

6450,1064149.txt,P5,DEU,high,"Today almost evey adult has a car .
Most people use their car eveyday , for essential things such as going to work or driving to a supermarket to buy food .
A car is an element of daily life .

Of course in cities where there is a good public transport system , people do not need a car for their daily life .
But in more rural areas or cities where puplic transport is not very effective , there is the need of cars .

Reasons to reduce the number of cars are to protect the environment and the fact that cars and fuel are getting more and more expensive .
Maybe in some years there are no more as many people as today who can afford a car .

On the other hand there is the fact that business and working life gets more and more flexible , spontaneous and individal , and the need to get to a specific place in a short time increases .
And we should not forget the industrial branches that produce cars .

Weighing these points , I came to the conclusion that I do not think the number of cars will decrease .
I want to point out that I think it would be a better development for life on earth if there would be fewer cars in twenty years , but I do not think this will happen .

Today industry that produces cars is still a growing business , and I cannot imagine that this would change in the next few decades .
I study geodesy , and something that I could do later is developing navigation systems .
An example where navigation system are commonly used is in cars .
Many people and companies work and research for new developments in cars and components for cars .
So I do not see a financial reason why fewer cars should be produced in twenty years .

To sum up I want to say that I would be very happy if there were fewer cars in twenty years .
The reason for this opinion is the protection of nature and the environment and to reduce pollution caused by cars .
But I do not think this will happen because business and earning money encourage the production of more and more cars .
And I cannot imagine that business interests will step behind in favour of environmental reasons .

1159,190605.txt,P5,FRA,medium,"The great majority of cars are using oil to work .
But , as everyone knows , oil is more and more difficult to find and expensive to extract , as it is a limited ressource .
So , as it is said everywhere , it will be neccessary to limit our consumption .
Then , people 's awarness of ecological issues is growing : people are wondering which world they will leave to their children , and try to take measures to curb the trend : that is why , for example , the Tokyo act try to limit pollution .
At a smallest level , some european cities try to prevent city centers from being overspoilt : in some ones cars are banned from the center , in others they are allowed only every twice day ...
The trend is to make public transport prevailing for daily travels .
Such an evolution can bring us to think we will find less cars in twenty years than today .

But things are not so easy .
First , ecological care does not concern every countries on earth : it develops itself mostly in `` developped countries '' which have already have their industrial revolution .
Developping country , in particular China , have other priorities than ecology and economy of ressources : they want to develop themselves , to challenge Western countries .
And to achieve their goals , they must produce , however it spoil or not .
In the same time , the purchase power in China is increasing , like it did in Europe during the industrial revolution , and massive consommation is coming .
And we can expect it will represent a giant market for all car brands .
That 's why we may so think that we will find more car on earth in twenty years .

6100,1034797.txt,P5,DEU,high,"Like wars and foreign policy also a big part of our future depends on oil and fossil-resources .
There are two possibilities in my opinion .
The first one is that there will definitelty be fewer cars in use than today .
Because there might not be enough oil to provide fuel for the millions of cars .
But one has to considers that the consequence is that not only cars are affected .
One could easily say that a car is not that important .
But if there is no fuel left for the cars , there is either non for the bus , for a taxi , for the loanmower and for airplanes .
Nobody will go nowhere .
I personally could take my bike and go to the grocery store , but what for ?
There will be no possibility to do my groceries because the shelves will be empty .
If there is no fuel for cars , then there is no fuel for trucks that take the groceries to the supermarket .
And this is only the peak of the iceberg .
There will be no production , no traffic and even todays hightech might break down .

I do not want to paint this vision of the future too black .
There is another possibility .
Since we know that the whole traffic and one could even say the world is too dependant on fossil resouces such as oil , we could change that .
There so many sophisticated scientists who work on solutions on how to gain energy .
And they have results , like wind and sun als renewable enery resouces .
We could already reduce the need for oil , if we for examlpe buz our vegetables from a farmer in our town .
Then less truck would be needed .
Whatever we do we need to start changing our energy-wasting habits now .
Then in twenty years there might be as many cars as today but they will run with non-fossil energy .
But I do definitely think that there will be less cars that run by fuel in twenty years .

2717,469694.txt,P8,DEU,high,"In my opinion , success is mainly the result of realized chances and opportunities .
As a consequence , I agree with the issued statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .

I do acknowledge that there may be situations in which it may prove better to stick to what you are used to do .
In the course of a sports examination , for example , it may not be too wise to try an entirely new way of jumping across a hurdle .

However , even in a situation like this the basic fact remains valid that without taking some risk you may miss your chances .
In my example this means that this one different jump might just have been the one your teacher wanted to see .

Apart from that , I believe that you ca n't make any progress if you stay persistently at the same level .
And always doing what you know how to well already does n't mean anything else but precisely this remaining static and without progress .
In order to be successful , it is , in my opinion , essential that you make some progress .
For usually success is connected with some achievement .
This is just another reason why I agree with the issued statement .

However , the most important reason , why I affirm this statement , is that chances may appear suddenly .
And as I have explained prior to this , I consider taking and realizing your chances to be of fundamental importance for success .
If you always pondered about whether to seize an opprtunity or not , it would probably be gone before you came to a decision .
It is often impossible to realize your chances with an absolute certainty that everything will turn out all right .
Consequently , there always is a risk in realizing them .
And if you are not willing to take this risk and instead stick to what you know to do well already , you may very likely miss a chance to be successful .

6582,1075905.txt,P3,ZHO,high,"Some people are saying that young people nowadys do not give enough time to helping their communities ; however , I disagree .
By careful observations , I believe that young people nowadys do give enough time to help their communities .

There are several ways to help the communities such as by volunteering , caring for people , participating in community activities .
Many young people today make contributions to their communities by participating in volunteering jobs .
A recent news report in Taiwan has shown that more and more students today are willing to volunteer at places including libraries and hospitals , during their summer vacations .
This may seem common in America , however , it 's a revolutionary trend in Taiwan .
Ten or twenty years ago , students in Taiwan were regulated by their parents to only focus their attention on their studies .
Young people during that time were educated to only care about themselves , about their studies and were not allowed to do `` un-paid '' works such as volunteering jobs .
However , during recent years , young people are more willing to sacrafice their time to do volunteering works which shows that young people today spend more time on helping their coummunities .

In addition , young people today cares more about people , even animals in their communities .
There was a horrible news about a man who abuse cats in his home recently in Taiwan .
The man force his cats to drink detergents and made them make bubbles .
And then , his took pictures of this abusement and post them on the internet .
The young people in Taiwan were irritated by his actions and by cooperations , track down the man 's internet IP address and located where he live .
Consequently , the man was punishment by the police of his actions , due to the help from these young people who cares about animals .

Furthermore , many young people particpate in their community activities .
For example , I have a friend that join the dance club that is held by his coummunity .
He was able to meet lots of people with similar interest for that particular club .
And if members from that club has problems , he would try to help them at no costs .

Finally , young people today do give time in helping their communities .
And this trend can be easily found by careful observations .

Based on my own experience , I can said it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , so I agree with the statement .
I have been working in a big oil company since 2000 and in these time I could do a lot of thing and I learned a lot of things of many subjects .
In fact I am Geophycis and I am going to do a Master in business next year and it is a result that in these six years I did a lot of different thing in a different position in my company .

I think that if I can do a master in business I will have more skills in order to reached a good position into my company because I will do the same work that I am used to do , but in addition I will be prepared to face a different challenges .

I am sure that is better have knowledge of different academic subjects because this give us the skill to do a lot of different works , it is very important in a world where the technology are changing very fast , and where it is difficult to know how the reality can change so it is neccesary to be prepared for these changes moreover to have the skills to survive into a competitive world .

In conclusion I strongly agree with the idea that is better to have broad knowledge of many academics subjects because in this way we can have a open vision about any problems and we have more skills in order to survive in a competitive world .

7866,1208675.txt,P7,KOR,high,"I completely agree with this statment .
In my opinion , education and learning has a great more impact on the student if the subject touches them emotionaly and personally .
Learning facts and reciting things memorized form textbooks can achieve nothing for the student except from giving them a shallow concept of education .

As an example , I will present a personal experience of mine that has actually happened to me .
In one lesson of personal study , we , as a class , touched upon the subject of animal rights .
I never had any thoughts on this subject before and reading a essay written on the subject in a text book , i still had no idea and opinion on the subject .
Reading from the textbook established by the school gave me no understanding of the subject .
But later on in the week the teacher took us on a trip to a animal shelter called the BSPCA .
There , i saw animals that were actually under a lot of stress and animals that have been abused in the past .
From that experience i learned a real lesson and actually understood the idea and concept behind the subject and from that i realized that what really is important in a lesson , is the amount you understand rather than learning facts and getting an A * on a test .

This is parly why i think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
Actually understanding a subject can help build character , history , personality and values in a character .
On the other hand , learning facts from a textbook can only make a copy of an unoriginal being that believes in some one elses views ( the person who wrote the facts , or a fact that has no personal appeal ) .

The major reason that makes me believe that this statement is true is that the people around me and myself have many stories to tell , and the reason that people have stories to tell is because they have learnt , understood and experienced ideas and concepts that merily , definetly , did n't come from a textbook full of facts .

In conclusion , I absolutely agree with with the following statement :

`` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts ''

because of the several reasons listed above .

3845,666752.txt,P1,DEU,high,"Over centuries , starting almost with the founding of the first universities , the ideal of a completely educated person was dominant on the European continent - somebody who masters ancient languages as good as he is at natural sciences or even the arts .
And on the other end of the line ?
There was the specialist , soley focused on his subject , almost an idiot in his single-mindedness .
But the times have changed .
With todays fast growing amount of scientific knowlege and the fast pace of research - new findings published almost every day - no one can know everything these days anymore .
So the specialist , who was laughed at only 150 years ago , seems now to be the ideal of an educated person .

However I think one should try to take the best parts of both educational ideals for oneself .
And my suggestion to make this possible , is not to try to gain broad and specific knowledge at the same time , but one after the other .

During primary and secondary school there is plenty of time to teach the students different subjects and viewpoints .
Even if it seems to be a waste of time because there wo n't be an opportunity to use the attained things later on , it will still widen the students mind and help him organizing things s/he learns later on .
For example , when I went to secondary school , I was taught Latin and Ancient Greek - which both do n't serve much purpose in todays world , but it helped me not only to study French and Spanish easily but also told me a lot about European history and mythology , what is quite important for job I do now .

On the other side , when somebody enters university or has already studied some years , it 's time to take a decision and choose a subject or a focus for his graduate time .
Because of the above mentioned imense amount of available knowledge , this focusing on one field is propably the only way to be really good at it .
( Which again is in my opinion the main party in doing something ) .

So my ideal is somebody who has a broad basis of knowledge , which makes him able to decide , based on the broad basis , in which subject he wants to specialise in later .

11357,1866189.txt,P7,ARA,medium,"Is it more importent for students to understand ideas and concepts than its for them to learn facts ?
This question offenly asked by parents that have dificultis with the academic level of thier children .
In my opinion its better for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

An idea or a concept may sometimes be the result that becomes a fact .
So if we understanded the idea we could conclude the fact but if we memroize a fact we can not conclude its idea since we dont no have the main base which is the idea .
If we take for example Ineshtine , when he discovered the nuclears a wide path of both good and bad inventions were discovered .

the teacher in the school explains for students ideas and concepts then let them memorize facts becouse sometimes a whole lesson can talk about one idea that results many facts .
If you want to understand and memorize the lesson 's facts you must know the main idea that the lesson is talkin about .
Solving a math problem is the best example for this idea .
Supose u need to prove the fact that this equation is defined or not , you will began solving using the conepts and evntually end up with fact that it defined or not .

Although a fact seams to most of us easier to memorize than understanding a concept or an idea .
But if we only memrized a fact it will have no meaning or no logical explanation for it in our mind , so as a result , we forget it quickly .
But if we knew the idea or the concept tne memorization will take no time and the fact will live in our memory for ever .

finally , knowing and idea and a concept is much better than memorizing a fact and if the fact was described as a location , i guess that the idea will be the bridge that will lead you to that location .

5200,904717.txt,P7,SPA,high,"Learning is based on too main tecniques , understanding the ideas and concepts and learning facts .
Understanding the ideas and concepts is a very important step in the learning process , it helps students absorbe the essence of the topic .
For example : Jenny has to study science , the first thing she should do is read all the information , digest it and make her oun conclusions based on her knowledge .
Tis step is more general , it includes more aspects than the next one .

After getting the main points of a lesson , students learn the facts .
this provides them with a solid base when the use of the previos knowledge is requied .
In contrast with understandind the ideas , learning facts is a specific activity , where you memorize selected aspects of your interest .

In my opinion understanding the ideas and concepts is as important as learning the facts .
I have been in contact with both of the ways of studiyng and I have got better grades when I learn the facts than when I focuse on understanding the lesson .
Even though when I learn the facts I usually dont get the esence of the lesson , I get better grades .
It is a little absurd but almost all of my classmates had the same problem .
That is why I state in my personal opinion that the understanding is as important as memorizing .
It is a way of itegrating two proceses that complete each other and forming a whole , joining both steps .
As a result the flaws of one would be covered by the good thing of the other and viceversa .

For me , the perfect learning process would be the one which includes both of the steps mentioned above , linking them by relating the overview of a lesson with the specific facts that support it .

2090,359895.txt,P7,ZHO,medium,"People are learning to grow with the basic skills and experience , so it is much more significant for young people to understand ideas and concepts than to learn the facts instead , and the reasons are as the folowings .

First of all , knowing the concepts and ideas can help young people understand the rules of this world and see the common points exist between disinct peope and things , which gives them the basic point of view about the society they live in .
Besides , most of the facts happen according to the concept and their ideas .
For instance , the young people are supposed to show respect to the elders in the society as the principles and a nice manner , like the government provide the elders more protection and help in finance and health care each year .
In this case , everyone regards it as a right and valuable thing to do , so this rule goes on and on .
The young people know this rule will easily understand the way this society runs and come up with a right and fare opinion about this .
As a result , knowing the concepts is knowing the world properly and quickly .

The second is that the so called `` facts '' are enumorous in this world and young people cannot learn them all even in his whole life .
There are always some spacial cases in each field of facts that will cinfuse the young people who do not know the concepts and ideas of most of the things that happen around him .
In that way , people is definitly having trouble in understand things and dealing with things they met .
What is worse , the lack of knowledge of concepts will make the young people lose themselves .
The facts are the surface of concepts and ideas while the unpridictable facts are waiting for people to find by themselves .

Finnally , not knowing the concepts of facts willl give the young people wrong direction for they only learn their life based on things they see , and do not know how to look at them in a proper and objective way .
This will lead to an bad result and a young student , for instance , will not understand will the criminals are punished while they do not know how people are supposed to behave in this world .

Therefore , to understand the concepts and ideas are much more important than merely knowing the facts so called .

176,29755.txt,P7,ITA,high,"This statement has been greatly discussed in many didactic environments for the simple reason that some consider the theoretical knowledge to be more important than the practical one and some consider the opposite .

I was lucky to have personally attended schools that agreed and disagreed with the statement since I attended an italian high school ( that relies mostly on ideas and concepts ) and a canadian high school ( that focuses more on real facts that occured ) .

This is why foreigners find that italians know how to talk about a certain topic but they do not know how to actually solve ( or i should say ) `` fix '' it .
My uncle , an engineer who lives in Canada , once attended a conference here in Italy and he noticed how Italians honestly might know more about the theory ( in this case physics or maths ) but need help from the more `` hands-on '' engineers from abroad who considered real cases during their education giving them a higher experience .

In my opinion learning about facts is definately more enjoyable and gains a higher interests within the students .
It also gives you a better insight of today 's world situation .
The reason why we study History is because we ought to learn about events that occured in the past and to prevent the same mistakes or find a better solution .

Once I came back from my school year abroad it was n't easy for me to get used to the old and stricter method .
I tried to make my teacher understand and realize how a fact that occured implicitely has the concept in it .

Experience also plays a key role and to discuss about real facts certainly helps a lot .
As once Oscar Wilde said `` Experience is the name we give to our mistakes '' .

This is why I believe that it is definately important to learn and understand ideas and concepts but the next fundamental step would be to consider a real fact that concerns it .

Italy has a very ancient background on its shoulders and it would be very hard to change its attitude or point of view .

2928,507349.txt,P7,ARA,high,"As the years pass by , many universities , schools and other institutions are trying to teach the future generations and provide them with the wide variety of sciences which make them ready for the future challenges .

The question that always rises in these institutions is whether it is more important for the students to understand the ideas and concepts or to learn the hard facts .

In my personal opinion , i think it is more important for the students to understand the main concepts of the subjects than to learn facts .

As for a student to learn a fact , all he has to do is to memorise it .
Memorising something without understanding it will lead to forgetting this fact as soon as _or shortly after _ the stimulus for memorising it is over .

Facts are only memorised and stored in the long term memory if they are constantly used in everyday life .
For example when a medical student has to memorise all different types of drugs .
If this student was n't asked about these drugs in every morning rounds , where he had to revise them everytime he made a mistake , he would otherwise forget them .

On the other hand , understanding the subject makes it easier to remember .
For example when the same medical student has to memorise some information about the physiology of the human body .
he can understand it once , and answer any questions related to this topic years after he had studied it .

This is why i prefer understanding the topic over learning the facts .
As the facts are easily lost over the years and what remains is what we understand of that particular subject .

Understanding the ideas and concepts requires far more work and processing by the student than only memorising the facts .
So it is always up to the student at the end to choose between understanding and memorising .

we just have this mind to think , work and some others .

this power is very breakful .
but if we once get many to shot , that must be missed .
the reason about my mind for this following statement like this shot .

if we get to have broad knowledge of mand academic , it just like shot many at once .
the end almost is missed everything .
but if we concen us all power to make one thing .
i think it must will be get .

as the chinese proverb said that `` do n't for apple to throw the melon '' .if we do n't make our nervous to one point .
then we will watch around everything .
and we will see a flash apple and forget you alread have a melon in your hands .
ok , if you have throwed your melon and get the apple .
plaese make this apple doing its mostly power .
if that you prehaps will invite a new kind of apple .
but if you still look around , i think you must will thorwn this apple to get anther frasher one .
maybe it is an orange .

so in fact , as a normal person , you could n't make your attention to many things and do these things very well .
this like some scitists , we hard to hear a scitists get many kinds of the nobel prize .
most of them cost their whole life just get one kind prize .

in this world , we need someone do one thing toply .
and we also need many this thing .

Therefore , sometimes people could be angry with their product when it is diffrent from what they saw in the advertisement and what they expected though advertisement products could look much better than they really are .

7335,1144396.txt,P7,ARA,medium,"It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

I agree that it 's more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
Because the students , they need ideas and concepts to understand the lesson or what they are watching .

If u give a child a picture or a photo with no explaination , he/she wont know what is happening in the picture .
The child needs atleast something to talk about the pictures or what is happening .
For example , just a picture of a guy standing doing nothing .
The child will not know anything , but if there is a picture of a guy doing something he/she will know what is happening .
The guy might be eating for playing or anything like that .

But if only giving facts to the child , he will not think , he will just do what is he told to do and never think .

The best solution is , and what i think and tried , is that giving ideas and concepts and teaching them the facts are much better .
They can think and give examples of what is happening .
Sometimes its just easier to memorize something but it wont help if this thing happened in real life .
For example , just memorizing the rule of the chess game and never played it , you wont know how to play unless if u try it many times .

Its good that the person knows how to use the facts and knows how to give samples what is happening .
For example giving facts of what 's happening now between Israel and Palestine that Israel conquered Palestine and will never leave it free .

This is what i think about the important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

9216,1470758.txt,P6,ARA,medium,"I disagree because traviling with a group led by a tour guide is a

bad idea for my thinking .

First when someone is travilng with a group led by a tour guide , it

makes him or her being controlled , so he or she ca n't have the ability to move freelly .
For example , if someone needs to go to the

restroom , every one should wite for that person until he or she

finishes .
And also if someone does n't like the place or has been to

the place that group are going to , he or she should go with the group .

The second reason is that travilng with a group could be

unhealthy in someone 's health .
When someone travels with a group ,

he or she may have healthy problems that could transfear to

someone in the group .
For example , if someone has Inflo , it can

transfear ( go ) to someone in the group easlly .

The third reason that when someone is traviling with a group the

travel based on a plan .
When a group travels , it has a ready plan .
So , when

someone wants to change his mind about a place , he ca n't change

the plan he should go with the plan or leave the group after paying

some money .
For example , if someone changes his mind about

visitng a musume with the group , he ca n't change the plan from

visiting the musume to visit the zoo .
So he should go with the group

by rhe plan or leave the group after paying some money .

All in all , as you see , traviling with a group is a bad idea because

of the ability of moving , the health and changing the mind .
I think

when someone wants to travel , he or she should go by themselvs .

10159,1651191.txt,P8,TUR,medium,"Everybody wants to be successfull in life , nevertheless only some people achive this .
I 'm firmly agree with the statement that successfull people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
In the present essay I will endouver to figure out my reasons .

From my point of view , one of the major factor in reaching success is self-development .
But how can it be possible while always doing the same things .
You should try new things to reach better solutions .
Otherwise you can not develop what you are doing .

Moreover in our high compettative era it is more difficult to be successful .
Because everybody endeavor to do their best , you must do something different .
Being different always make you more easy to being recognised , nevertheless you must try something different , even something never tried before .
And this means risk .

When we consider the successful people lived in the history , we see a common point .
This is risk taking .
Although there are many people in history who has taken risk and than fail , I think we must be thankful for their effort because we have reached our modern era with the efforts of such kind of people .
For instance Madam Currie risked her life to find some radiactive materials .
But she made a huge progress in chemistry area .

In conclusion , I want to remark that doing what we already know how to do well , without taking risk in lfe , we can not make progress .
From my point of view success is worthwhile to take some risks in life .

11533,1894288.txt,P7,HIN,high,"I feel that its always better to understand things and not just mug them up .
Understanding ideas and concepts can lead to a better understanding of the topic .
Also if you get to understand it completely it can help you better in understanding of its related topics .
You would also be benefited at the time of the examination .
Understanding helps you a lot for future .
If you go for research work later in your life then this understanding of topic would help you to take your research easily .

Secondly when you understand a idea then you dont commit mistakes on that particular topic .
For example , if a doctor dont care to understand concepts about the human body , then in future he would be prone towards doing errors .
Also he wont become a successfull doctor in future .
And by destroying a case he would end himself in prison .
So , the example clearly shows how important it is to understand things .
We can also take an example of a computer engineer , where every fact and concept about the machine counts a lot .
And if he is unable to understand ideas then he would just end up in choas .
He would just damage the machine , and we all know how costly these computer machine are .

Thirdly understanding of ideas in a younger age help you a lot when you go and pursue your higher education .
For example , the understanding of concepts at bachelor level help you a lot in understanding of the concepts in your masters .

However , when it comes to the examinations , when you dont have time to understand concepts its always advisable to learn the facts .
At time crises it always better to learn than wasting time in understanding it , because you are never sure that after spending so much time in understanding it , will you really be able to understand it .
Also at the time of quizzes only learned facts help you win the game , and not the understanding of it .
Because there are so many things in the world to know about , and you dont have time to understand there concepts , and only option is to learn it .
As reinstated in my answer understanding is important , it cannot be compared with learning .
Both have there own standing .

11436,1880429.txt,P7,JPN,high,"I would like to understand ideas and concepts rather than learning facts .
There are several reasons why I prefer this way .

First , a fact can be more easily to use if you know the concept of it .
If you do n't have any idea about some facts , you ca n't go further step in order to improve your ability .
For example , let 's say you know many formulas about math , but does n't know how to use it .
Of course it is really important to know formulas .
But , when you have a math test , you will be confuse because you have no idea what the formulas mean .
You 'll have variety of facts , but you ca n't use it properly .
By contrast , if you understand the concept of the formulas , you know how and when to use it .

Secondly , if you know the concepts of something , it is easily to understand the facts .
This is because you feel comfortable when you have some images that are related to the facts .
I can say this by using example from math formulas again .
If you have images of basic formulas , you should n't have hard time to memorize many formulas at the same time .
Sometimes I get confuse when I encounter to new rules we use in the math class .
This is because I do n't have a basic understanding about formulas , which means I have no ideas about it .
When I know how to prove why the formula can be used , I have deep idea about it , so it is not painful to memorize it .
Also , if I know some backgrounds of these formulas , I do well on the math exam .

Finally , you can improve in some ways by understanding the concepts .
When I play golf , the ball curve from right to left .
If I want to fix this curving , I ca n't just shots millions of balls until I could finally make it straight .
At first , I have to know why and how a golf ball makes a curve .
This part is the concept .
Once I got some basic ideas , now I can hit and try some different swings in order to make the ball straight .

6584,1076020.txt,P8,HIN,high,"Yes , I agree with the statement that `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .

The Homo sapiens can be broadly classifed into two categories .

The first category consist of those people who are happy to live a risk-free normal life .
They like to get up in the morning , do the house chores and leave for the office , sit in a cubicle and spend 8 hours 5 days a week .
They want to enjoy the weekend with the family and LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER .
The main charaterstic of this category is that they want to live their life exactly in the same manner as their neighbour is living .
The only example that comes to my mind for this category is the COMMON MAN .
This is what differentiates them from the other category of Homo sapiens .
They make a contribution to the society as a WHOLE but their individual contribution is minimal .
They will not be remembered because of the fact that they do what they are told to do .

The second category of Homo sapiens are those who actually make the world a better place to live in .
People in this category have the names like Albert Einstein , Thomas Edison , Mahatma Gandhi , Yuri Gagarin , and many others .
What makes them special is the fact that they all were curious and excited to explore new areas in their field .
Albert Einstein and Thomas Edison made a breakthrough in science , gave us gravtiy and elctricity respectively .
Mahatma Gandhi created ripples in the political world through his approach of non-violence movements .
Because Yuri Gagrin dared to enter into space , that we were able to think beyond the planet Earth .
These people had some characterstics similar at root levels .
They were ready to work in a monotonous environment .
They were ready to risk anything to prove their point .

11756,1935473.txt,P4,SPA,high,"The most promesing way to sell a product is by advertising it to people .
To sell their products , companies often claim false information about them .
I totally aggre that most of the products advertised seem much better than what they really are .

The objective of advertising products is to attract people into buying them .
Some companies often attract people by selling false information about their products .
For example when I am watching television , I see many advertisments of reducing fat pills .
The add claims that these pills will reduce your body weight in just two weeks .
Obviously this is not true , and I have hear of many people who have bought these pills , that it could seriously affect the heart .
Thereby , the producers of this pills attract many customers and only care about making money regardless of what may happen to people .

Marketing companies rely on certain techniques that attract people in order to sell products .
Among the techniques used , surveys are conducted to explore people 's needs .
Thereafter , the advertisments contain information that hooks customers .
The problem is that many customers are ignorant and have not learn to differ the real product with the product that they see on adds .
As a result , companies can take advantage of this and make their products seem better and suitable for people .
For example , salesmen find rural towns a perfect place to sell products .
Why is this ?
The people living in those town are ignorant and can be easely tricked into buying the products .

In conclusion , I aggre that many advertisments make their produts look better than they really are .
The reason to do so , is to attract people and make more money than what they would make if they told the truth about their products .
Unfortunately , marketing companies can easely sell their products to ignorant people who believe them .

4074,707747.txt,P5,TUR,medium,"In recent years , some people argue that there will be fewer cars in use in near future since the innovations in transportation technology .
However , the argument seems me far from reality .
Although , there are some studies in this direction , I do n't think that cars which have an important place in our lifes can be replaced by easily in twenty years .
The statistics and the projects of governments justifies my beliefs .

First of all , our past experience challenges to the argument .
If we look at the statistics to understand how the tendency of the numbers of the car in use is , we see clearly that there is a permanent increase in car usage .
In other words , the statistics of past data does not support the prediction in argument .
It can easily be seen that all the statistics beginning from the invention of the cars to today demostrates that the usage of cars has dramatically increased .
When people have better economic conditions , they desire to buy cars .
Inceases in population in all over the world also served this tendency .

Secondly , nowadays many developing countries continue to built new roads .
For instance , in my country - Turkey - there are regions where roads are not even suitable for cars and the government is too eager to expand the total kilometers of high ways to make car usage easier .
In this purpose they expense a significant part of the budget to the transportation project .
This efforts to increase high ways and to make them secure made also the people more eager to use cars .

If we talk about a far future when there is no need to use cars because of the adaptation of helichopters or a fututre where world has connected with metros then we can expect the cars to disappear .
But , today they are crucial for our comfort and I ca n't see a vehicle that can replace car usage .

The reason why I said that is obvious .
Because nowday we see yong people are interested or we can say beasy with other selly things rather than helping their community with things can be usefull to them or to others in the future .
They spent most of their time in front of the TV watching some movie or watching a video clip for some stupid singer , if not then you can see them lestinning to the music all day long or playing video games with their friends like they never want to grow up .
By any chance if they get fed up with all these stuffs , they continue their day by playing some kind of a game football or basketball or volly ball or any other game they figure .
After they finish with all these game and eventually they want to behave like adults or grown up people , they go and date thier girlfriends and take them to fancy restaurants .

During the weekend they go swimmming or climbing or shopping or to do some other things .
what I dont understand why dont try to make some time to help their communities .

As I always say build your community if you want to build your self .
I think we should encorage young people to serve the community by putting some plans to create the love of their community inside them .

5988,1025558.txt,P7,ZHO,high,"While a large number of students realize that understanding the ideas and concepts are the basis of a learning process , I tend to believe that learning facts is more important .

First , the facts let the students know the implementation and design based on the abstract ieads and concepts on the textbook .
A student who conducts and manages a software development team may have deeper understanding over the area of software design and human resource management than the one who only learn from the books .
For example , a designer may have more detailed and deepened comprehension of the internal core thinking , which is the most valuable part in his job , after he finishes a design by researching and review a lot of books and articles including concepts proposed before .

In addition , it makes more sense for a student to learn the facts brought by his or her own hand-on experiment .
When I was a member in the web development team of our university website , I learned a lot from the practice of installing and configuring the web server and writing code for a web application , which is not fully stated on any book in the book store .
This makes my way more broad and easier to go to achieve expertise on the field of conputer science .

Lastly , learning facts is a higher level that just understanding the original ideas and concepts .
The students who knows how to put the principles into the daily work may show a stronger ability to master not only what to learn but also how to learn , that is to say , they are more likely to become a quick learner , an ability which is called for by many international business companies such as Microsoft , Google and IBM .

From all the discussion I mentioned above , we could safely draw a conclusion that learning facts takes a more significant position that just understanding the ideas and concepts in the learning process .

If a person does not understand the why of the facts I think that is not usefull learn about it .
In my experiance , I always try to understand the reason that there is beside an event .
Becouse I think that if I understand the basic concept it will be more simple learn fact and not forget it .

I study criminology and for my work is basic understand why is happen a certain event , what is the principle cause that causes a certain type of event .
For example , for me is not important learn the fact becouse I must understand the reason that ther is beside a certain type of behaviour and not only the result of it .

But I think that is not usefull only for my type of study but for all type of faculty .
For example , in the scientific faculty is also very important it .
It will be very important understand the reason why happening a certain natural event for example and not learn the events alone .

In conclusion , I think that if a person want understand very well facts and not learn it becouse of the school or becouse a person says that He must learn it , he must question himself the basic ideas and the concepts that is linked on that events .

10345,1685185.txt,P7,ITA,high,"This issue has been discussed widely within the already established literature , and , obviously , it is a very interdisciplinary topic .
We could discuss about the relationships between reality and ideas referring to very different conceptual fields , and , hence , using very different theoretical systems .
According to my sociological preparation , I would discuss the topic considering the social implications of understand facts and ideas , within the overarching context of education .

As a first point , we should define what is an idea and what is a fact .
Defining them could be important in order to continue with the discussion .
If we conseder an idea as a totally autonomous concept within the individual process of defining reality , I will state that ideas are useless , not being based on experience .
Coherently with the Kant 's thinking , the process of construction of the world can be defined as the filling process of some categories `` boxes '' .
These boxes are defined as the basic visions of the reality [ i.e. the causal relationships between phenomena ] , and in order to be productive for the undertsanding of the world they have to be filled by specific external experiences .
Therefore , it is my opinion that ideas cannot be considered as separate and independent concepts form the reality , but rather that they are influenced , and they influence at the same time , our perception of the world , and , consequently , the way we act within it and the way we create our identities .
In order to come back to the statement you provide me , I absolutely do n't think that it could be possible to think about ideas and expertise in a separate way , and so the core and hidden question behind that sentence is : how do ideas and experiences are related within the preparation of the students .
In practise , in order to have a well-working and a long - end didactic we should provide a real experience for each concept or ideas we want to teach .
The experience I 'm talking about is not supposed to be strictly based on a practical action [ as going outdoor and see the trees after a lesson on plants ] , but it could be simply providing some practical examples about the matter of study .

On the other side , experience is always influenced by ideas embedded in our society and , of course , in our indentity [ considered as an idea of undertsand ourself and the others in relaton to us ] .
Teaching clear and coherent ideas is a starting point in order to have a complete experience of the empirical world .
In conclusion , ideas and experience are totally interlinked each other and mutually influenced , in a dialectic way .

If they have enough money , they may like to enjoy a big meal or shopping .

I believe a person should be able to take risks and try new things in order to be successful .
If one 's limits itself to want it already know how to do well it has no chances to evolve .
For me having this attitud is like taking the highway to been bored .
Life has to be a game or at least a challenge .
How often do you realize that you just did something you could not imagine you were able to do ?
This behaviour is for me the simple key of success , it is what makes the difference betweem two evenly skilled people .

In order to enhance one 's chance to have this positive attitud , I would even recommand to add an acting course to highschools ' core curriculums .
It would help students to overpass their limits and explore their complex natures .

Another characteristic that is necessary to access this behaviour is self confidence .
You need to trust yourself and believe in your capability to adapt yourself and learn quickly .

But of course this behaviour is successful only to working people .
You will never be able to make it if you do not work and just keep faking it .
Furthermore it could eventually destroy all you have done by discrediting you .
If you not not plan to work , you should better stick to what you know how to do well .

It is completly insane to set a frontier between past and present .

Success in whatever field is built on past experiences .
For instance , in biology , current scientists are leading research programs using the conclusions of former scientists .
Alexander Fleming discovered pennicilline in the 1920s and medical progress could not be as advanced as it is today if he had not .

Nevertheless , admittedly , if you do not take risks , you are not likely to make progress .
Indeed , if investors had not trusted scientists to fund their researches , there would not have been such an advanced science .
Investors can be States , private companies , etc .
They take risks because when they invest their money in medical reserach for intance , they are not sure that this research program will be successful tomorrow .
If the program fails , they can lose all the money they invest in such a program to the detriment to other potential successful programs .

The solution would be to match both the opinions .
Most of successful people try new things and use what they know from former experiences at the same time .
Indeed , people must call themselves into question before taking risks and they must try new things to survive .
Tht is why human being are so different from animals .
This is what we call human intelligence .
Not to take danger

Basically , I think both parts of the statement are true but we must bind rhem together not oppose them .
Indeed , in order to go further in the analysis , it is impossible to take risks whithout using what we know and , on the contrary , you cannot make progress without taking risks .

64,11566.txt,P1,TEL,medium,"The issue at hand is that is it better to have broad knowledge of many academics subjects than to specialise on one subject .
This is important becauseit makes us know what students are actually interested in .
Ipefer it is better to specialise in one subject rather than having broad knowledge of many academics .

First reason to support my statement is that when we concentrate on many academic subjects we could not concentrate well on all of the subjects .
And we can not do well in all the subjects .
when you take one specific subject and specialise on it you could concentrate well on the subject and can do justification to the subject .
for this reason I think my choice is superior .

Secondly , by specialising on a specific subject makes you learn many new things without any difficulty .
and you can focus more on a single point in a better way .
By researching on the subject you can discover many new things in that subject .
for example many great prople such as einstein devoted his entire life to a specific subject in which he is interested and many discoveries in that field such as mass energy equivalance theorem e.t.c therefore from this reason I support my choice is best .

Finally , all the people would not be interested or capable of learning all the academic subjects .
for example if somene is forced by something to learn a subject in which he donot have interest he can not learn it in a proper way .
so it is better to specialise in one subject in which he has interest instead of learning all the subjects .

So according to the above reasons mentioned it is better for a student to specialise in one subject in which he is interested rather than learning all academic subjects .

Second , with the development of internet , home office became available , which means people might not need to travel far away to get to the office and start to work .
So , as more and more people choose to work at home , there would be less requirment a car to take them to a far distance to work .

Thirdly , as more and more governments are trying to improve the transpotation , in order to convenient those people who could not afford cars , bus would become more and more important to people 's daily lives .
consequently , people will rely on bus touring instead of car as long as the transpotation greatly improved and bus transpotation became really conveneint .

To sum up , because of more and more serious air pollution and people 's awaraness of protecting of our enviornment , home office became availale , and improvement of transpotation condition , i believe that there wi

7730,1185524.txt,P8,DEU,high,"Some people say `` no risk , no fun '' and because of this no profits and furthermore no success .
I definitely agree with these people and with the given statement .
Of course there are witnessed examples of successful people who just copied ideas in order to earn big profits .
Of course many people who do not run a business in which risk and creativity are daily questions , are able to realize a nice career as well as high wages .
And of course people who define success in a completely different way such as being a member of a kind of club maybe even the captain of a bowling team are successful with a high degree of riskaversion .

But from my point of view people are only successful if they are able to change their environment significantly .
I do not reffer to the direct environment as the personal social context of an individual .
I am talking about changing the whole society or at least the business sector you are concerned with .
What would our world look like without great reformers and visons of few people ?
Personalities like M. L. King , Adam Smith or Mahatma Gandhi changed their society with their inventions , theories or opinions .
But without taking risks or thinking in new dimensions , developments that occured as a result of their thinking would not have been possible until now .

To be successful it demands a low level of riskaversion , a genious strategy ( that can be a simple strategy as well ) and the ability to implement it .
And facts you already know might be the basic knowledge to explore several ideas but without risk and the willingness to do something completely new success cannot be realized .

Finally I totally agree with the given statement .
I would like to strengthen my opinion again by repeating that from my point of view risk and success are strong partners that cannot be changed .

6113,1036331.txt,P4,SPA,high,"I strongly agree with this statement .
Let me explain why .
We live in the era of information and technology .
Our everyday life is sorrounded by this fact : computers and Internet , television , cinema . ..
Enterprises take benefit from this new way of obtaining information , and settle their advertisements everywhere .
We can see publicity on the streets ( for example bus stops ) , on the Internet ( while we surf the net , many different advertisements will show up ) , in the cinema ( films usually contain hidden references to products ) ...
But the main way enterprises expose their products is television .

Most of the population has a TV at home , or at least , has access to it in the neighbourhood or at school . ..
Who does n't watch television ?
A person that might admit not watching it would be treated as an alien or something similar .
Publicity in television is the main support of a TV channel : enterprises pay large amounts of money to have a space after a program , so they can show their products .

And what about the products showed on the television ?
Well , as we can daily see , all types of items are anounced : cars , perfums , films , drinks , food . ..
But are these products exposed from an objective point of view ?
No , I do n't think so .
Publicity experts design the advertisements in a way it will call the spectator 's attention , but not because of the products nature , instead of that , they will talk about its effects , about the feelings or impressions you will experience if you buy it or use it .
Have you ever seen a `` high quality '' perfum advertisement ?
This publicity will not refer to the way the essence is made , no , this advertisement will talk about the effect it might have in the person and all the people that sorrounds that person .
For instance : the perfum will make you feel fresh ; or make all the men fall in love with you ; or make you the sexiest girl in the city ; or even compare the perfum 's effect with the great pleasures in life !
The thing is that we do n't realise this is n't true until we buy the product , and then , it 's already too late .
So finally we conclude , as the statement says , that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

During my studies I have often asked to myse lf it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
From my experience I realized that the best way to attain good results is to specialize in one specific subject .
In particoular thare was an event that convinced me of that .

In fact there was a semster in wich I had four courses at the same time plus the development of my bachelor ' s degree thesis .
I was going to begin my Master 's studies and in the same period I even had to present my bachelor 's degree thesis work in a conference .
I was very busy with my thesis however I decided to register for four classes .
It was a big mistake .
In fact I could not attend all the lessons and when I had the exames I did not took good grades .
Moreover I did not have a broad knowledge but just a superficial one .
This was an important experience for my future choiches .

In fact I realized that a broad knowledge is something that comes with time .
In the next semesters I chose to register for two or maximum three classes .
I could attend all the lessons and when I studied at home I had enough time to go depper in the topic that I have had listened in class .
In this way I took very good grades that now permit me to apply as Ph.D. at the M.I.T ..


From my experience during my Master 's studies I realized that it is quite difficult to have a broad and deep knowledge at the same time .
Therefore I think that it is better to specialize in one or few subjects .
In this way it is possible to have a deeper knowledge and after few time even a broad knowledge .
With this porpouse in my mind I am going to apply for my Ph.D. and I am sure that in this way I will able to have other success .

Moreover I think that people want to buy them thereforet it would n't be a normal fact that the number of cars decreased in the future .
Nevertheless could you imagine that it happens ?
It would be a terrible new for me because I lovew cars !

First of all I think that cars are very important for us and that everyone would have to have a car because it allows you to drive wherever you want whenever you want .
In addition , I think that the number of cars will increase insted of decreasing because some countries had already allowd 16 year-old boys to drive .
That means that more cars are going to be bought .

Another reason why I think that there wo n't be more cars in the future is because the market and companies are improving their models .
That 's why people are more interested in cars .
Additionaly the market produces what the people want to buy .

Finally I must say that I have already pass my car exam and I also have bought a new car .
I love my car and I think that it allows me to do a lot of things that a could n't do such as going out at nights with my friends without paying a taxi or going to the beach with my girldfriend .

In conclusion I do n't agree with the sentence because when I wanted to buy my car a recieved a lot of information about the topic and I really think that it is imposible that the number of cars decrease in the future because everything is improving the car-market .

1692,289027.txt,P2,JPN,medium,"I think against the statemente that young people enjoy life more than older people .
To tell you the truth , my oppinion is just the oppsosite for the reasons which follows .

First , because older people have more money than young people in general , they can some activities that yougng people cannot do .
They earn money as official of the government , emplyee of companies or some else while young people go to school and pay tuition .
They can do somethig funny by using this money .
Let me show an example .
Older people can dine at famous restraunt or go lugujury trip that is what young people admire but cannot attain for economic problem .

Second , older people feel more on the same thing than young people , because they have more experiences .
Let me talk about my personal experiences , several years ago I made a trip to Rome with my aunt and see some sightseeing spot .
When we go to some place , my aunt suddenly burst to tears and talk me about romance she made with her ex-lover in Rome .
She surely enjoyed the tirp more than me thanks to this romance .

Certaily , there are somethings that are said to be enjoyed by young people .
For example , love .
Of course , love we made in our youth is sweet and precious momory for all of us .
But who decide older people cannnot make love ?
Older people can make sweet love in the same way as young people do , and get wonderful memories .
Besides that woule be more enjoyable for their experience as I showed in the third paragraph .

For the reasons above , I think older people can enjoy life more than young people .
They can do something young people cannot do thanks to better economic situation , feel more owing to their affluent experiences and do the thing that is usualy said as if the privilage for youth sach as love .

Trying and finding new things by taking risks are often more satisfactory and more useful than doing what people already know how to do well .

To begin with , more new things is created more they are helpful and useful .
For example , to date people used many ways of transportation such as riding a horse , driving a bycycle , or driving a car respectively .
But these are all about land transportations .
Someone considered a totally different one .
As we all know , that is plane and this new technology has changed our lives considerably .

Therefore , new-branded thoughts and discoveries unavoidably , contributes to our lives to live more better and convenient .
Secondly , as long as people try and achieve new things , they use their brains much more and achieve some qualities such as wisdom and creativity .
So Interactions between people would be more efficient in that their point of views enhance .
Also , taking risks plays an important role in a person 's life in terms of self confident and bravery .
For instance these characteristics are very significant for businessmen to keep their businesses more efficient .

Social life oblidge us to talk fluently in any academic subject that triggers our knowledge to oversee reality and facts .
On the other hand it advocates our personality with ideas and opinions toward a certain issue .

However , being specific tells us that we are limited in our rational thinking and concentrating .
Academic means we should face people from differrent countries and cultures under a group working .
This group working is the reason why people are triggered to understand different traditions and behaivors .
For example , beliefs are good to discuss about .

Being inhanced in the academic subjects gives a great personality to the individual that which attract people to take a role in this subject .
Also , it help us to understand things that is related in real life in participating with other people and improving our virsues inorder to deal with others as we are dealt .
Alike specific subjects , the academic ones requires a high level of informations to solve academis problems and this comes from the experience of a person 's deplomate manners and the desent outer looking .

considering the young people nowadays , thay have to contribute their part to help out his/her community .
I personally agree with the statement that , Young people nowaday do not give enough time to help their communities for the following reasons .

Young people is a combination of college going students as well as recently graduated ones from the universities who spend most of the time searching a better job .
The stress on the students is so high these days that they hardly get time to entertain themselves .
That is , they are always tangled with their studies and assignments they need to complete .
In such case , they dont have time for other activities like improving their community .

Other reason is , whenever they get some time young people prefer to spend time with their family and friends rather than improving a community .
This is the cause of the excess burden they are facing from their daily schedule pattern .
For instance , I myself being a graduate student , whenever I get some time from my assignments , I would prefer relaxing at home than going out and improve my community .

Young people also feel that , if the community heads and the corresponding heads feel responsible and do their part correctly then there wont be a question to call young people to participate in such programmes .
young people have to concentrate well on their studies and go on up to their satisfaction levels because these are the people who are the citizens of tomorrow .
young people have to mould themselves in such a way that they could become the role models for their younger generation .

In the concluding note , young people dont give enough time for the improvisations of their community because of the above stated reasons .

If any accident occur on the road no one will bother about that because they are fear if they help and take to hospital it will come to his hands .
If u do like this if come to you it will be the same .
So we should be helpful to the community when ever we need .

As the world growing faster the helping nature is going down .
people are eager to earn money they do not want to help fellow people when they are in need .
I recomend to young people to help people those who in trouble and dont let them tell thanks and ask them to help atleast three people those who are in need and say the thing what i told above .
So that it will be like a chain and one or other day they will be cant see problem people .

By this process we can sevre people those who are really need .
And by doing this it will help our nation be proud and the fellow nation will see us and learn .
And main thing is that now a days young people are seeing that family is nice or not that 's it .
But it is your responsibility to see your fellow community is having problem or not .

9925,1607351.txt,P4,ZHO,medium,"I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seems much better than they really are .
Because I believe that in the business world , the sales men always want to make money in the market , they have to make the products look more attractive than they really are .
There are my reasons as bellow .

First , in the competitive real world , the business man are always tring to make as much money as they could .
In this manner , they have to convinced customres to buy their products .
How can they achieve their goal ?
They will try to over describe the function of the product as it really does .
The product looks more attractive in the advertisment to persuade the customers to buy the product even they really not need it .
For example , I always buy some stuff that I really do not need .
Why I still buy them ?
Because of the attractive advertisments made me believe that the products are more efficient than I can imagine .

Second , the business man have to make their spending and income get balanced .
They spend a lot of money on advertisment , such like on the TV shows , newspapers , magazines , and even on the radio stations .
If they do not over describe how the product is greater than the others , the customers would not purchase it .
In addition , the sales man have to spend money to hire the designers who create the advertisments .
For these two reasons , the sales man have to make more and more money to compensate the money they spent on the advertisments .

To sum up , I believe that the products seem much better in the most advertisments than they really are .
We usually found out what the real product is after we bought it and used it .
It wastes customers ' money to try it if the sales man could truely describe the poduct on advertisment .
"
11254,1845882.txt,P5,ITA,high,"I don-t totally agree with the statement .
My opinion is definitely different from that .
If we go to take a look at the past years we can only see a costant increase in the use of cars and I think it will constantly keep on growing up .

There are a lot of reasons supporting my opinion .
The first is the constant research for alternative energy also to be used in the cars .
In fact a wider and wider area of the planet is under the threaten of pollution caused mostly by gas emissions in the air .

Even if this bad aspect exixts from a lot of years nobody has still found a solution and the result is an always much more polluted world .
Another reason why we-ll never stop to use cars is because we are totally dipendent on them .
We can-t live without them .
For example if I have to go out for an holiday , not abroad , but in my country , I would take my car and not other transport means like train .
Why ?
Because I should stay at its hour schedule and it-s not so seldom that it comes on late .

In my personal opinion a modest advice I can give is to improve the Transportation System in the country .
As a student that has to take the train and the bus more than 5 times a week I noticed a big mess in every means .
They are not only often on late but there are also strikes that cause a lot of problems to peole who have to go to work and should arrive on time .

If we don-t try to solve these problems before , we-ll never stop to use our cars .
I think we should take a look at some other countries where these aspects function better than here .
For example I went to Helsinki two years ago and I never waited more than two minutes for a bus , a taxi or for a train .
Every means was on time and in fact there were much fewer cars in streets !
Here in Italy it-s quite impossible go around our city and don-t get trapped in the traffic !
It-s terrible and sometimes a lot of people don-t have enough patience to wait and they start to scream or do very dangerours things .

But every year nothing is done to improve the situation .
How long still do we wait ???

1724,295607.txt,P8,SPA,high,"I agree in part with the statement , but I do n't think that those are the only two characteristics a successful person has .
In my opinion , those characteristics are strongly associated , if not derived , from self-confidence .
A person that is self-confident is not afraid of trying new things and taking risks .
In a way it has to be a person that knows that whatever happens there is always a way to make things work .

On the other hand , I disagree in part with the statement because there is a good amount of people who have success and not necessarly take risks or try new things , in fact they do what they know well or are especialized in .

Could it be that success is associated sometimes to luck ?
There has been a lot of people , throughout History that they had a good idea , but it was n't the moment and years later it became a reality .

In my opinion , in order for a person to have success a variaty of factors should come together , such as , personality traits , knowledge and the moment or period of time he or she is born .

Success involves a large scope .
A person may be successful in his or her professional life but he or she is a failure in social aspects .
Taking risks and trying new things may be applicable and a desirable characteristic for a person that runs a business , but I strongly disagree that it will be a desirable trait in a relationship .

So , to call a person successful I consider it is important to see not only a part of a that person 's life and in order to have success characteristics do n't limit only in taking risks and trying new things .

11877,1956422.txt,P5,ZHO,medium,"In this statement of choosing if will be fewer cars use than there are today , i think my answer is there will be fewer cars in some places in the world and some other places staying the same of even increase the car using .
The following points are my reasons for my opinion .

The first reason is different countries require different uses of cars .
We know that in the world today , there are different levels of countries .
What i mean is there are developed countries and developing countries or even poor countries .
Different countries require differents uses of cars like China .
China is such a big country and it definitely require lots of cars as it got the biggest population in the world .
Some small countries like Tailand or Canada , they got maybe just one ten of the populations as China , therefore they might have less uses of cars all the time long .

The second reason i think is because cars make too much polutions .
There are millions or even billions of cars in the world .
Everyday we see cars driving on anywhere as a city living people .
In some big cases like HongKong , Beijing , NewYork , these are major cities in the world and certainly as too much cars inside there will be more poluted gas coming out .
People can easily get sick by those gas as it originally come by oil .
Also the plants out in the nature and all kinds of enviroment .
As people start to realize it is important to protect the nature enviroment , i think that some countries will reduce the uses of cars in the following years .
Besides thoes who did a good job of protecting the enviroment and they need car uses , these countries might keep their numbers of uses of cars .

The last major reason for my answer i think is about the new technology .
Today we can almost see computers anywhere in the world , we can see many differents kinds of inventions coming out .
These new things are invented for helping human beings to live better .
I surely to say that it will do same on the cars .
In many developed countries like America and England , German .
There are always new productions coming out , there is now already a kind of car can use by no gas and just by water !
The resource is something we can get easily .
Anyway , my opinion is that as some powerful countries can do very good on inventing , they must reduce the old type of cars before .

In a word , cars are still important in some of the places in the world and some of the places are getting rid of them .
It depends on how you want to use cars and the most important thing related to it , which is the environment .

3906,676302.txt,P5,ZHO,medium,"Twenty years is not a really long time for changing things in the history .
I think that in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today .

Cars changed peoples life , i can not imagine how ours life will be without having cars , cars help a lot for the human .
The reason why i think cars will not be fewers is that people needs it .
We need cars to get to work , school , and other places .
Well , some people will think about other transportations .
That is ture , for a short distance we can walk or ride a bike , and for long distance we have airplanes and trains .
However i think car is much faster than walking or riding a bike , and also cars are really flexable , we can go anywhere any time without a airplane or train ticket .
we will have so much trouble without cars , they made our life easier .
Cars are really convince .

The other reasons is as population grows .
the number of the people need cars will also increase .
For examples .
In BeiJing every day there will be thousands of new cars going to the street .
This also happening to any other big cities in China .
In ShangHai , the numbers of cars increased to fast , and the goverment raise the price for the liscenes plate .
From these examples shows that cars will not stop growing in a short time such as twenty years .
There will be a problem for the gas , because the earth is lack of oil now .
I belive at that time there will be other kind of car for us to drive .
The car will use battery , we do have some cars use battery now , in twenty years these kind of car will be absalutaly advanced .
We also can use sun energy for the car .
These are my point that cars will not be fewer in twenty years , Cars are our friends !

6097,1034522.txt,P3,DEU,medium,"Although I do believe , that lots of people still invest energy and time for their communities , I tend to agree with the statement .
As a matter of fact , even I do not invest time in working voluntarily for the well-being of others around me and when I reflect about the activities of my friends and family , I see no difference to me .

To understand why , one should see the bigger picture .
In times people more and more suffer from economic pressure , in times they have to focus on two , or even three jobs to bring home money for their family members , it is a logic consequence , that they do not have additional time to take care of others .
A good example for this phenomenon is the life style of a univeritz collegue .
In order to being able to afford his studies ( which means : entry fees , course fees , books , ... ) , he is forced to work very hard besides univerity .
It 's just impossible for him to additionally work voluntarily .
And there are lots of cases like him .

But it 's probably not just a matter of possibility , but of will .
People tend to be very focused on their own lifes , their own progression , their careers .
In order to achieve respect ( which in our society is very much associated with material success ) , one has to be very focused one himself or herself .
`` If you want to achieve something professionally , you should'n waste time '' , this is more and more common sense .
And although I believe , that many positive , rather abstract advances arise when helping others voluntarily , I do not believe , that these advances are well recognised in our society .

And as individuality is more and more a maxime at least where I live , it is a logical consequence , that people do not care so much for each other anymore .

4202,729948.txt,P7,HIN,medium,"I certianly , disagree with the statement that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than learning facts , As we know that we cannot creat a wall without a base .
Therefore learning the concept and theory behind it is very important .

Concepts will automatically show the facts in the future .
For instance , if I want to learn a new language then I will first learn alphabets .
I will learn them to pronunce and even to write .
Pronucing and writing letter will introduce me the facts of the language .
How hard it is to learn ?

Implementing the ideas practically will show you the facts and results .

After learning principles and theories from books and expertise , we find them in field whether they were true or not .

5258,913996.txt,P1,SPA,high,"I disagree with the prior statement for several reasons .
When we say that is is better to do this or that , we should ask ourselves : better for whom ?
Is it better for me , for the others , for society as a whole ?
I think that altough a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can be fruitful for individuals , societies rely more and more on specialized knowledge .
And this is why i disagree with the statement .

The first argument is that if a society values knowledge , and ours does , then it should realize that the pursuit of knowledge is fostered by intense research in areas that become by necessity the object of further and further specialization .
To increase our knowledge about things , be it nature , or the social realm , or just abstract math , we need researchers to constantly go beyond what they already know .
It is only by being at the forefront of a given discipline that we can gain more knowledge about it .

The second argument in support of specialized knowledge is that we , as a society - even though there are relevant exceptions - , do not pursue knowledge only for knowledge 's sake .
We use knowledge in order to satisfy an objective , be it the improvement of our societies , or of our health , or whatever it is we want to improve .
Doctors want to heal people , engineers want to build bridges .
Most of our society 's needs depend on specialized knowledge .
Broad knowledge of many subjects can serve the spirit , but the well-being of modern societies requires more than well-educated , well-rounded citizens .

Last but not least , our societies , which we value , as we have already said , need to be sustainable in the long term .
Sustainability - economic , social , ecological - is a complex issue and we as a society need to educate people that should be able to treat this complex phenomena .

These are some of the reasons why we can say that specialized knowledge is better for our societies and therefore that is is better to have this kind of knowledge than having broad knowledge of many subjects .
That said , individuals should be interested in areas in which they are not specialized , because thirst of knowledge is part of being human and it makes our societies richer in variety and more interesting .

2982,518734.txt,P1,HIN,high,"I agree to have a speicalized knowledge on a specific subject rather than having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
According to me , when a child is brought in a school and later to higher secondary school , he is taught all academic subjects which will lead him to a better understanding of this world .

After attending the school , a student has a broad perspect of different subject knowledge with him .
Now a student is capable of using his knowledge which leads to exploration of new ideas in his mind and setting a specific goal of his life .
The student thinks of a particular subject as his interest .
He develops a penchant for a particular subject .
It is in the interest of a student that he works for a specific subject because he will be a adroit and astute student of that subject .
A student therefore plans for his Masters in that subject .
He turns out to be a appropriate person for that specialized subject .
He later on joins research on that subject and he achieve his goal .
According to me , nobody in this world has capability to master every subject in this world .
Even scientists like Galileo , Einstein , Newton , etc. had their own interest and specialization which led to different discoveries in this world .
It implies that if everybody in this world have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects then world would be a boring place to stay .
There would be no innovation around and it would be tasteless .
The versatility of this world would end at its very early age .

There a so many living examples who has supported the idea of having a specialized knowledge on a specific subject .
From Sports to politics , Businessman to Adventurers , there so many people who lives their life for their dreams and their goals .
One of the best living example of my time is Mr. Amitabh Bachchan .
Amitabh bachchan is an actor of Bollywood Industry .
He has did his Bachelor in Arts and joined Bollywood Industry .
Recently , he has been awarded with the Bachelors of Performing Arts .
The ectasy which Amitabh bachchan would be having after achieving this degree would be immeasurable .
I support specialization on specific subject because its brings you immense happiness when you fulfill your goal of that subject .
Considering sports on the other hand , football legends like ronaldo , pele , ronaldinho have specialised in their skills and therefore they are at the peak of their career .

I would conclude by writing that specialization on a specific subject needs high interest in it and hard work to achieve the goals .
A person would achieve more fruitful if he is specialized in a specific subject than a person have a mere broad knowledge of many academic subjects .

second of all , young people hav n't some one to do ; for exemple the day when they hav n't school , young people prefer to sleep long time or to look at tilevision and over .

also , young people hav n't a responsability ; for exemple if they hav n't give the house propretor money heir mather or father wlould pay from him .
In conclusion , older people cannot enjoy life like young people because they have a big responsability to do .

359,64009.txt,P8,JPN,high,"I agree to this statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they know how to do well .
A person who is successful is successful because they have worked hard on something that made them successful .
And being successful also allows you to do different things instead of focusing on one thing because you have that extra time to think about other things .
Trying out different things and taking risks kind of goes together .
If you are trying out something new , you are taking the risk of trying something you have never done before .

Everyone in the world wants to be successful , but everyone has their own opinion on what being successful is like .
Some that it 's money , some say it 's power , and some say it 's having a good life .
But the main question is , what qualifies you to be successful ?
In order to be successful , you have to work hard .
You ca n't just sit around and wait for success to come to you .
You have to act in order to be successful .
For instance , succeeding in life usually involves education .
If you work hard and study really hard in college , or school , there 's a higher chance for you to be successful than the others who did n't try hard .
So in order to be successful , you have to work hard .

When you are being successful , you have the time to try out different things .
You have the spare time to try other things , so you keep trying different things .
After you try numbers of different things , you want to succeed in more things .
It 's kind of like an addiction .
For instance , a successful mathmatician might want to increase his range of what he can do , so he might raise the hurdle a little and memorise the first 100 digits of pi .
After doing that , he might move on to 200 , then 300 , then 400 , and so on .
A successful person does n't try different things .
A person trying different things become more and more successful .

If you are trying out different things , you are also taking a risk as well .
You are taking the risk of being afraid , and fighting with yourself .
Because everyone is scared to do things their first time .
Think back to the first time you rode a bike .
You were scared that you were going to fall , so you had training wheels .
But after you got used to that , you tried something new and took the risk of taking the training wheels off .
This is the fist step in trying out something new .
In order to try out something new , you have to take the risk of improving what you can already do .
This gives you more experiences in life making you a stronger and more successful person .

As mentioned above , being successful is about working hard , and achieving goals .
But in order to do this , you have to try out different things instead of focusing on one thing .
And finally , taking a risk and not being afraid of what 's to come are inportant factors in order to be successful .
Again , a successful person does n't try different things .
A person trying different things become more and more successful .

8519,1338251.txt,P3,SPA,medium,"According with the previous statement , young current people do not have a active role in the society , and I think that is true , but is not a big problem .

In my country is very common that young people do not have any interest in the national economy , politic or culture that surround themself .
They do not want to spend time helping other citizens in their communities .
They have the time , is true , but not for helping .
their `` reals '' interest are friends , video games and entertaiment .

In my opinion , Society has the responsability to catch the attention of this young people througt to differents ways that it has .
Here in Spain , goverment prepare special events for young people : Culture events focus in young people , goverments workers are helping in the schools in order to have more implicated young people , etc .
We have to create some essencial values in the young people in order to they understand the enviroment in which they are living .

But I sure that is not a great problem for the society , because people start the interest in the community when they need it .
I would liek to explain it with an example : If we take a young boy of a development country , we have to ask us : Which thinks need this boy from the community ?
Nothing .
He has a home , lovely parents , cable television , friends , video games , internet , etc ...
They do n't need anything from the community , so he is not going to colaborate with it .

This situation changes totally when young people start uppergrade studies or start in his first job .
They start the contact with the society .
Is in this moment , when young people understand that they are living with a lot of people and we have to talk , work , study , etc , with them in order to develop themself in their lives and in the society .

When young people reach this level , they want to start the colaboration with their communities .

4125,715278.txt,P5,ITA,high,"Frankly speaking this is a difficult question to answer .
I think that a lot of people would like to answer to this question because this involves a lot of economical and social interests .
However , I 'll try to express my ideas .

When I was born ( 1970 ) there were fewer cars than today and even if the fuel is more and more expensive , the insurance is very expensive and cars are not cheap , the number of cars is increasing every year .

This is due to a moderate growth of cars in the more industrialized countries but also to a rapid and uninterrupted economical growth of less developed countries .

The continuous growth all over the world is requiring more and more mobility .

It 's understood that mobility does n't mean cars only .
You may have trains , planes , ships and so on .

But cars still remain the most diffused vehicle that people use to move from one place to another place .

In my opinion it 's also difficult to think about a reduction of the number of cars all over the world .
We can think that in the near future the number of cars may decline in big cities due to the traffic which is already chaotic but this will be compensated by an impressive growth in other countries ( e.g. China , India and other growing countries ) .

That 's why it 's very difficult to agree with the initial statement .

It 's also true to say that we all hope that the number of cars will not bring additional smog .
What I hope is that new technologies will allow a more substainable growth .
Some of these new technologies already exist but are simply more expensive than gasoline .

But I hope that electricity , hydrogen and hybrid vehicles will replace the traditional cars and will give us back blue skies , even in the big cities .

7071,1120968.txt,P4,ARA,medium,"I agree that most advertisements make products seem better than they realy are .
Advertisements are there to attract customers to a certain product .
The product is always displayed in a way where it seems appeling to the viewer .
Sometimes the company advertising the product tend to exadurate in advertising .
They make the product seem to good to be real .
Each advertisement is there to target a certain age group .
For example when advertising a toy on the television certain sound effects and bright colours are used to attract young children making them desire the product .
Therefore the parents take action and buy the toy for their child .
Advertising is the best way to minpulate with young children 's minds .

Advertisements does not include the disadvantages of the product advertised .
The product is always praised and made flawless .
The company advertising a certain good main aim is profit .
Quality and customer service is the last thing considered .
It is rare that you find an advertised product that is trustworthy and is exactly like it was described on the advertisement .

In a conclusion i would like to say that the problem we are facing nowadays is that we are letting those false advertisements affect us , but there is nothing we can do about it as they are every where .
They 're displayed as bulletin boards in the streets , showed on the television as commercials and even played on the radio .
In the end were just humans and the least things affect us !!!

3051,528546.txt,P8,JPN,high,"I gree with the statement that people who try new things and take risks usually turn successful than those who only do what they already know how to do well .

First of all , I believe creativeness is one of the most fundamental essences for human inventions .
All valuable inventions in the past happened because people then were creative in responding to specific difficulties or needs of the situation .
Without creativeness , one needs to abide by the negative conditions or hardship .
I strongly believe one can learn greatly from failures as well and taking risks will eventually bring the person a profit in the long run .

Some people may argue that some traditional cultures are better preserved as they are , and I agree with this opinion in principle .
However , preserving the culture can take different ways than just leaving them unchanged or untouched .
For example , it is often reported that the traditional craftmanship is at danger of being lost because of the change in people 's lifestyle .
In such cases , the tradition can be preserved by adopting its style to the modern ways , still using the accumulated knowledge or skills to make that happen .
Without such challenges , that specific tradition may be at more risk of extinction than taking up a creative change .

In conclustion , I stronfly believe that being creative and ready to take risks is a very important factor for people to be successful , and hope I will be so in the face of upcoming challenges that I may encounter by studying abroad .

by travelling a tour a guide is very interesting evry one .
we can enjoy a lot of things by taking the tour guide , the tour guide is very important in the following situations .

First we can visit all places .
the travelling with a groud led is very critical .
because with out knowing the palces we can not complete our tour sucessfully .
if we take a guide a person who knows all the places where we are going to visit .
with these we can easily visit the all places which are in our tour .
so that the person knows everything in that place what we have to see .
and what are the important places are there .

Second we can save our time .

There are many important reasons why I thik this but I will makes two reasons in this essay .

First of all , it is common that people can get valuable result after they had a hard time repeting errors in the process .
It is difficult that students find the major which make infra result just thinking about realistic problems .
They need to take many different kind of major courses in university .
For example , my first major was economics , however I can be sure of the major .
So I decides to choose second major .
It was mathmatics .
Even though it was hard time but its result was unbelievable .
I can understand economics more detail in class , it causes me to enter Korea National Bank owing to professor 's recomendation .

On top of that , when it comes to finding the most profit major in academic subjects , broad aquisition of many academic subject is essential characteristic .
In my opinion , the undergraduate school is the course of taking various kinds of direct and indirect experience .
It is possible and more efficient to enter specific major in graduate school .
This is due to the fact that students who find the major what he really wants to study and what he can do best above the others can make huge and great accomplishment in his field .
For instance , my college fellows who always take many different kinds of class during our school years was chosen the most influential yong peple in our university .

He transfered his major with architecture and became very creative architect .
In all , to have broad knowledge of many academic subject is better than to specialize in one subject .

Every time you travel and see a new place you get the chance to meet new people , be introduced to a new culture , and get acqaunted with new habits and tradtions , not to mention the food .

Yet Travelling if not planned properly can end up to be a nightmare .
Lets say you have decided to travel to a far-away country where u know no one , and ca n't speak their language , u have never been there , and have no clue on what to expect .

In this case its better to arrange your trip through a travel agent where she/he hooks you up with their partner in the country you are going to , to take care of you and arrange some guided group tours for you to go around and see the country .

This can be the right choice in many situations .
If you are going to a relatively unsafe country , where its not advised to wonder around alone .
If you are worried that you wont be able to communicate with the people in that country because of the language .
If you are travelling alone with no friends or family , and you want to socialize on your trip , being in group guided tours might be a good chance for you to meet people and have fun while site-seeing .
At the same time u gaurantee to get enough information about the sites you visit on your trip , since the tour guide will be briefing you about each and every place you pass by .

As much as this sounds safe , entertaining , and informative .
I prefer to travel on my own .
Something I got used to and enjoy doing .
I tend to find travelling on your own more interesting , and forces you in a way or another to mingle with the locals , to get more immersed into that culture , and get a better taste of that place you are visiting .
Besides , you would be able to follow your own schedule and go and see places you choose to see and not the tour guide planned for you to see .
It would give you the chance to do some research and reading about that place , before and during your trip .
You will be you own master , your own guide .

Our day to day life is already scheduled and going according to a certain plan , when I go on a holiday or travel , I do that to run away and relax .
On my trip , I do n't need to sleep and wake up , eat or shop , according to someone 's esle plan , not my own desire .
Otherwise I will end up not enjoying my trip while the tour guide ends up making lots of commission from each and every single shop or resteraunt she/he takes the group to , and most of the time they are bad choices .

In my opinion , I totally agree about the statement .
I believe that young people really do n't give enough time to helping their communities .
I will argue the statement for some follwing reasons .

First of all , parents nowadays expect their children can get high education , so children 's activity always studying not communities .
Because the society becomes more and more wealthy , parents have much time to take care of their child for their performing in class .
For example , in order to achieve their expectation of education , parents usually take their child to cram school , that really occupy much time for young people .

Secondly , Because of the developing game producing , young people nowadays usually stay home for playing game not go out to communicate with others .
For instance , It is fashion to play PS2 nowadays , young people in order to get high grades in the game , they have no interest to go out or make more friends , and they even do n't have any time to commuciate with other people .

To sum up , Because of the high educated expectation and the fascinating games , young people nowadays focus on books or games instead of communities .
Therefore , It is my preference that young people do n't give enough time to helping thire comunities nowadays .
And I think that is not a good phenonmenon for the future , so we should find some resolutions to improve this .

3616,628917.txt,P3,TEL,high,"According to a recent survey conducted in the colleges of India , maximum number of students have Mother Teresa , who believed `` Service to man kind is service to god '' as their role model .
This very clearly shows what the present day youth feels about their responsibilities in helping others .
The fact that students are organising public marathons like the great Mumbai marathon for social causes , relief funds can serve as clear evidences to refute that statement `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities '' .

Youth , infact are being creative and finding out new ways of solving the problems of the community .
For example , the idea of selling wrist bands , which have become a style statement , worth rupees ten for twenty five and using the profits for the rehabilitaion of AIDS affected shows the innovation and also the response with which the youth has accepted the idea .
The exposure to international culture , more awareness of the existing problems are driving the youth to think and work towards the solution .
The craving for a better and enriched life for everyone is the logo of many youth unions today .

Although , the present day requires to be more competitive at work place , studies or any field in general , youth have their priorities clear and they do have the schedule planned in which they have fixed time for their social work .
For example , I am an undergraduate student but i have my weekends to work for the organisation CRY , which is an organisation working to abolish child labour in the country .
Though i cannot call this two day work for my society enough , but I believe this definitely is no lesser than what previous generations used to do .

The present day youth is infact taking one step ahead .

There can be exceptions but in general younger people are tend to enjoy more on account of their high energy levels and will to live life to it 's fullest .

Younger people are more energetic , fit , enthusastic , experimental , sporty in nature and more excited towards events of life they are facing or they are going to face .
On the other hand older people are compratively not much enthusiastic because of ill fitness , lack of energy , lack of will to do things .
Fed up from their problems .
They do not prefer experimentation or adventure .

When I was of age 6 i always wanted my grandfather to run with me , run my bicycle .
He used to refuse and he used to see my enjoyment by riding bicycle .
I used wonder why he is not being part my happiness my enjoyment .
But later I realised I grew up that he was heart patient and could not afford to run and enjoy like i did .
Age , diseases made him weaker and he was refused to do even simple things that he wished to enjoy .
Younge people can do whatever they wish and this is treasure of happiness .
If one wishes to climb the hill one need to think about it .
But this is n't case when it comes to older people .

Energy , fitness anr not the only things .
Willpower is lacking in older people .
I had one professor who used to teach me langauge calles `` Sanskrit '' .
He was always in demand to give lectures , teaching students .
But now he is 88 and `` Sanskrit '' is something he sepnt his life for .
He is very fit for his age .
But still he is not able to teach students and give lectures even at renowed universities because he do not have that same willpower .
He can ot enjoy something he did for his whole life .

Younge people on contrary can go and party late , they can play , they can race , they can climb mountains .
They have willpower to acheive something in life .
They can try their level best with energy and will and can enjoy their success .
Youngsters have broader vies towards society so they can enojoy what they get without any conflict .
I know my borther who parties every night , goes on trekking every alternate sundays , get good marks , gets success out of whatever he wants to do .
But in same home he lives , his grandmother can not enjoy beyond going to temples and to meet some relatives .
Also younger people can take defeat is something which will make them emotionally strong while older take is as failure .
That takes the enjoying of winning away from them .

Confidence , will , energy these are key points of happiness .
And unfortunately olders don not have them compared to younge people .
So i think youngsters enjoy life more than olders do .

This innovative vision was a success and Einstein had strong physics basis .
Do we need a real ceasure to succeed in one area or do we need to evolve gently to reach a key point ?

First , let 's explain how seeking excellence can bring us to a success .
For example , the computational fluid dynamics activity needs real mathematics and fluid physics knowledges so a person can then think about a revolutionnary concept .
By focusing on one point , we can try different methods to bypass it .
Working on something wellknown helps thinking about the major issue and not about mathematics ' properties .
People who keep doing well what they know are gathering knowledge , experience so they are recognized by other people for this and often called , needed to explain , show , develop this subject .
Finally , as a third point , shall I mention that taking risks is not really allowed when working on a nuclear plant or when driving a war , as human lives are at stakes .

But , many battles were won by using surprising methods like the horse made of wood during the greek Troyes war .
More over , taking space between a concept and our work can lead us to borrow ideas from other areas , like using mathematics for urban planning optimisation .
And this make the concept work .
However , an other reason of taking risks is that most people have too much fear about risking anything they already have .
So you are distinguishing yourself from others and then appear , when succeeding , as a successfull person .

To summarize , acquiring excellency in one particular field is the first step of a successfull story .

There are many problems come up when we take cars .

First of all , there are limited sourses to make cars move .
As we can see on the newspapers , gasoline is running out .
We can make soloer power to make a car moves , but we cannot ride a car when we do not have sunlight , such as winter season .

A more effetive way is to improve the automobile condition .

3191,552796.txt,P7,TEL,high,"I do agree with the statement that it is very much important for the students to understand the ideas and concepts rather than to learn facts .
Let 's take a common example of a student listening to a science lecture .
It 's very much important for him to understand what is dealt about before forming an opinion on the topic .
If the lecturer just put the facts infront and ask him to byheart them it wud be of no use .
The student might forget those facts after sometime as that do not create a strong impression in mind .
But rather if he understands the ideas and the concept behind the topic there is a higher chance he can remember that for a longer time .

Another important aspect is that just learning the facts would not lead to the development of the subject .
It 's only when one gets a thourough idea of the complexities involved in that , one would get an idea of how to develop the concepts .
For example let us take a student doing his project work on developing automobile efficiency .
Unless he knows what are the factors involved in developing efficiency he cannot succeed .
It involves the student to learn the ideas and concepts behind the subject apart from learning the facts .
In most of the cases it 's proven that false understanding of a subject would lead to an irrepairable situation .
And knowing the facts without probing into them always leads to a false conclusion .

Secondly probing into the facts and understanding them also helps a student on a personal front .
In one 's daly life one may come across many complex situations , which if one considers only the facts might land oneself into trouble .
Let 's take an example of a student getting angry on his father for not providing him more pocket money .
The father would not give more money as he perhaps feel that his son is involving in illegal activities .

Access to many different regions is easier than before .
The starting point should be environmental pollution .
If we want to leave a less polluted world to our children to live , may be we can start with our cars .
Here is an idea ; when we are going to work why not driving one car .
Collegues living in the same region can get together and drive to work with one car instead of each of them driving his or her own car .
This is a very common argument nowadays .
Hiring a minibus is an other alternative way to decrease the car amount on the roads .
In today 's world people are more aware and conscious about the nature .

11758,1935920.txt,P6,ZHO,medium,"Some people prefer to arrange a travel by themselves , while others like to join a group led by a tour guide .
I am incline to the later way , becuase a tour guide provides many advantages to me .

First of all , I like to visit a place that I have never been there before .
It will cost a lot of time and energy to arrange a travel .
People have to fingure out how to get to the place they want to , the transportation tools and fairs .
Although , the E-business system provides many ways to book air tickets , hotels , and other necessary facters to modern travelers , it still costs time .
After experience stressful time in workplace , many people do not want to spend a lot of time on exploring tickets on the Internet .
A tour guide arranges every thing of the travel for the members of group .
People just pick up a travel agency , select a travel package , and then pay money .
They will reveive a document which describes the detailed arrangement about this tour .

Second , a tour guide knows more about the place than anyone else in his group , because he is professional agency .
He has led a travel group from many times before take you to the place .
He is trained to know everything for that place .
He can intruduce the history of an ancient building in a vivid way , and tell travelors many intestresing stories that can not be found in a tour guide book .
He learn where is the most valuable place that people can not miss , hence a tour guide can make a proper schedule and spare enough time for that stop .
He also watch the time and takes care of transportation ; therefore , people do not need to look at the train schedule time and time again to make sure that they could catch an right train .

Finally , joining a group led by a tour guide is a way to make friends in travel .
A travel group consiste of people with vary backgrounds .
To talk to unknown people in one 's group allows people to learn many intestresing thing that they can not know if they travel alone .

In conclusion , I believe that join a travel group led by a tour guide is a better way than travel alone because it easy , cost saving , and more fun .

520,95152.txt,P4,ITA,medium,"When we turn on the TV , or the radio , or when we read a newspaper we can see or listen to or read a lot of advertisement .
The advertisement is the process that show a product and try to convince people to buy it .
Mass media are full of advertisement , sometimes we can say that mass-media are maintained by advertisement ( a factory can spend a lot of money to buy spaces on tv , newspaper etc . ) .
Expecially from the 80's / 90's spot 's campaign became very very important to promote products ...
there are factories that spend a lot of money to study how a spot can influence the mind of the people , and how the spot can be an advantage for the selling of the specific product .
The phrase that i 've red is about that most advertisement make products seem much better than tey really are .
I completely agree with this statement .
As i said before , in these last years the promotion of the products became obsessive .
A lot of products , in tv for examples , are shown like the `` PERFECT PRODUCT '' : they are clean , positive , beautiful and expecially VERY VERY attractive .
When i was a little child i remember that i 've seen a spot about a game , i do n't remember the name , but this is not important .
The game was a plastic man with a lot of blades , cars , guns , enemies ...
When i saw this spot i praid my mother for a lot of time to buy me this game , and when she bought it i was really impressed .
The man was smaller , poorer ...
there was only 1 blade and not all the guns that were shown in the spot .
The problem of the spots is not about childs ' games , but is about the lies that are inside of it .
You can lie about a game it does n't matter , but you cannot lie for example about a food , about something that can cause dangers to a person ( like mcdonald 's for example , if you have seen the film `` Supersize Me '' you 'll understand this ) ...
Now i do n't pay attention to the spots , ` cause i know that they lie a lot ...
but all people do this ?
Or i take part to a minimum percentage of people that does n't seem to pay attention to the advertisement ?
As i said before advertisement are really strong and can conditionate the decision of the people ...
and this is a factor that ca n't be left behind .

5104,888168.txt,P5,FRA,high,"To evaluate what will happen in twenty years is a difficult task .
One question is to know if there will be more cars or not .
First we will consider the arguments given to predict a reduction in the number of cars , then the evolutions that indicate a rise in this number .

Nowadays the price of petroleum is in a constant rise .
As the oil reserves are getting smaller and smaller , a oil crisis is predicted in less than twenty years .
So using a car will become more and more expensive .
Maybe people will try to use it less , which means a reduction in the number of cars .

Moreover as the center of cities are now overcrowded , the policie is to reduce the number of cars in cities .
Laws are enforced to limit this number , as for instance in London where you have to pay to use your car inside the city , or in Paris where new public transports are being built .

In twenty years we can assum there will be new and more efficient public transport wich will make car no longer a necessity for people .

Nevertheless I do n't believe in that evolution .
Even if there will be no enought oil to sustain the developpement of cars , other sources of energy now exist and will be developped .
Using biologically made oil , or electricity we will still be able to run cars .

Moreover , if we focus on the developpement of cities , we observe that car is a nessecity if you live in the suburb of a big city .
As ore people will live in suburbs than now , we can guess public transports , even if they evolve , will not be sufficient .

Last point is the developpement of China and India .
Even if there a proportionnally less peple who will buy a car in developped countries , when this two countries will be developped there will be a new market of more than two billiard people !

In conclusion even if argumets can be given to justifie there will be less cars than today , I think there will be ; ore cars .

4656,810302.txt,P1,TEL,high,"Science , for that matter any other field of study , have been broadly classified in to many subjects .
Its important for everone to have a basic knowledge of all these subjects but I think its better to specialize in one specific subject .

Concentrating on a wide range of subjects creates a lot of problems .
Firstly , the individual may not be able to find ample time to devote to each subject .
Secondly , the reader may retain far less than what is required because the details of the mix of all subjects might be really confusing .

We always find that people who make their decisions early and act promptly and concentrate in a particular area of interest turn out to be high performers or high end achievers contributing a lot towards the development of society .
Dr. A.P.J
Abdul Kalam , The President of India can be quoted as a very relevant example in this context .
Dr. Kalam identified very early that his interest lies in the area of space science and technology and started working on it from his senior seondary school itself .
We all know that he had always been a towering figure in the evolution of Indian space programme ever since he joined the Indian Space Research Organization .
He can be a real role model to the young students .

I do feel that an exposure to all the subjects is essential for a student to make the right choice .
It also gives him the confidence to tackle new situations and to effectively put forward a new idea before the general public .
But ultimately one should try to become a specialist in any field of his interest .
In this society I feel one should be a specialist in the field he or she is working to make the other people listen their voice .
It also generates a sense of belief among them over the things he or she is telling them .
I feel its always better to be a master in one field rather than a jack of all .

They are spending fourtune on Televission , Radio and posters .

In my openion I thought before that they are steeling from us by convencing our children in a product i am not interested in .
But by the time I have read and understand that this is bussiness and this is how it worked .
it has some advantages and dis advatages .

Although it brought to us the very new technology , and , it help us by using all of the facilities , but in my openion I think it is wasting for our money and sometimes it is not like what we see in the Televession .

Now aday if you opened the Televission you will spend muct time watching those products .
Even so if you go to the movie theator you will waste so much time watching those products and you were paying to watch it .

In conclussion if I had acompany I would do the same thing because people allways do not have the time to think or to try those things , they would say if it does'nt work well it would not matter because it was cheap or if I am going to returne it I would waste time .

7913,1218175.txt,P4,SPA,medium,"The publicity sells , and if you want that someone buy your product you will make a lot of things possibles so your products can be brought .
If your product is good or bad no one will know it until he or she prove it .

I agree with the statement because there is always a product that isnt good enough to the publicity it has and had been made for it .
But there is always a person that buy a lot of things or products even if she or he doesnt know exactly what it is or what it contain .

However if your product isnt good there will be someone that always buy it because it has something that the other product doesnt have .
An example , a man of thirty years doesnt know what to do because he have less hair everyday , he wake up and he have hair on the pillow then he wash his hair with all the care possibly but the hair is only going down more and more every day he prove all the products but neither function and then there is your product waiting for someone to buy it and it has a lot of publicity .
He has view it on t.v so he think why not im going to buy it so he buy it and the next week he have three more hairs and he is happy and he is now a new man .

However he doesnt realize that it has second reactions and his heart pulsations had been increasind the last three months that he had been using , but remember that he is a new man now because he have hair and its true he have a lot of hair now .
Now that he is a new man he start to run and he went out of his house and run and run but then he start to feel a pain a big pain in the arm so he stop and start to breath a lot but his breathing has been more difficult so he start breathing softly and softly and softly and is calm now .

So he walk to his house and went to the hospital and they said that he will suffer a heart attack and they dont know what is the cause and then he is thinking what it can be so he talk to the doctor and tell him that he is using a new product that allows him to have hair and the doctor saw him and said - you know what , you arent the first that came here for that .

There are a lot of products that seem to be much better than they really are but with that kind of plubicity we cant denied to buy it so we buy it and we tried it but we have to beware about what it is and what it has made of so we cant have that type of problem .

3562,619794.txt,P8,KOR,medium,"Most people are afraid to take risks or learn new things because they guess that it might fail .
However , I believe that try new things and taking risks is what makes a person a successful person .

It is good to have one thing that a person can do well .
However , when he or she learns about a new thing , they can relate what they have learned to what they already know .
In my school , our civics class do the chart called KWL chart .
It 's a chart listing what I already know , what I want to know , and what I have learned , which we filll out after the lesson .
When I take the lesson with a basic knowledge that I already know to learn a new thing , I can relate them afterwards and also , infer factors about the topic .
When someone only sticks to something that they know and how to do it , they will not succeed in society since they do not have broader knowledge than other people in the community .

I strongly believe that taking risks is a best way to succeed .
When people take risks and fail , they can fix what they 've done wrong , and get it right next time .
For example , Thomas Alva Edison had failed alot of times when inventing his light bulb , however , if kept on trying and finally made a light bulb that changed out lives .
If he had stick to the job as a railroad worker and not put his job on risk for what he wants to do , he would n't be called `` the wizard of the Menlo Park . ''

Taking risks can also being sure of what someone is doing .
If someone made decision , he or she should be proud of it and stick to it .
For example , the famous chairman of the Microsoft Bill Gates dropped out of college to start a new world that he wanted .
He did not drop out because he could not follow the courses , but he dropped out because he was sure that he could make this world different .
And by sticking to the decision he made and working hard to achieve his goal , he became successful and got what he wanted to get .
Even though he had the risk of not getting a successful job if he failed , but he came out successful because he stick to the decision he made .
if he just stayed in school like a normal student , our life would n't been very modernized as today .

Being successful is what moast people in the world aim for .
However , i believe that trying new things and taking risks makes a person successful such as Bill Gates and Thomas Edison rather than just doing only one thing that they are good at .

4638,807827.txt,P4,TUR,medium,"Although many advertisements try to make some products seem better , I do not agree with that they are succesfull .
Because the advertisements can not hide the reality .
Also people investigate the products with all details before buying them .
It is not very easy to make a product seem much better than they really are .
So it may cause some problems which customer complain about .

Some advertisements may illustrate that their pruducts have awesome results .
However , the truth can not be covered forever .
If you buy something which promise a good result , you may be disappointed .
Because you want to see the the results which they offer in their advertisement .
When you see the reality which is opposite , you will not suggest this product and it will cause to decrease the number of customers which may want to try it .

Also many people investigate the products before buying .
They read the comments which are about the products and they want to see some formal certificates which guarantee claims of products .
So they do not believe easily to advertisements .
After they finish their searchings about the products , they pay money for the products .

The advertisements are used for informing people about new products and technologies .
If advertisements do not reflect the realities , it can cause some problems .
It can decrease the reputation of products .
So the companies get difficulties to increase their profits .

I believe that most people agree with me .
Since life gets harder and more expensive , People think second time before buying .
So the advertisements can not be very efficient if they try to make the products much better .

3230,559999.txt,P8,FRA,medium,"Since you are a child , your parents , and other facors , teach how do well in your work , or in an activity .
When people grow up , they choose and follow their own way , which can be differents of that way that their parents teach them .
Some successfull person try new things and take risks , rather than other person only doing what they already know how to do well .
I agree with this statement .
People are influence by the money , the own personality .

First , the money has an important impact on someone 's behavior .
The money drives the people crazy .
Nowadays , the money represents the only thing that make people happy , relax and safe .
It means that successful people , people which have a good job and earn money , can try new things , take risks , and have novel experiences .
THey are safe and can pay for the new activities they want to try , or can take risk to play to Casino , for instance , because they are sure to have money after have lost .
It is the same way in the work .
They can take risks because they are succesful and have money .
If they make a mistake , they do n't worry because they have money so they are safe .
However , a person who are no successful and also not very rich ; this person ca n't do what she wants to do , try new things , or just take risks .
It means that all these three facts represent a risk or have to be due to a long reflection .
People without money do n't have choice .
THey do what they already know howdo well , in the aim to be safe and take risks .
For instance , a successful person wants to try something new such as rock climbing .
It is not a probem for her .
In contrary , a person without money ca n't wake up a morning and say she wants to try this activity .
SHe does n't have money to spend in that .
She has to work for that .
It means omly doe what she already know how to do .

Secondly , the personality of each person have a huge influence .
SOme people wants to enjoy the life , everytime , rather than other prefer just follow the cheep 's group , and do what their parents teach them .
After , there are the person who are afraid to take risks or try new things .
They are scared to pass away from the everyday life , and they are simply afraid of what they do n't know .
FOr instance , the person succesful are generally the person narrow-minded , extravageant , who express themselves and want to enjoy the life in every minutes whatever the risks .
In contrary , i remember than when i was fifteen years old i was scared of what i did n't know .
I did n't know it so i did n't if it was risky , good or bad .
ALso , i was afraid if my parents were agree or like this or this new things .
I just simply do what i know do well .

TO conclude , successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
It enjoy the life , become independant , and live iyour own life in your own view of the world .

There are two reasons for this .
They have more experiences and money .

First , older people have learned how to enjoy life from their longer period of life .
They , of corse , have experiences of love with girl/boyfireinds , which sometimes include faiure to success .
Older people should know how to belong with their partner .
For example , my farther who have many girlfriend before marriage , now , has very good time with my mother because he can lead the partnership effectively and can solve probelms easily .

car is very much essential today to do the things in the right time .
I disagree with the given statement that `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' .

In the olden days man used to travel from place to another by walking .
the invention of the wheel chaged the evolution greatly .
after the invention of wheel man introduced many new vechicles for transportation .
he initially used bullock carts , tongas which were pulled by animals .
In the later life he introduced bicycle , which served him in travelling later he introduced motor cycle inorder to reach quickly with less effort , inthis process man thought for luxirious way of travelling and he started to introduced vechicles run by fuel .
he designed some of them for transportation of goods , and some for human , such as trucks , buses respectively .

And he later thought about the luxory and privacy , then brought the cars .
cars were luxirious means of transportation in the earlier .
but it is a compulsory now .
this change had occured because of globalisation and neccesities .
in the intial stages there very less number of cars , people used to see it very intrestingly .
but now days in the developed countries many are having more than one car .

The main problem with the cars is they create alot of traffic problems and also pollution .
for this reason many governments are trying to decrease cars by demanding for more tax , parkingamounts .

But pepole are ready to pay that because they very much edicted to it .
the question is that there will be less cars with in 20 years than now but ithink it will not happen .
the people possessing cars will not throw them out .

There will be many technologies come which will reduce pollution already some are using cars run by solar power .

They can induce you to buy some goods that you do not need or do not consider buying by exhibiting them as if they were much better and more necessary than they really are .
Because they rely on science .

First and foremost , there are some bugs in the thinking patterns of human beings and advertisements abuse these bugs .
For example , they manipulate people by using words with positive meanings which have special impacts on your subconcious .
Moreover , advertisements use some color tricks to persuade you to buy the products they exhibit .
There are particular pscyhological impacts of any given color .
Advertisement makers also make best use of these color tricks to impress you .
Besides , they repeat so-called magic words in advertisements accompanying a vivid tune .
Once you heard one of such tunes , you sing it throughout the day .
This shows how these tunes have substantial effects on people .

Yesterday , while I was watching TV I saw a new keyboard .
The man talking on the advertisement was assert that this keyboard was designed very ergonomically and it could ease the pains on your wrinkles if you are a game addicted .
He also said that they guarantee no disorder for 5 years and a pay back guarantee I you don not like that keyboard .
There was a vivid song on the background and it was obvious that they were meticoluosly chose the colors .
Finally I decided to buy it , but I had no need for it .

Although it would be easy to reject this statement , it 's such a complex one .
Personally , I agree with this statement .
In the following paragraphs , I 'd like to present some examples to support my points of view .

First of all , a successful person should have the following good qualities : creativity and to do something to the best .
For example , Edison invented the electric light bulb .
He tried so many times , and eventually , he succeed .
Without his tring and breave , we might used candles to light up until now .
After he invented the electric bulb , he found that the form of the the electricity might be a problem .
So , he tried direct electric and alternative ealetric , tried to find out which one was suited for today 's usage .

Trying something new is always important for advancing our life .
So , the people try something new and take the risk could be called successful person .
For instance , the invented of the computer amd use it to get on the internet .
Nowaday , computer almost involved in every event , such book ticket , buy clothes , and obtain information .
Without those man tried to invent computer , we ca n't do those things I have describe above .

They might be failed , but in my mind , those who could try new things and take risks are the succesful person .
Althought there is also a arguement in the opposite position to be made on this issue .
Nevertheless , for the reasons I have presented above , I believe my points of view are the most valid .

I 've some knowledge of mathematics and computer science because mathematics is the basis to computer science .

I think knowing ( studying ) deep about one or two related majors is better then having a shallow knowledge about a vatiaty of bounch of majors .
That is because of several reasons I can mention some of them like Any one know that the development in sciences is never ever stops and having new things each day .
So in order to a person to increase his knowledge in the majors he is interested in will required from him to have an incrrideble abilities because as a human Beings it is impossible to have a constant knowledge that can be retrieved and reviewed in our brain .
That was one point another is due to our average age which will not let us to have a very good knowledge about cuple of sciences keeping in mind that when you want to finish your undergraduate study you spend about 22 to years of your age and if you want to complete your graduate study you need an extra 6 years which will be then 28 years of your life after that you need to show your ability in what you studied which required from your years and years of research .
anther thing is that concentration is the most important factor in order to a person to be successful otherwise as a human being he will get lost and will not have a clear idea about what he is hopping to be .

As a society we are a number of persons and each one has to dump a certain gap in order to be a good society and to acheive our qoals as one society whcih follows in acheiving our goals as a one person in a society .

Firstly , more developed transportation than car will be made .
Moreover , people do n't need to move like nowadays since through the internet they will be able to handle their works without directly moving with their cars .

First of all , the new transportation will be made which is much more environmental friendly than cars in thesedays .
Nowadays , cars seriously cause the environmental problems .
Because of the gas released by car , it bring about the destroy of ozone layer .
Furthermore , the increasing use of fuel cuases the human to hardly find energy resources .
People living on the earth have problem which cars influence on our nature environment .
Thus more developed transportation will be made to preserve the nature .

Next , there would be little chacec for people to move with their vehicles to manage their works .
As the Internet grow , people can do their works conviniently .
They do n't have to move much to meet somenone or see the situation directly .
Intead , they can meet people on the internet even seeing each other by screen and have talk .
Also , they handle their work by getting the material by the Internet just on their desks .
This developing of Internet cause people no need to move somewhere anymore .
It can make the less uses of cars .

For these following reasons , cars are no more significant tools for future people .
First , more eco-friendly transportation will be made , moreover the less people use their cars becuase of huge developement of the Internet .
That 's why the use of cars would be decrease in 20 years .

That is my moto in life .
One cannot either deciede to take any one of the above , that simply wont be enough .
As normal functioning humans in this day and age of information explosion , we cannot choose to be ignorant about anything .
Also indepth knowledge about some particular subject is also very important for our own professional success .

As far as academic subjects are concerned , the key word here would be time .
When a person is in school , his subject study should be as broad as possible .
He should learn literature , science , arts , maths and everything else which canbe covered in his curicullum .
School is the time when the brain is developing and the mind is growing .
The child in this time should get the widest exposure possible .

One in graduate college , the course he chooses should be more specific but also include subjects covering wider toipcs .
A medical sciences students should be taught about digital circuitry too as should psychology be included in a course on engineering .
The student must have an option of branching out or even experimenting .
Also having related knowledge only helps in understand how varied information canbe utilized to help in what would seem to be unrelated subjects .

Then further on with post-graduate and research based study the students can aquire more specialized knowledge about the subjects of their interest .

But as I stated earlier , the whole question about broad knowledge or specialized knowledge would depend upon the fact that when is the question being asked .
In relation to a school student , broad subject study is essential and otherwise he would just be isolated from the many different things he could learn and become .

In relation to agraduate student , the coursework needs to have a direction of flow but the coverage of topics should be wide as it shall allow experiment and improvisation .
Then as post-graduate and then doctorial specializations come up the nature of knowledge should narrow down drastically .

But as far as life is concerned , a combination of the two will be elementary to success .
Moreover with increasing pressures on democracy , overpowering multinationals and a growing global marketplace , inormation and knowledge might just save the day .

8041,1244220.txt,P1,SPA,medium,"Although a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can make a person very interesting , I really consider that nowadays the promotion of specialization is better for many reasons .

Firstly , if a person is focused in a particular subject he or she is going to feel very motivated to improve his or her knowledge , because it is his or her election and probably he or she really likes that field .

Moreover , specialization is very important when you are a job seeker , particullarly when you are looking for your first job .
There is not any chance for people knowing many things in a superficial view ; oit is easier to find a job if you are an expert in a particular field .

I can concide that a broad knowledge is useful sometimes , for example when you have to manage a small company with a short staff .
But that is not usually the common case because most of the people work in medium or large companies .
Thus , the proportion of people working under the umbrella of general thinking leaders is quite higher than the number of leaders itself .
Usually a general knowledge is enough to fit properly your specific subject in the framework where it must be insert .

We can consider also this dilemma is the history .
If the modern society have promoted the broad knowledge more than the specialized one , it would have been impossible such a fantastic development .

In summary , although a broad knowledge is necessary sometimes , society had better promote deeper knowledge in the challenges that we are facing , and for that the specialization must be a priority .

Almost 60 percent live in Asia , which is a growing market for the car industry .
Yes , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

According to the market in Asia let us assume that almost every citizien has a car down in Asia .
The car industry is going to be as happy as they were never before .
For instance they are going to raise their annual income to a never forseen hight .
Which is good for the economy of the whole world .
Because the rate of unemployment is going down enornormously .
And every person who is working for the car industry will benefit from that boom .
Firstly the employers live more savely because they are going to have more money to spend for luxury .
But what is more the surrounding economy like the travel branche or the apparel industry is growing too .
These are just two examples I like to indicate .

On the other hand all these cars are going to cause havoc to the environment .
Most importantly to the air because the cars producing a lot of chemical stuff like CO2 which will harm the atmosphere .
According to the atmosphere which is our weather kitchen .
It produces rain , snow and even oxygen , without these elements we are not able to live .
To put it in a nut shell even if it rains the rain is not free of chemical combinations .
So the rain causes harm to the forests and animals and yes even to the whole mankind .
Unfortunenatly none of our well payed scientists have discoverd a system to prevent acid rain , which is the main problem to the environment in which we live .
So it is our task to save the nature for our fellowers .
To ensure this task is going to be succesful we have to put more money into education .

Let me sum it up , more cars of course , but not with more danger to the environment and mankind .
Let us build even more environment friendly cars , like hydrogen cars or with solar power .
Than there will be no harm the the atmosphere and everthing is okay for our future genarations

11568,1901493.txt,P8,ITA,medium,"Success is a very common word that people use very frequently to express their ambitions .
It is probably the best goal someone may have and it can be reached in every field , but how ?

The main element needed to have success is studying .
Studying will always bring somewhere better than where you are now and this is another great goal to which you should always aim at in your life .

Another fundamental factor is risk .
Risk is not a very common word , because when it is used , it usually represents a very difficult and intense situation .
Apart from businessmen , people do n't like very much to pronounce this word .
As a matter of fact , it is mainly used in business discussions .

In economics , risk is what leads to success .
For instance in stock exchanges , no one who has n't ever risked is successful , and never will be .
In business , you are compelled to gamble on tons and tons of factors that will determine the way through of your day and consequently of your life earnings .

There is a great motto that states the importance of this curious behaviuour : `` No risks , no earns ! ''
It is a hundred percent correct and it illustrates very exaustively what people 's behaviour should be like .
Yes , because risks are not to take only in business fields .

Risks are at the basis of worhty living , morally and economically speaking .
If this behaviour occurs , people would not do what they already do well , but they would improve .
Improving implies some risks initially , but paradoxally in the end , it always brings you to riduce risks and gables on your life .

So in conclusion a key advice to be given is : `` Always improve , because in life there is always more to learn about and more to risk on . ''

11948,1970058.txt,P4,JPN,medium,"I often watch advertisements on TV commercials or magazines .
When I watch these advertisements , I always think that these advertisements are too much performance .
The reasons that I think such thing is that I have experiences that there are big difference between advertisements and real one .
Therefore I agree with this statement .

First of all , I watch advertisements on TV everyday .
Actually that advertisements are attracted me .
And then I have experienced that I boght degital camera on TV shopping program .
However when I got this camera , I was really disappointed it .
Because the camera was n't good .
On the TV shopping program , I thought that the camera was good .
However , after getting it , I realized that that salesperson on the TV program explaned it too much .
The person on the TV said that it is easy to use this camera , in fact I thought that this camera 's operation was so complicated .

In addition , when I worked for a bank , we were selling some stocks .
And then our bank was using advertisements on TV .
That advertisements said only good aspects .
However not only me but also my coworkers thoght that that stocks have also risks .
I thought that our advertisments should announce about high risk and high return , and I thought that some costomers must be misunderstand about this investment .
In fact some customers who watched our advertisements on TV misunderstood .
They did n't know risks on this investments .

I have bad experiences about advertisements , when I was customer , in addtion , I felt that our bank 's advertisements where I was working for was much better than real one .
I understand that advertisements are strategy of sale .
However I really think that it should n't do too much performances .
Because many customers might misunderstand .
However , in fact there are many too much performances advertisements in the world .
Therfore I agree with the idea that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

6772,1093268.txt,P4,SPA,high,"Advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
In our twentieth century world , money is one of the biggest issues for most people .
When companies create a product , they want to get to as many people as they can , so they use advertisements on television , magazines , and even the internet in orther to announce their product .
Since companies compete with each other to sell the most products , they have to show people how their products is the best .
Therefore , they use techniques that glorify their products so customers are persuated to buy them .

One technique companies use are subliminal messages .
In the commercials , the companies advertise their product close to something that makes people feel good , such as a nice beach , or a good looking female .
When a person looks at the advertisement , he/she sees the product as better than it actually is , and is therefore persuated into buying the product .
For example , Victoria Secret , the famous underwear brand for females , uses good looking women in their commercials to make other women think that this product will look as good on them .
Companies also over-advertise , so their product gets stuck on people 's minds and when the time comes to make a decision in what to buy , the customer remembers the adverisement and buys the product .

Advertisements can also make products more appealing than they are by adding special effects .
This technique is used specially on food products ; for example , Chili 's , the restaurant , does commercials on burgers and their food , where they put special paint and shiny effects , so that their food is seen as perfect .
They sometimes even use fake artifacts to make their product seem better than it really is .

In conclusion , companies want to advertise their products to the public in the best way possible to they associate their products with things that are not part of the product .
They mislead customers into buying something that is ultimately worse than what the company advertised .

3006,522501.txt,P2,TUR,medium,"I think that young people enjoy life more than old people .
There is lots of reasons for this which are genrally based on advantages of being young .
Let me explain these reasons one by one .

First of all young people not as experienced as old ones .
Because they are lack of experience , everything appears something new to them and they enjoy dicovering these new things .
For example for a young people to go to a new country can be so much enjoyable because he is doing something new .
A new experience which may create unfamilliar feelings .
But on the other hand it is not that much attractive for an old man who had this kind of experience several times .

Secondly young people have less responsibilities which give them more fredom .
A young people generally only have his or her responsibility .
So he can make his programs without depending to others .
He do n't need to take care of a baby or shedule his holiday acording to child 's school like old people .
Fredom is also one of the key words that makes life more enjoyable .

An other reason is energy of young people .
The energy of young people also an advantage which makes them enjoy life more than olders .
When people are young they have energy to do everything .
At it is not only an individual advantage .
As all young pepole have this energy they can create more positive atmosphere than older people can .
So they can also benefit from this advantage by using synergy of group .
They can make parties till late hours , dance and laugh all together .
They are capable of this activities with their long lasting energies .

As a conclusion it is obvious that young people have so much advantages to enjoy the life more than old people but there is no need to feel jelious about it .
In fact sooner or later young peop will get older .
as once older people were young .

10751,1753370.txt,P3,TEL,high,"Personal intrests are far more important than the intrests of the community , especially in a world where it requires utter dedication and hardwork to survive .

In the yesteryears , the world would have been moving at a far more relaxed pace and never this competant .
This not only enabled young people to dedicate their time but also their energies toward their community there by taking it forward .
Not only this , there would have been much less distraction to their work .
For example , if we take a student pursuing studies at a university , he would had to deal with far less competition in his studies .
There by allowing him to allocate certain amount of his time for community activities .
With less population in olden days , there were sufficient opportunities for suitable young people to work at their hometowns - giving them an opportunity to work with their communities .
The young people of the bygone days would never have had to deal with the pressures of contemporary times .
Hence there would have been an obvious amount of time for them to work towrds their communities development .

The situations which the current generation of young people have in their hands are far from what the young people from the bygone days would have had to endure .
They have to deal with constant pressure to succede in life without loosing out much .
And young ones of this generation are often burdened with the responsibilities of family .
This definitely leave them with very little time and energy to work towards their communities .
Adding to this , the everlasting temptation to earn more money and enjoy the luxuries that other seem to enjoy , which in a sense not a negative thing at all .
After all every single indivudial has the desire to enjoy his life to the fullest .

I therefore conclude that , it is not wise to accuse the younger generation of not being able to apens much time for their communities , given the desire their reach great heights in life .

1047,171574.txt,P7,DEU,high,"Today , it is enough for a lot of students to learn facts about certain issues and topics only .
In my opinion it is not enough to learn facts only .
A student has to focus on how to understand an idea and a concept .

First of all , a student should understand an idea to build up his own opinion .
He gathers ideas of several people and tries to make up his own mind .
Understanding the idea gives the student oppurtunities like duscussing about it and create other ideas .

Another important point is the understanding of a concept .
When a student understands a concept he can transfer this pattern to other issues and compare and contrast them or add information .

Also , he can modify different things which he does n't like about it .
Learning facts does n't give students the possibility to consider whether a fact is good or not .
He just learns it and doesnt even think about it .
In contrast , understanding ideas and concepts allows a student to discuss and talk about it because he has enough information about a topic .
Beside this , a fact is not modifyable that means that a student might talk about it but he ca n't add information .

A fact represents statistics or particular issues which ca n't help students to transfer ideas or concepts on other things .
Understanding ideas and concepts make it possible to spread out your knowledge on other fields .
For example , a student should be able to use the ideas and concepts , which he learned during the lessons , to create other sentecnes in a exam .

Youth are very enthustiastic about helping other people .
I can prove my point with real life examples of me and friends are giving our best effort to improve our communities in all sort of ways .
It is a big misconception that youth is inactive in community service today .

First , I have a friend called Ravi .
He is a very busy and diligent student .
He very normal and contemporary .
But , he never allows these reasons to overshadow he ability to perform community service .
He went a eye hospital `` AMG '' in Rajavolu in Rajahmundry .
This is free hospital for the health needs of the poor and needy .
He wanted to give his best effort to support the cause of the hospital eventhough he is very busy .

During holidays for the 9th summer , He became involved in eye screening of the poor school children .
After receving the guidance of a establisted opthamologist he went to screen the children for vitamin A deficiency .
He made a check list of each symptomes for individual child and reported it to the doctor for more medical care .
Next summer he became involved in Glacoma awareness camp .
In this camp he counselled patients and explained the importance of medication for the serious disease such as Glacoma .
These were few for his many accomplishments .

He told his friends including me the joy in giving a `` hand of help '' for our community .
His expriences had a huge influence on us .
We too became involved in various voluntary services .
I became involved in adult education campaign .
Here I taught some illiterate adults basic reading and writing skills .
This experience had huge influence on me .
I could access how valuble education is when I saw the plight of the illiterate adults .
I will never forget this experience .

Finally , All these experiences show that youth definetly involves in community service .
Youth need encouragement and good support from thier family and friends to make this possible .
Youth will realise that community service give a kind of self satisfaction that very valuble .
In conclusion , young people realise that this society is ours and we have responsibility to serve for our societies .

The people are so blindly following the rules which they are kept by there own for the sake of tehre enjoyment and not helping to the communities which they are in need of help and the help which they can effort they can give there hands to the people who are very need of them like denoting there old clothes to the childrens who they do n't have to wear also , they can give some money by buying the product and it help the childern who do n't have the money to go to school and they can donate some money to the hospitals for the heart problem children by doing this type of things they can save the one single life of the children , for this also the younger generation people do n't have time to spent the for this type of activities they will send the money to those things which are useless and they will not get any thing from it they will just wasting of there time by watching movies and spending the money for parties and enjoying with some body and getting some harmfull disease like HIV & AIDS , they most of the people are getting effetecd to this type of disease so are just spoiling there life at the begining of the life .

7497,1160449.txt,P1,KOR,medium,"There has been an argument regarding the issue that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject .
Some people think that studying for one particular subject that they are intrested in is more effective .
From my perspective , however , I believe that learning many different subjects is a more beneficial way of studying .
In this essay , I will present two reasons for holding this opinion .

First of all , studying various subjects can help students decide their future career .
In general , a lot of students have difficulties choosing their career because they are not certain about their interest .
However , by learning many different subjects , students can find out which subject they are most interested in .
For example , when I was in a college , I took economics because I have always been interested in this subject since I was in high school .
However , I soon realized that I have no skills in managing businesses .
After then , I decided to change my major into psychology and I started to enjoy this class so much and now I am planning to be a pschiatrist .

Second , learning differenct subjects can broaden one 's knowledge .
Most people tend to stick to their major when they enter college which narrows their knowledge and experience .
Suppose that one person studied for math for the whole college years .
When that person graduates and get a job , he/she may not have a happy time in his job because he certainly do n't know how to interect with others or how to use the computers or machines .

In my opinion , the purpose of advertisements have already decided their nature - to attract more customers , no matter how to get it done .
Businesses want their advertisements to make a good impression to people , and to lead people to believe that their products are better than others .
I have found numerous ways that businesses use to achieve this purpose .

Some advertisements intentionally give you the `` good points '' of a product while hiding the actual , sometimes more important , limitations or disadvantages of the product .
For example , some credit card company claims in its advertisements that its credit card service has 0 % APR ( annual payment to the service ) .
However , when customers subscribe to the service excitedly , they find that there are actually other fees with different names associated to the service , which are not mentioned at all in the advertisements .
In this way , the company successfully lead people to believe that their service is cheaper than others , while in fact it might be more expensive .

Another way to trick the people watching advertisements is to make invalid or incomplete comparisons with other companies ' products .
For example , some computer retailer compares his computers with the computers being sold by another retailer .
However , it only compares the features that his computers are better at , while ignoring other important features that might limit the performance of them compared to the other product .
However , people who watch this advertisement often have no expert knowledge of what features are important to computers , thus getting tricked to believe what the advertisements say .

Sometimes , advertisements even use deceptive means to attract customers .
For example , a clothes-selling store gives an advertisement that it will give a sale on Saturday .
It then lists several prices of certain clothes compared to their prices a few days ago .
However , the store actually increased the original price to make a bigger difference in the prices , which deceives customers .

There 're many more ways that advertisements exploit to make their products better than they really are .

Taking risks is not always safe , but it can take someone to a higher level .
In the United States there are so many opportuties and so many ways you can explore things in life that will help you to become someone in life .
In third world countries like Africa and Latinoamerica people have to face a lot of challenges everyday in life , because there are not many opportunities in their countries they take dangerus risks such as leaving their countries .
A great example of it are the many ilgegal immigrants latinoamericano that the United States has , because of the difficulties that people have getting a job and trying to provide for their families , they immigrate to countries like the U.S. to try to see their dream come true in life and to make a difference .

If the advertisements fail to show the products ' virtue , why are the manufacturers advertising their products every day ?
It is the basic function of the advertisement .
Comercials are trying to exaggerate the virtue of products in two ways .

First , using the characteristics of media .
Television , newspaper , and megazine are adapting every possible visual effects on their advertisements in order to show the products brighter than they are .
They using lightings and computer based image reprocessing technoligies .
There are lots of new thechnoligy used in the advertisements that makes it possible products can be seen as totally different styles and shapes .
Hence , customers usually disappointed with the real shape and color of the products , Especially for economic product with ceap materials .

Second , showing just good part of the products .
Even though the advertisement do not lie to customers , exposing only the good part of products means hiding the worse part of the products .
Hence , if the public see the advertisements , they may think the products are amazing one without any problem .
It is the reason why some sophisticate customers try to find rates of other customers for the product they plan to buy .
The customers who already used the products can give more accurate information , both pros and cons .
It means customers hardly find bad aspects of the products on their comercials .

In conclusion , I strongly agree with the idea that advertisemens makes products seem much better than they really are .
Although advertisements of products can provide people with information that may helpful to decide to buy them , they are often to lure customers with wrong images .

For the following reasons , however , I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

First , older people have more free time .
For example , older people can retire his job when the people got enough money to spent their least life .
Many older people can spent both money and time for what they want to do .
Some older people can travel all over the world .

It does not matter in which part of the world we live , we can be aware of all the happenings in other parts as well .
Moreover , Media has contributed a lot in the world of advertisement .
Before launching of any product , the company promotes its product with the help of media .
We know the name of a particular product and its significant feature before it is launced in the market .
And as a result the demand of the product increases .
Media plays a major role in successful launching of any product .
The world of bussiness is based on two very important words : `` demand '' and `` supply '' .
Knowing about the product and its significant feature even before its market supply , greatly increase its demand .
But advertisement only add profits to its manufacturers and mislead its customers .

These advertisement introduce these products in a colourful fashion .
We can see most actors and actresses in the advertisement of Soaps , cars and many cosmetic items .
These advertisements lure public and portray that this perticular item is the best as this film star or sport star is using the same .
The manufacturers show only those features that they want to show .
They never highlight all the features of the product so that the customers can have real idea of the product .
Due to the presence of many similar items , customers may have many choices but it is actually very confusing because they only have a vague idea of everyone .
So , these advertisement mislead public .

Thousand and thousand of dollars are spend on these advertisement to make it more charming and colourful .
But the cost of these advertisement is added on the cost price of the product .
So , finally the customer has to bare the cost of these advertisement .
Lets take an example every month a new toothpaste is introduced by the same company by just adding some more fancyful features and attract public through advertisement .
Advertisement full the pockets of the manufacturers and lure the public to spend on the new product .

With all the help a one minute show advertisement is carring to a company , i agree that most advertisements make produts seem much better than they really are .

People who get amused with a certain advertisment that pop out on the television every couple of minutes , in my opinion these people are sick , because they get attracted to a certain product without even knowing what does this product consists of .
Companies try to win our attention with a silly advertisment to convince us , and i ca n't say they dont gain our attention .
Most advertisments make products look much better , and the prove is that when you buy the prcoduct you get shoked with the type of quality and the exaggerated advertisment done for it .
In my opinion all companies sell the same products without even caring wether the product is useful or not , befefitible or not .
Manegers may forget about their conciouns and work for the aim of money .

In conclusion , be wise and pay attention to what is going around you , because you might reach a certain point that you might lose yourself following dreams that does not even exist .

10482,1710562.txt,P6,ZHO,high,"From Columbia roaming around the world in his ship in search for undiscovered exoctic lands , to a family paying a weekend trip to a nearby state , we could see that people have long been enjoying the pleasure of travelling and being a tourist in foreign land .
When you start planning for a trip in the summer vacation , for instance , what is the first thing that you would do ?
Go to the book store and pick a travel book so you can plan your own ideal trip ?
Or go to a travel agency with your family and book an attractive travelling package ?
For me , I would go for the latter .

Booking a trip at an agency means that you are travelling in a group provided with a tour guide all along the way .
When traveling in a foreign place , a tour guide is unquestionably more experienced that you about every aspect of the place - its history , culture , tourist attractions , and anything other thing that a tourist would like to explore .
Imagine that you are going to France all by yourself , without a tour guide , what would you do if you would like to find a place to dine ?
You would surely ask a passer-by for directions .
But the problem is , you do not speak any French !
Even if you are lucky enough to bump into a resturant , you do not understand a word in the menu .
These problems would be all gone if you have a tour guide along with you .
A tour guide therefore , also helps us to break the language barrier by being the ` tranlsator ' because he is very often a local people from the country .

The second thing why travelling in a group led a tour guide is the possibility of cultural exchanges between the members the group .
You may discuss about things you find interesting along your way or even questions as simple as ` where to go shopping tonight ' .
This way of travel also offers a saver environment because a group is less prone to local crimes such as stealth .
Even if you unfortunately fell ill during the trip , there are people around who will be able to take care of you .

Traveling in a group led by a tour guide is no doubt the best way to travel .
You are lead by someone familiar to the place who will explain everything which comes up to your mind , you are with your friends or family which help you out when you need .
In this way , you are comfortable and fully relaxed , and can enjoy the real pleasure of travelling .

11969,1972976.txt,P5,KOR,medium,"I disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
I will present a couple of reasons why I do not agree with the statement .

First , as technology develops , there will be more advanced types of cars in use in a variety of ways ..
For example , in the present time , cars are being used on the road , but imagine the cars runing under the land , that is underground , or yet better , flying and running at the same time in the air and land .
It would be possible to drive a car on the road and air like flying cars as we can see those kinds of cars in the movie .
Technology is becoming more and more sophisticated , and it will make our dreams realized in the future .

Second , there will be alternative power sources available in the future .
People who think there will be fewer cars in use in the future probably considered the current energy problems .
It is ture that the fossil fuels are limited , and other energy sources have n't been yet practical .
However , the possibility of using alternative energy sources such as solar energy and geothermal energy is being intensively studied , and near future it will be much more real than now .
In addition , a number of scientists are currently involved in developing feasible future energy sources , showing a good prospect for the future .

In conclusion , I strongly disagree with the remark that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Automobiles will be one of the best transportation means available in the future as it is today .

639,108543.txt,P3,TEL,high,"I donot agree with the statement that `` Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities '' .
I support my statement with the following reasoning .
It is true that the life syle of man has changed drastically over a period of time and man has to compete against time to go on .
But there are many social organisations that mainly comprise of young people who work for a good cause .
For example , the blood bank in my city has more than 1000 young people as its members .
They organise blood donation camps often in the city and also provide it for free of cost .
One more interesting fact about this is that most of the members are the young software professionals and doctors who inspite of their busy working hours take out time for charity .

Another example I would like to quote here is the HIV-AIDS awareness programme being conducted in the villages where the people are ignorant about the disease .
This programme is organised and conducted by a group of young medical students of which I also form a part .
We stage plays explaining the spread of the disease , its dangerous effects and the preventive measures .
We do all this in the weekends and we are able to bring out a considerable change in half of a village .

Also , there are many Indians settled abroad .
These nonresident young professionals formed into a group and carrying so many remarkable projects in their home land through proper organisation channels .
This offers a best example of the concern of the young people towards their community .

I personally feel that the main constraint to today 's young generation is the time but not the lack of interest to help their community .
there may be a little lack of awareness in them and which requires proper stimulation .

So , with all the reasonings stated above I support my view that today 's young people are not reluctant to help their soceity .
Afterall , today 's young generation implies the future of tommorrow .

3173,550108.txt,P3,ITA,medium,"The topic of how many time young people must give to the communities has constantly been debated in my Neighborhood .
This theme originated at the time of first communities .
In fact , for example , Socrates was tryng to estabilish the best balance between the time that people must spend on their community an the time they can spend for themselves .

Upon this theme there are two schools of thought .

The first one says that giving the time to the communities is not only a way to iprove the community too but also a way to improve the level of knowledge of young people .
In fact , they say , a young people nowadays do n't needs only to be learned by a teacher , but also to have a pratical feedback against to his work .
For example a young person that have studied the painting methods is not really able to paint a ceiling , or a wall , because it needs the experience to do it .

The second one , on the contrary says that , for young peoples , giving time for the communities in which they live in , it is not a good idea .
These because young person might be more interested from these activities than their own studies .
A team of American Psychologists has been observing the way to give time for the community of about two-hundred of young people for two years and they have developped a theory that is in according with this second school of thought .

On balance than , I agree with the first opinion because I think that a young person would became a better person only if he shares his time with the community in which he is living .

2268,391707.txt,P5,SPA,medium,"Nowadays we live in an era were the use of cars seems to be very useful and that we cannot live without it .
In my opinion , I think that in twenty years there will be more cars than there are today eventhough the public transport will develop enormously .

Firslty , the population of the world is growing considerably , this means that on the next twenty years there will be more people reaching the age of having the driving license .

Secondly , as the years go on , the prices of the cars will be lower , the new technologies makes posible to produce cars at lower prices .
This will make posible that a major number of people achive to buy a car .
You wont need too much money to buy a normal car .
Maybe , luxury cars wo n't reach to accesible prices , but normal cars I think that will .

Thirdly , it is shown that going on motorbike in the streets of the cities , the avenues , the autopistas is very dangerous .
Every year the number of dead people driving a motorbike increases enormously .
People is taken conceuous that driving a motorbike is dangerous and that the possibility of having an accident is high .
Moreover , people will tend to prefear to drive a car that drive a motorbike .

Fourthly , eventhough the public transports are beeing improved in comfort , price , distance , etc .
In twenty years it wo n't have developed so much to be able to not have a car and move around the city , country , world by public transport .
Cars will be yet necessary to do day a day things , and to move around the streets .

To sum up , I think that twenty years are no so much to decide not to have any car , maybe in a future , if things change , and the public transport improves and makes more facilities to people may reduce the number of cars .
But in a deadline of twenty years I think that all the factors that I have mentioned before will make to have more than today .

There are some reasons why I think so .
First , I think it is not intresting to just follow the guides when I travel .
I think , however , it is important to find something interesting or something new by myself .
I am happy when I find something that other people do not know and when I find somewhere beautiful by myself .
Second , traveling by myself makes me feel confident .
When I went to Australia .
I went to the zoo by myself .
I researche the fee to enter the zoo , how to get there , what to see .
It made confidenceto me that I can travel in foreign country by myself .
Above all , if the travel is in foreign countries , I would like to travel by myself definitly , because traveling abroad is chance to learn the language or culture of the country where I travel .
The tour guide might explain what is good , what to eat , where to see , and so on , in Japanese .
I think it is important to be surrounded by the air of the place to have best experience .

I do not think traveling led by a tour guide is bad , but the better way to have fun is to travel without her .
I think finding or learning something new is good experience and the experience will never be the same , on the other hand , traveling led by her is almost always the same .
I think people who want to do something different from the otheres should travel by theirselves .

There could be a lot of opponent opinions about this topic and it is n't easy to make an accurate response without studying the real needs people .

Having a knowledge of many subjects usually implies that none of them is known accurately .
Maybe , a person that chooses this kind of education will increase his or her ability to understand concepts from many areas of knowledge more easily than other people .
For example , it 's obvious that a student in Information Technology engeenering have to receive a lot of information from a lot of materias , from Maths to Physics , from Electronics to Computer Science and Automations , that will help him to improve his knowledge in a specific technical field when he will need to .

On the other hand , the impact with the real working life can be require a specialization in a specific field of knowledge , so a person that studied with this in mind , maybe will find work more easily using his specific attitude .
The problem is that if it will be the need to make a different job , a person that concentrated his preparation on a topic only could be find a lot of difficulties .
For example , talking about a student in engeenering again , we know that technologies may change very quickly , so someone that specialized him or her in a field that maybe wo n't exist tomorrow could will find a lot of problems in the working life .

Maybe there is not a better solution .
I think that schools have to help students to improve their capacity to learn new concepts more efficiently and rapidly is possible and to show them more topics is possible about many areas of knowledge that they will study more deeply when there will be the specific need .

3377,585039.txt,P1,FRA,high,"The French government is looking forward to implementing a measure that has triggered an important controversy .
Indeed , they want to enable children to drop out general formation when they are fourteen so that they could specialize in one specific field by attending classes on this subject and making internships .
It rests on the idea that it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
I agree with this idea , even if I would like to nuance it by saying that a basic knowledge of several academic subjects is necessary before specializing in one particular subject .

First and foremost , people may not need a broad knowledge of many academic subjects in their daily lives or in their jobs .
For instance , a baker may not feel concerned by the study of DNA .
People may also be more interested in a specific subject and want to learn more about it .
For example a scientific may be keen on mathematics ; then he will wish to concentrate on the study of this field and drop out a deep study of physics or biology , even if he will need a basic knowledge in these fields since these three sciences interact .
Therefore one can adquire a basic knowledge of several academic subjects and then choose to specialize in one specific subject , in order to become an expert in this particular subject .

Nevertheless , the step during which one adquires a general knowledge about fundamental subjects is also very important .
A law which would allow children to leave school when they are fourteen ay be criticized from this point of view , insofar as it is the period of teenagers ' life during which they should adquire this general knowledge that proves necessary to understand the world which surrounds them .
For instance , they need to have at least basic knowledge of history and economy if one wants them to understand what is at stake in topical issues .
This understanding is of critical importance inasmuch as they will become citizens .

As a conclusion , I would rather say that each and every one of us should decide to specialize in one specific subject which particularly interests him , but after having adquired a sufficient competence in several academic subjects .

69,11923.txt,P3,TUR,medium,"Being a teenager , I have to spend a considerable amound of time with teenagers .
Therefore I am quite aware of the behaviours of young people considering community .
I want to handle the approach of young people to helping community in two basic parts which are education they are having and the era they are growing .

The educational system is one of the important source of the young people 's attitude towards the community .
In the past education system was not only meant giving the scientific information .
However teachers were able to educate the students in every aspect .
For example if a student behaves to a friend or a teacher in a cruel way , that student was being punished .
In contrast today students are telling really discusting world to their teachers without getting no punishment .
Furthermore in the past since the mothers were frequently hausewifes , they were able to follow their chidren 's education .
However today since most of the parents both have to work to make their living , the education of the chidren are most of the time done by comunication devices like television , internet .
These causes the today 's young people to grow without respectful education and they become people who do n't help to the community .

Although education makes up the very important part of the reason of young people 's behaviour towards the society , the era which we are living in , supplies the important condition to make tenageers behave in that way .
Today , there are a lot of things to do in order to spend time which are more enjoyable for young people .
For example once upon a time my friends and I decided to organize a visit to the elderly people 's hause and we were not successful because we could find only three people to come with us .
A lot of peole said they had another plans like going to cinema , doing sports , ..
etc .

In conclusion , it is obvious that I strongly agree with the starement that young people do n't pay enough attention in helpin to community .
Due to the people around me I am able to summarize theit bahaviour 's main reasons which are their lack of education and the conditions of the era they are growing .

0,88.txt,P6,KOR,high,"Some people might think that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is a good way .
But , a group tour normally has its strict schedule and does not offer the tourists in group any chance to meet many people in new place .

So , I strongly disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .

First , a group tour has its own strict schedule and all the tour team members should follow it .
And it means that I can not choose the place where I want go and the food which I want to eat .
For example , when I went to Thailand for the first time , I chose a group tour because I was young and it was the first time to go abroad .
I really wanted to go many attractive shops and spots in the street in Bangkok , but I could n't go there because I was in a group tour and I had to follow the schedule which the tour company offered .
And I had to wake up early in the morning and had to go back to hotel in early evening , even though I wanted to enjoy more sleep in the bed in the morning and wanted to go outside in the night .
It was really bad experience .

Second , a group tour does not offer many opportunities to meet other people for its tour team members .
Becuase a group tour moves together by its tour bus , it is difficult to meet many people in new places .
But if I travel alone , I can meet many people and feel their cultures .
When I went to Tokyo by myself , I met really many people there .
I could talk with them and some of them became my friends !
Even though I could not go a lot of sightseeing spots as efficiently as a group tour , choosing a place where I go and going there by a subway were really exciting experience and Japanese people were kind to let me know the ways .

All things considered , I definitely belive that a group tour led by a tour guide is not interesting or exciting at all .
By going new place alone , we can learn more about the new place and feel much about the people there .

6710,1087713.txt,P1,ARA,medium,"Some people say that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
In my opinion , I think it is good for a person to have a background in many subjects .
However , he must concentrate on one subject which will be his major in college and the field of his job .
Each person should has one specialized subject .
A doctor cannot be a civil engineering at the same time .

There are many reasons why I think specialization in knowledge is better .
First , every society must consist of people that have knowleges about different subjects .
As the human body contains different members that work independently and consistently , the society needs individuals with different jobs and ways of thinking .
In addition , people are different in what they are interested in and we cannot find a person who interested in all academic subjects .
For example , I like computer engineering but hate medicine whereas my brother 's interests are just the opposite of mine .
Besides , human brain is limited and a person cannot be creative in many fields .
This century is not like the past when one scintist , like Newton , was shining in physics and mathematics .

As we have noticed , societies must consists of people of different knowleges and it is impossible to find a person who is creative in many academic fields .
Therefore , I disagree with the idea which says that it is better to study many academic courses than to specialize in one specific field .
"
7840,1205284.txt,P1,ITA,medium,"When we are asked if it 's better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects then to specialize in one specific subject we reach a great problem .
First of all we must be aware that knowing everything about every subject in the world is definitely impossible , so , if the choice is to have a limited knowledge in a large number of subject or a good knowledge in one subject only , we are tempted to take the second choice .
Nowadays we can find so many specialization classes in universities that consequently the request for jobs is becoming more and more specialized .
So we understand that a specialization in one subject is actually inevitable , but it is more likely for workers to have a broad knowledge about different subjects because this knowledge is very important in the formation of a man 's experience as an individual .
Therefore , having a good general knowledge is important in people working life , where different abilities are often required in addition to a great ability in your own specialization .
In addition to it , it is true that a high knowledge of one subject makes easier for people to be hired for specific jobs , but it is also true that this will limit a lot your chances to get a work a little different from the one you have been so specificly trained for .
Having a good general knowledge helps also in social context , because if a parson with a grat specific knowledge is highely considered in the strict environment of his subject , a person with a good broad knowledge will be kept in high consideration among common people in common context of situation .

To conclude , in my opinion , though nowadays a higher and higher specific knowledge is required in our modern working context , it is basicly important to have a good broad knowledge , to succeed in the whole of the contexts of our lives .

7086,1122148.txt,P1,HIN,high,"I believe everybody can not know everything and its not so good to be ` Jack of all trades and master of none ' .
Specific knowledge is very much desired in both professional and academic fields .

Specialized knowledge of the subject is many times indispensible .
One good example would be from field of medicines , where general Physicians are valued but specialist like Cardiologists or Neurologists are indispensible and are the final option for particular kind of treatments .

Too much generalized knowledge may become very superficial and will not be of much help in solving complex problems in specific subjects .
For instance , if we look at the field of science , say Biology , a generalized understanding of all its branches is required but a Taxonomist and a Biophysicists have very less to do with each others and can not help each other in solving their specific problems .

However all this discussion is not meant to diminish the value of general knowledge , as for application of knowledge from one subject in to other requires understanding of both .
For example if principles of Mathematics are to be applied to Biology then general knowledge of both subjects is required .
However it will be done more appropriately if two specialists i.e. A Biologist and a Mathematician interact with each other .

Also i believe that human memory has its limitations and one should use it judiciously .
We should confine and focus our brains towards solving problems related to specific subject .
Too much unnecessary knowldge will occupy space in one 's memory and will not be put to use very often .

Therefore having General knowledge in moderation is good , but having only general knowledge is of no use .
To apply knowledge for usefull purpose one has to specialize in particular subject .

would it affect the way that the person have the taste of the life ?
the answer would be quite different if it was asked to people in different age groups .
however one cannot miss the the viewpoints of most people being young is more fascinating than being old .
in a specific way , young people enjoy the life better than the old people do .
there are numerous reasons for this but to state some , it is clear that in youth , people are more active , energetic ; young people are more curious than old people that leads them to have a chance to get the joy of life .

no need to think much ..
first of all it must be stated that young people have more energy than the old peple .
this is a fact that no one can deny .
being energetic and active makes the young people to have the strength of doing anything that they want .
by this way they can experience lots of things .
for example generally , an old person would not attempt to ride a motorbike but a young person do .
so that they feel the wind breezing on their faces while they go fast and they have the joy of driving fast and as well as the joy of life .

moreover , young people are more curious almost about everything .
for instance the curiousity leads the young people to make a search to find some things new .
the joy of making a search , getting their own results and making some interpretations are very valuable experiences for a young .
to give an example , mostly for travel , old people go only to a place and have some rest there .
but most of the young people do some travellings around the world .
this is mostly a result of their curiousity .
as long as they are curious young people will find some thing to enjoy with , to be happy with .

without any denial , one must accept that the young people do enjoy more than old people .
for young people , being active , energetic , curious makes them to go for the things they want to do .
by this way they take the taste of their life , and enjoy until they feel themselves as young and they realized that they are not done with the life yet .

10018,1626600.txt,P7,DEU,high,"I think it is both important , to learn ideas and concepts as well as facts .
But as more valuable I would consider the learning of ideas and concepts .
Learning facts is very usefull if you want to attend a quiz show or if you take a test to be admittet at a college or university .
These test often just ask questions on facts , but people like me are not able to keep these facts .
If I just learned facts in school , I would be pretty stupid , because I am not able to keep it , I just forget it again .
I do not mean to it but I just can not help it .
Wheread if I leraned concepts and ideas I would know much more .
Facts are less important .
If you remember facts you do not have a conection to other topics , for example if you learn that the world war ended in 1945 what does it tell you ?
Not much , only that it enden in 1945 , but if you learn what causes the war to end and what happend after the war you learn much more .
You can make connections to other countries , for example what happend there after the end of the war .
You would be able to relate these effects of the war to other wars and draw conclusions from it .
If a new war starts you may be able to tell what happends when it ends again , just because you learned these concepts in school .
But like I said above it is also important to know some facts .
Everybody should know when the world war begann and ended , but it just should not be paid so much attention to it .
Especially these admiting test should give more importance to the ability of drawing conclusions from an event than recalling the fact of it .

To come to a conclusion I would say it is more important to learn ideas and concepts rather than facts , they should just be supportive .

When you solve someone 's problem , i think that guys will think you are good because you know the things they do n't know .

They have to be not very pround of it , because if someone is trying to ask you question and you starting to have the feeling like you are the powerful , wise people .
I promise abou that next second you will be in the deep cave , and nobody will think you are a successful person .

Actually , been a successful person is not easy as you are learning somthing .
Learning is very basic to be success , but the way and the attitude you face is very hard to understand properly .
Such as you are a very wise and you know lots of things , but you always think you are the only successful person in the world and you don ' like someone asking you question .
How do you know that everyone know you is a successful person , they will just think that you do n't know the question so you are not able to tell them .

Although cars manufacteurs have increased their production the last decades , there is strong reason to assume that there will actually be a lower number of cars in the future than today .

Politicies of goverments around the world will lead to a decrease of the number of cars .
On one hand goverments will still oppose taxes on petrol and cars .
In addition to an contant increase of oil prices cars will become more and more expensive .
Many people will not be able to effort a car and instead use public transport .

The environmantal issue will become more of a problem and urge people not to use cars as they used to .
I am confident that awareness for the problems of the environment will change the way of behaviour worldwide .
The need for governments ( and other institutions , such as NGOs and also the UN ) to make environmental-friendly polities will become stronger .
This in particually will lead to measures that support public transport , which will make it more attractive to use these means of transport .

Instable economical developments will also lead to a decrease of total numbers of cars .

3632,631638.txt,P2,FRA,medium,"There is no single day without a new commercial with medicine or food that could help the elderly people to keep fit in their bodies and young in their mind .
We are now surrounded by the eternal youthness quest .
But why ?
Do young people really enjoy life more than the older people do ?

We first have to acknowlegde that the general trend conforts this idea .
We easily can find the reasons for it : - from a physical point of view , it makes no doubts that young people have the advantage of their age ...
and their bodies .
They can , for sure , do more physical efforts than the elderly people .
In this way , not all physical activities are opened to seniors .
eg : attractions in an entertainment park .

- Generally , the young people are studying , and therefore have commonly more free time than working people for instance .
eg : school holidays .
This time , being larger , can be alloted to more activities than for the other category .

- An important fact is that most of young people do not have to care for kids yet , and do not have the charge of a family .
Consquently , they can enjoy life more than other people , since they do not have such preoccupations .

From another point of view , this general trend is new : it only makes a while that people get to 70 , 80 or even 100 years old .
3 or 4 generations before us , it was uncommon !
Therefore , the idea of old people was the idea of people staying in a rocking chair , waiting for lunch , having strict scheddule ...
It 's not the case anymore : many older people enjoy life , go to their activities , go out with their friends , and love it !

Another fact is that what young people could find enjoyable is not enjoyable to everyone .
It creates then another point of view .

There are pros and cons about this topic .
And I have to say that I am totally divised on this subject .
I do n't think there is a YES-NO answer , but more a general one which I expressed .

2284,394880.txt,P3,FRA,medium,"Young people clearly do not help their communities as much as they once did .
But their change is mostly due to the change of the whole world and the society we live in .
The last century has seen many technological revolutions such as television and computer and a consequent change was more than expectable .

Now that studies are getting so long for youngs the free time they could potentially spend for their community has been drastically reduced .
Big cities that have been growing all over the world lately have also somehow reduced youngs activity in a comunity so big that sometimes does't make them feel at home .

Now that the world is accessible to anyone and the youngs travel everywhere they loose the sense of home that someone that has always lived in only one village could feel .

That 's why who lives in small cities knowing everyone inside them and staying there for their whole life has a much bigger sense of belonging at his town and is much more keen to help out anyone .

But that is not the only reason .
Something that plays a major part is the education people get from school and most of all from their family .
The new family model in the Occidental world complitely degraded .
Almost half of the over 30 years old people has been divorce at least once .
Their support to the children can only be drastically worse than it once was .

People who grow in a solid family close to their brothers , their parents but also to their grand-parents and their old traditional values will without any doubt stay closer to their community .

I 've personally got a lot of doubt about how this new condition can improve .
I think a moral change is almost impossible and people will have to adapt .
And yet families more reasonable are probably the clue to make a difference .

7490,1159656.txt,P1,TUR,high,"I believe it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because I strongly believe that focus is a very important element for anyone seeking success .
Having broad knowledge of many subjects does not make us experts in any of these subjects whereas focusing on a single subject helps us fully comprehend that subject and have more control over it .
Without focus , there is no direction or goal .

Specializing in one specific subject allows us to research everything about that subject more thouroughly .
It is easier not get distracted by irrelevant information when one has a single issue to deal with than many .

I experienced this six years ago when I started studying fine arts in college and took classes from every department including painting , drawing , sculpture , ceramics , fashion and illustration .
It was exhausting to try to practice all of them together , so I decided to focus on painting which was the one I was most interested in .
Now I am a painter , and I can say I know more about painting than anything else and this has brought self fullfillment to my life .

No matter how some people might think that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better , it is an undeniable fact that we have limited time to spend on each of these subjects .
Expertise only comes from practice and we obviously need time to practice .
To put it in a simpler way ; who do you think would bake better cakes : someone who bakes cakes , bread , croissants and cookies all at the same time or someone who does nothing else but baking cakes ?
I definitely think that the second person would have a much more delicious cake to offer .

1467,243351.txt,P4,ZHO,high,"Have you ever bought something dfferent from the fly ?
How do you feel when this happened to you ?
As a matter of fact , I do agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Because of the developement of technology , businessmen like to use technical ways to make their commercials look attractive to customers .
Why I agree with the statement is due to the following reasons .

First of all , in my opinion , businessmen realize if they want everyone to buy their products , they ought to have a good advertisement because human can be attracted by nice pictures .
For example , I like to eat instant noodles and one day there was a new flavor coming up and when I saw the commercial on TV , the noddle looked like very delicious .
However , after I bought one pack of that instant noodle , I tried it and I found it did not tast like the one I saw on TV .
I was upset about that .
Thus , making a good advertisement is a way that businessmen like to use to attract people .

Secondly , in term of busin , advertisements are considered as the best ways to sell products .
For example , my friend is running a carpet company and before he opened this company , he was asking me for setting up a website for his company .
Ultimately , I did a great job on the task that he assigned me .
When he saw the website , he told me it was incredible .
Moreover , because of this website , he got many customers .
However , in hindsight , the pictures that I put on the website look much better than they really are in that I use a very good camera .
Therefore , advertisements are the ways that businessmen use to sell products .

In conclusion , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are because customers are attracted easily by those beautiful pictures .
Furthermore , good advertisements are also used by businessmen .
In the end I would like to summarize my argument by emphasizing that do not buy those products if you do not trust the advertisements .

9426,1512932.txt,P5,HIN,high,"I believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
The essay will demonstrate the reasons for this First , fuel sources available to us are limited .
Petroleum takes millions of years to be produced from natural sources .
The rate at which fuel is being consumed across the world will soon result in a shortage of petroleum .
The low supply vis-a-vis increased demand will result in higher fuel prices , making it unaffordable for the common man .

Second , there is an increased environment consciousness among the people .
Petroleum drilling can cause many accidents , like burst pipelines , leakages etc. , that have many side effects on the environment .
Also , in countries where pollution norms are not strict , there is a danger of global warming as a result of pollution .
Awareness of environment factors might make people rethink about modes of transport .

Third , public transport is very developed in some parts of the world , and being increasingly invested in in other regions .
There is hardly any city in the world where efficient and well-planned public transport does not encourage people to use it .
Therefore , when public transport is fully developed , many people will use it to save themselves the hassle of a daily commute in cars .

Fourth , trends in the workplace are changing .
Many organizations are encouraging their employees to work from home .
This changed pattern in the workplace will automatically reduce the number of cars on the road .

Lastly , though many alternative fuel sources have been developed , none of them have proved to be viable or successful .
Take the example of hybrid cars that use electricity - despite the government tax subsidies , the cars do not have enough sales .
The reason for this is that the cost of development is so high it does not offset government subsidies .

Therefore , the reasons why there might be fewer cars in use twenty years later are unaffordability of fuel , increased environment consciousness , development of public transport , changing trends in the workplace and failure of alternative sources of fuel .

4944,862534.txt,P8,KOR,medium,"Is there anyone who is successful through a entire history without challenging to a new things ?
I absolutely agree with the idea that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know for some reasons .
At first , trying new things means getting new chances .
Secondly , if they fail , they can learn something that other people never know by their experience .

The first reason why I believe successful people try new things and take risks is about chances and possibility of being successful .
If people just do what they know how to do , that means they will have no chance to learn new things and achieve new goals .
Speaking of business , nowadays if someone wants to start his/her own business , she/he will contemplate about the field that other people does n't try yet or is not varified enogh about the success .
Trying new things somewhat means seizing an opportunity .
It 's clear to take high risks in a new fields but once that business get a right way , it also can get much more success .
The higher risks are , the bigger success will be .
If there is a someone who just follows the familliay way , it would be safer and esier but success , the result , would be limited in return .

The other reason why I think being successful requires to try new things and take risks is learning new things .
In a challenge , there is a lot of possibility to fail .
However , people can learn lessons or new knowledge from that failure .
This experience is never exchangable with anything .
It also can be a sturdy foundation of their next step .
Most successful people got through the severe failures but they never kneeled down to that bitter experience .
If people could get over it and learn something , they would be successful with it .

8360,1306607.txt,P3,ZHO,high,"I agree that young people nowadays do not offer enough time to helping their communities .
Considering too many entertainments in their environment and too many academic assignments in their school , and too less timie to rest , young people certainly spend insufficient time on their community-related tasks .

First , it is too many attractive entertainments in our modern society that make young people indulge themselves in these entertainments .
For example , in my dewelling city , there are full of all kinds of entertainments , such as pub , movie theaters , and department stores .
The young people spend their each weekend and holidays on shopping , seeing the movies , and playing .
As a result , they have less willingness to devote to their communities .

Second , it is a great number of school assignments that prevent young people from attending community affairs .
Today , young students have more homework , assignments , and quizzes to complete than before .
Because of the more accessibility of of knowledge and information , young people are required to do more practice and take more examinations during their education , which reduce their possibility to join communities .

Finally , it is lack of enough resting time that young people might not have extra energy to engage in the community affairs .
For example , in my country , young students have to attend cram school after formal school classes .
Also , they are expected to take various art or music classes only because their parents ask them to do so .
In this case , they could n't have enough time to rest , not to mention that they plan to help their communities .

In summary , I agree that today , young people give much less time to helping their communities for several reasons , which may be mentioned above , too many time on entertainments and school assignments and less time to rest .

9421,1511467.txt,P3,KOR,medium,"It is debatable whether young people give enough time to helping their communities these days .
Some people say that young people are dedicated to help the poor live vividly giving lots of donations and sharing difficulties with the difficult in our society .

However , I disagree with the idea that young ages are pouring their time into sharing difficulties and helping their neighborhoods because they are likely to concentrate on their private things such as enjoying their lives , earning a money , and studying some subjects .

In addition , the traditional culture in our society such as sharing our foods and adversity is likely to disappear very quickly nowadays .
First of all , young generation has a hard time to find free time .
They are very busy and they put their all energies to their private sectors .
For instance , my brother who works for Hanyang hospital in Korea as a doctor concentrated on his job .
Even when I invited him to my housewarming party , he did n't participated in the party because he had bulks of schedues such as surgery operations , meeting his professor , and studying for some exams .
Not only he cannot help their communities but he is also unable to find free time for our family .

Second , I believe that the atmosphere in our society is changed recently due to rapid development and strong competition like survival game in movies , which might make young generations disinterested in other 's problems .
Especially , young generation did n't experience the hungry eras from 1950 to 1970 when some our people were starved to death .
So , they did n't know the issues of the poor who are now starving and do n't pay their tuitions .
some people say that in our traditional society , our ancestors firmly believe that the first priority in our life is virtue , especailly helping our neighbors live happily and overcome their difficulties , However , nowadays most people tend to be not careful about other 's difficulties .
I agree with that idea and our educational ministry should try to make effort to announce the importance of helping the poor for our young generation .

In conclusion , I think that young people should put their more time into helping our communities financially and emotionally .

i agree with the following state ment successful people try new thing and achieve better reults when compared to the people who always thinks the same results in the people who want to achieve success they may have suffered with many problems but they didnt for get about their goals .
IN their mind their will be certain ideas they will implent the ideas on their new tasks they will definately acquire good results ( success is the next step for failure ) in their minds always new thoughts and ideas will alway roll in their mind if a person wants to succed in life he should be dedicated toward 's his work he should be optimistic , his maturity also plays a vital role in his success .

success people if aproblem has arise in their task they also know how to over come the task they will develop a character that it will not be able to distinguish by the people who think same , success people are the people who dare to do everything even though if they are failure in their task they know how to overcome from the problem they ill again try for the same task success people are the people who invent the new things they all of a sudden not became success in their life they had gone several up and down in their life , they had spent many sleepless nights they had worked for the people they lets take example telephone is invented by alaxader graham bell if the telephoen is not invented how the communication is made possible ?
with the invention of telephone we can able to talk with the people who are staying in other country 's .

5623,986733.txt,P5,HIN,medium,"I agree to the fact that there will be fewer cars in a twenty years time from now .

I support to this point because there has been an increasing amount of awareness about the rise in the number of cars in the city .
The streets and roads have become more crowded and there is more difficulty for the pedestrians to walk on .
There has been surprizing increase in the number of road accidents lately .
Not only this , more cars mean more pollution and more pollution means more global warming , which is a hottest issue in every country .
Becasue of the problem of global warming , people are favouring to the concept of travel through buses and trains .

People going to offices have resorted to going more than one in the same car rather than each one going in his/her own car .
This greatly reduces the pollution and expenses of a person , furthur leading to the decrease in the number of cars on road .
The railway network connecting cities and metro railway network with a city is supporting to the travel of many people throughout the day .
Being cheaper than the cost incurred upon using own vehicles , people are resorting to such options .

I oppose the argument of the increase in number of cars because of many of the reasons stated above .
Moreover , the increase in cars on the raod leads to havoc and doesnt give a good impression of the cleanliness of the city .
Recently , in New Delhi , there has been an increase in temperature in the summers than the earlier years owing to more pollution in the city .
After the starting of metro railway , many people use this reliable , safe and easy service making a commendable impression on other cities .
This has caused an acceleration in the making such decisions to lessen number of cars on the road in other cities .

Concluding , I feel optimistic in the decrease of number of cars in use in a twenty years time owing to its much awaited advantages and long lasting effects both for a safe city and for a better nature .

It 's a common sense to understand the point cause people who are successful and well experienced in whichever field they are would want to try and explore new things for their benefit .

For example , successful businessman would n't hesitate to take the risks of establishing a new firm or company caused he already knows what 's involved to built a company .
And even if it turns out to be a failure , he would n't have much problem to start all over again with all the financial backing and the knowledge and expertise that he has .

they are not bothering about the communitie they are living around them .

I have a friend who is doing her job in MNC 'S .
Nowadays she is earning a lot of money in the job. & now she is suffering with lonelyness & she thinkking about something bad .
Getting enough money makes pople like in the better way , peacefully .

we should have enough time to help others also i.e ; in the society there will the `` poor & the rich , good & the bad '' . we should transform some money to trusts that will help the people .
helping may not be financial it may be physically also .
doing help physically helps the people more energitic in their daily life .
we should enjoy the life but it should be of some extend only .

Throwing lots of money in the pubs & restraunts is not a good habit .
It may spoil the health also .
spearing sometime with the destitutes knowing their problems is agood habit .
We mat noy solve them but we have chance of making them happy .
the problems are get ridden by telling them to any body by the side of us .

Communitie means `` Group '' .
It is not a single thing or single person .
Helping a person in a scocitey means helping the world to build .

Everyone has a different point of view , about the idea of learning .
It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
These are my following theses .

Firtly , students go to school to learn something .
Teachers are teaching them to us but we do not awere what they are .
For example , when I was a student in a high school .
My teacher learned me but he did not want me to understand them .
Because of this reason , sometimes I do not understand clearly my lessons at my university .

In addition to this , to understand concepts can help us in future .
If we understand a subject , we never forget it , because we cover it all .
We know every thing about it .
For instance , we are in a math class and a teacher learns us a formula and he provides it for us .
If we understand it how we can obtain it , we always remember the formula .

On the other hand , to learn facts is neccesary fo people .
Something can not be undertand .
They have to be learned facts for students .

I try to explain my opinion about these topic .

On the one hand , I agree with these statement for commercial products .
Because advertisements are mostly very common way to recognize some of the commercial products to community .
When you see any product in any advertisement , you always meet good characteristics of the product .
Any advertisement do not mention about any negative characteristic of the product .
if you try to sell some product you must say the good characteristics of the product .
If you explain the some of the wrong or disorder characteristic of the product you can not sell it easly .

For example when you watch TV you never met any advertisement mention about some side effect of some medicine , some foods , etc .
Any hamburger restaurant do not any adverticement about how dangerous is feeding with fast foods but we know when we eat much more hamburger we take weigth .
If we apply morgage to buy a home we can met some bad situation when we do not pay montly bill .
But any of them do not explain these un nice results of the commercial products .

However on the other hand I disagree with the statement .
Because some of the advertisements are for the human services .
For example : Child care center , nursing home or any hospital , etc .
These kind of advertisements try to explain the programs ' facilities , how peole get the services , etc .
Most of the these kind of advertisements give rigth informations to take the attention of consumers who need the services .

But trying new things is a wiser choice i go with , because it opens new windows and gives a new solutions , trying new things and taking the risk in some situations can also make a big difference in the decision taker 's life , furthermore , taking the risk and trying a new thing is important when the man stuck facing a new problem he never had been through before .

Opening a new windows while trying to find a solution is such a relife from pains caused by prolonged thinking , because taking the pain away clears the mind .
When someone stops at a point in his life that needs a real brave decision he cant just look behind to search for an old situation or advice , it can make a difference .

While people consider taking new decisions a risk , i consider it as the opportunity that never came to anybody else and it is some times gives more that the man expects .

On the other hand , doing what the man used to do , or doing what the comunity likes to do is to some extent safe , also its considered the area of experience , the things that u know how to do well .

If no one of us tried to take the risk once in his life there would be no steps taken forward , everyone will remain in the same place after a year or ten years .

Therefore , i agree when they say that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , because taking risks opens a new windows , find a new solutions , gives a new experience , and changes the man 's life .

But the first answer is what my opinion .
There are numerous reasons which can represent .
i will only discuss some of them to represent my opinion as follows : first of all , the reason is that young person can play something which thay feel cery excited , but the old people can not do that as young person .
Their body can not endure this kind of activities .
and thay may think that kind of activies is not very safety to their children .
for example , children like exercise the hardest action which will make them difference with other people .
tehy may sometime be hurt when they do that .
but they will be well in a few minutes .
but the old people can not .

second reason is that young people always like fashion .
thay like go shopping when they are play on the street .
and thay want to buy son \ methings very expansive which make competiton with others .
but the old people will never do that .
they may be think that the young people is watering money on shopping .
thay think that the clothes is not very important for them .
thay only need some clothes to wear .
it is ok .
and thay want to save money .
thay buy somethings which is cheaper than others .
the young people may be feel that the old people is so stupid to do that .
thay think we should enjoy our life more exciting when we was living .

third , the young like to play with the friend outside .
for example , thay like traveling throughout the world which can make fun .
but the old people may not like traveling .
thay may be think that it will be so tired things to do .
thay preferred staying at j \ home to traveling .
and they have to do a lot of homework when they was stay at home .
the young like to see the movie when they were at home .
but the old people may think that is a boring things to watch the movie .

according to all of the reasons above is represent my opinion that the young people enjoy life more than the old people do .
some kind of the old people may enjoy their life .
but not a lot .
so i hope that the old people can enjoy their life more interesting .
because the way can help them more happy and may be the health will be good .

11082,1816396.txt,P4,FRA,medium,"The issue of advertisements may be considered in different ways .
It is often believed that the purpose of advertisements is only to make people aware of the existence of the product .
However it is also true that , in some cases , advertisements make products seem much beautiful or much useful than they are .
Taking all aspects into account , I strongly feel that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

The first reason for my belief is that advertisements always show products in a beautiful environment with people who seems very happy , who do not have daily life problems ...
I think that this fake representation of life make people want their life to look like advertisements and to achieve it ...
they have to buy this new product if they want to have a better life .

Another way to justify my point of view is that making products seem much better than they really are is consubstancial to the purpose of advertisements .
Indeed , the aim is to make people think that they MUST buy this product , as a result advertisements have to convince people that this one is better than all the other one .

Last but not least , I am firmly convinced that the aim of advertisements is not only to make products seem much better than they really are , it is also to brainwash people in order to make them interested only by material things .

8679,1366352.txt,P8,SPA,medium,"`` Extreme Succesful People ''

The people who tries new things and take bigger risks than usual , are not always succesful and not always people that do not take risks are unsuccesful .

I think that the succes of one person do not depends from if the person is so intrepid or not .
This is , people can take many risk or try new things but they probably can not reach a bigger succes from whose they do not .

In my particular experience , I met people who does only one thing but they do it as well as possible .
And people who see this kind of dedication to work or whatever , recognizes the effort of person .
And this is a way to know if a person is succesful or not .

In the other side , person who tries something new can reach succes but if he or she is alway trying new things , never could do really good .
This is a person can do many many things and maybe people say `` Oh this man knows a llittle bite of everything '' , and this is right but i say : `` yes , he or she knows about everything , but he can not do a single thing in a perfect way '' .

Another reason i consider is , that people sometimes do things only to have a little of fun , and they do not dedicate time to improve things that they are doing or knowing even if they take the risk of do something totally new and that it appears the best thing they can do in their all life .

These rasons are why I think the succes of a person do not depends only if they take risk or not , the main reason for me to become a succesful people is `` Dedication '' , this single and simple words involves , in my opinion , they manner in which a man must be if he wants to be someone to whom people recognizes .

4123,715034.txt,P2,ITA,medium,"I agree with the statement for the following three reasons :
First : being young implies still long time to live .
Young people are always full of expectations and hopes because they know there is a lot to live for them , so they can make plans for the future and hope these plans will come true .
Older people have shorter expectations of life and for this reason they are not as hopefully as young people .

Second : young people have always more energies and a better healt .
When people are young they can do a lot of things , for example playing sports , going to see new places , living far from home , going on long holidays , staying up all the night .
They can do all of that because they never get tired and their healt helps them to recovery fast .
When someone is old , for example , ca n't play sports because of his bad health and would be risky for him to go on holiday in certain places such as deserts or high mountains .
The fear of dying caused by their bad healt and their age makes them act with more care and enjoy less the life .

Third : young people has n't seen many things yet .
This give them the joy to live and to make new experiences .
If they are very young they still have to fall in love and make a family .
This two tasks make a young person more happy and full of hope .
The idea of a family is very strong for young people and make them appreciate the life .
An old person have already exerienced these things and ca n't enjoy life as a younger person would .
Furthermore it is not the same if they fall in love again , as it was the first time they did .

For the previous three reasons I think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

8923,1415206.txt,P4,SPA,high,"what is the purpose of advertising ?
selling .
can you sell a bad looking product ?
definately not .
to sell , you need to make your product look good or even beter than it really is .
that my friends , is exactly what advertising does .

if you show bad quality , you 'll be broke .
juan perez just opened a burger restaurant .
to promote his restaurant , he makes t.v. advertising , on which he shows he 's burgers .
the burgers are totally nutritive , but their their look makes people think they are disgusting .
evem though the burgers are very rich en vitamins and proteins , nobody buys them .
finally , juan goes to bankruptcy on his restaurant .
but do n't worry , this case happens in very few advertisings .

it 's all about the look .
companies such as mac donald 's , burger king and wendy 's , which sell the same type of products juan did , worry more on the way burgers look rather than the way they really are .
for example : it is proven that the big mac has an excessive amount of fat and it is very detrimental for men 's health , nevertheless , when someone watches the tv commercial on which the big mac appears , the first thing that comes to his orher mind is `` that burger looks good ! ''
.
the way the big mac is shown has a huge difference with the way it is in reality .
this strategy is done by almost every advertising company in every part of the market , not only food .

it is completely obvious that products are need to be shown in an `` almost perfect '' . almost every advertsing companies do this because of one single reason : if they do n't , they do not exist .
this means that they will suffer juan 's problem .
the principle of advertising is exposing the best part of the product .
and if ther is n't , well invent it !

5818,1010664.txt,P8,ZHO,high,"I do agree with the statement `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' , for the reasons that being adventurous can expand one 's vision , and help one catch new opportunities Firstly , trying new things and taking risks can expand one 's vision .
The course from good to great of the world-famous company Well Fargo is one of the best example to support this idea .
Well Fargo was a indeed American company for the reason that it pays only 1 percent of the entire attention of the company , to its international department .
One day , the top leader of Well Fargo took a big risk : he place the company 's chief CEO , who had been in charge of over 60 percent of the entire business of the company , in the international department .
Everyone was confused with the decision of the leader of trying new things .
However , Well Fargo succeeded .
After several years of the replacement of their chief CEO , Well Fargo became not only a big American company , but a huge international business as well .
The expansion of vision enabled Well Fargo to reach out and became a great company , and make its leader a successful manager as well .

Secondly , trying new things and taking risks can help one catch new opportunities .
Living in a fast-pacing world like this , we faces new challenges every single day .
If we only stick to the daily routine without getting to know this world better by trying new things and taking risks , we will surely be left behind by those who are more adventurous .
With closed eyes , we may never reach the destine opportunities even when they are just knocking on our doors .

Ready and willing to try new things and taking risks , one will finally become successful from mediocrocy .
Starting from today , our new lives with open minds will bring us something amazing sooner or later .

8366,1308844.txt,P6,HIN,high,"I do not agree to the point of view that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .

First and foremost I believe that when you travelling in a group with a tour guide you have to make a lot of compromises and are restricted to the sites that are covered by the tour guide .
These sites that are covered by the tour guide may not necessarily be the sites that I may be interested in .
Also you may not be able to spend enough time at a certain site if you desired to do so .

Secondly the loss of privacy and freedom when you are travelling in a group would kill the enjoyment of the trip .
When I travel for pleasure the last thing I want to do is to stick to a schedule set out by the travel group or the tour guide .
when you are travelling independently you can set your own agenda and can be completely flexible about it without affecting anybody else .

Thirdly in this day and age of internet , I do not feel the need to rely on a tour guide for information about any place .
I can get all the information about a place that I intend to travel to , on the internet and can then make a decision on what places interest me the most and than plan out my trip accordingly .

Lastly there is a general perception that group travel works out cheaper financially than if you travelled independently .
I do not agree with this idea .
With the availability of several internet based travel agents its almost always possible to get great travel deals on travel , hotels etc any time of the year to almost any place in the world .

For the above reasons I firmly believe that travelling in a group with a tour guide is not the best way to travel to any destination .

4998,870916.txt,P3,TUR,high,"Today young people give enough time to helping their communities .
Young people , thus , the new generation between twelve and thirty years old do their best to help their communities ; for instance , they organize several activities together : they visit old people on holidays , and bring them gifts and food .
They give free private lessons to small children in their communities .
They get involved in some youth clubs , and call writers , scientists , artists , musicians , or other people who have an impact on the society , to give a lecture in order to exchange some ideas with them .

Besides , at home they help their parents or other family members : they prepare the table , clean the house , wash the dishes ...
If a family member is ill , they visit this person .
By working part-time , they also gather money for the poor in their community .
They do all of these activities , as they study and work .
Sometimes they work part-time , because they want to contribute to the family budget .
They buy their needs with the money they earned .
With the rest of this money , they help the poor in their communities .

However , many young students have to study hard to pass their extremely difficult exams , and get high marks .
When they have exams , they may sit just concentrared on these exams , on reviewing the material that was presented them in class , or they may spend their time reading several scientific articles , or books .
They study also for their communities , as they have to be distinguished members of the society in which they live .
They study to learn and to help their communities .
In their free time , of course , they assist the work of the older members of their communities ; for example , think about a twenty year old girl , studying biology : she studies when she has exams , papers to write , or has to make a class presentation ; if this girl is Jewish , when the Jewish New Year , Rosh Ashanah , arrives , she will visit the poor of her community , and distribute food to the old poor people of the community ; these are the same things as what a Christian girl does on Christmas .

They are some advertisements of some product , and with these windows they have your attention .

1064,174723.txt,P1,DEU,high,"Since a long time at universities and elsewhere a discussion is going on on how the education of people should be organized .
There are basically two different ways which have an important effect on the quality of people 's later way of working : You can build your education on a very wide basis and try to collect knowledge of as many academic subjects as possible .
Or you can do it the other way round : You can specialize on one specific subject and try to get as good as possible in it .

At first we 'll have a look at the method to try to gain a broad knowledge of a variety of academic subjects .
With this strategy you are able to see how things are connected to each other , in which way they work together or influence each other .
This later makes it unlikely to you to produce products that work fine in one special way but do not fit the needs of a large number of customers .
When developing products you will have an eye on each group of customers , on the companies aims , on the nature , and so on .

However , a big problem of the previous mentioned strategy is the following : If you are good at practically everything you can not do very well at anything .
So , in fact , you have to gain a specialized knowledge of the topic that is most interesting to you .
In this way you should be able to achieve very good or even outstanding results .
This can bring you , your company , or sometimes even humanity one step further .

In my opinion the best solution lies in the middle of those extremes .
Specialization is good because you can not perform very well if you do not have in depth knowledge .
On the other hand , if you just have knowlege on one specific topic , you can not see in what way your decisions influence other areas .
So you should specialize on one subject and try to get basic knowledge on other topics , at least on topics related to your subject .
"
932,154577.txt,P1,TUR,high,"Due to the current level where science has reached by means of content and achievement , it is obvious that you need to specialize in one particular area rather than dealing with different fields .
In otherwords science has all its resources from the academic studies and subjects and moving them to a next level by means of continuing this progress for the commonwealth , we need to focus on one specific subject while being aware of the influences of the other related fields as well .

When we consider the politics as an academical subject , we cannot separate it from sociology or related social sciences .
Therefore we should be aware of the sociology in order to study politics as a science or an academic subject , however in order to be succesful in the related academic subject , this line has to be drawn very carefully by means of knowing where to stop .
If we take a look at the people who are specialized in their academic subject , it is very common to see the examples of above model since all subjects in certain limits are effecting each other , sometimes supplementing , sometimes resulting in contradiction .

On the otherhand the definition of any academical title requires very deep knowledge which should make our way into having a broad knowledge of one specific academic subject which we are specialized rather than dealing with different subjects .
The professors in universities realizing academical studies is a good example to be considered at this point .
But as discussed above we should not ignore the above model in terms of having at least a basic information about how the other subjects effect our study .

History is also another factor to be considered in terms of comparing the examples .
Many sciencists had worked on particular academical subjects in order to progress themselves and accomplish their responsibility against the humanity by inventing different devices , offfering different thesis which are still lightning their followers .
Such as Edison , Einstein and many others are good examples of this heritage .

Consequently the academical subjects has to be handled one by one or specifically in order to be more innovative and useful for the humanity .
In my opinion , past is the best mirror supportting this approach .

1989,342533.txt,P3,JPN,medium,"I agree this opinion and think there are some reasons for it .
Before I state possible reasons for that , I explain why I think young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communmities .
In my own experience , I did not attend community activity like cleaning or helping older people very much .
I think it is not only my case but it hold true of other young people around me .
Therefore I feel this opinoin is true .

Then why this happen ?
It is often said that local community bond was much tigher before and people help each other and give much time to helping thier communities .
For example , if it is hard for a family to take care of their children or elderly people , other families near the family help them .
Opposite is also done .
If there are some problems , local communities helps each other .
I think it worked well before .
That is so-called give and take spirit .
Moreover , there were not TV games or computers , so children played with neibours .
That helped children to mede friends with other children or communicate other adults members of the community .

However , thesedays such community bond bacame weaker .
I don not say it does not exsist at all , but few community works well .
Because society bacame rapid and young people busy with their own work and prefer to do thier own things .
They lacks time and also lacks effort to join .
That is a problem .

Therefore if this tendency continued , it would cycle generation to generation .
I think we have to see our comunities more and engage in helping .

868,141650.txt,P7,ZHO,medium,"I think it depends on the age of the student .
For young students , like secondary and high school it will be more important to to know about ideas and concepts .
Students at this age still at beginning stage or we can say learning state .

They have learn much more theories to support their opinion in the future .
Even they may learn from what happening in the history .
By learning theories , students will think about what will happened in the application of the theory .

While the older students , at university for example , have to learn more the facts .
They may create new ideas or concepts from the facts they get .
Without ideas or concepts , students will not know whether it is right or not .

Older students should apply the theories they get in real life .
Then , by knowing the results , the new ideas or concepts will come again and create new results .
This will be worthfull experience for stude For example , they are two kinds of cost in production , fix and variable cost .
Fix cost should not be change at any sum of productions .
But when we increase or quantity any certain level , the fix cost will change .

Thus , ideas or concepts and facts support each other .
Learning from the facts will not be useful without knowing the ideas or concepts .
Because some of the facts may be come from ideas or concepts .
The plane can fly is the fact .
How the plane can fly came from the concept of researchers in their good calculation when making the plane .

10186,1656271.txt,P1,TUR,medium,"To have a knowledge of any academic subject is very important because we can learn how to think in an academic way with this type of study and thinking in that way make us to ask questions about anything in life .
There is a lot of subjects to specialize but i would choose to specialize in only one specific subject and this can also help me to learn how to ask .

Acoording to me , if you decide to learn something , you have to give all your energy to it , and this helps you to notice and understand every detail about the subject .
Because every detail has a reason and these reasons take you to the profession on the subject .
The point is , you have to understand and feel the sense of your subject .
With studying the regular parts and then studying the details , you can achieve in any subject .
Moreover , how much time you spend on your subject is the other important point .
Due to the changes , you should keep on studying and develop your researches .

If you decide to specialize in subjects more than one , it will be difficult to research all the meterials , actually details ..
I can give a primitive example that i decided to apply for the conservatory in U.S. , and they want me to give a recital , take the Toefl andpass the musician placement examinations .
First i started to study for all of them at the same time , but after a while i realize that i forgot some details about each subject , and start to study one by one .
This helps me to finish all the work .

Although i can not allienate myself from both sides , i would choose to study for only one subject and got the broad knowledge of it .

12077,1994717.txt,P5,FRA,medium,"I would love to believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
But it is sad to see in human history that most times we have made the good choices too late .
However two major contemporary problems seem to support this opinion : the huge ammount of air pollution caused by vehicules all around the world and the fact that we are running out of fuel reserves .

Which means that basicly we should stop using our cars as much for the sake of the environment and we are going to have to anyway in the future .
At least in what concerns cars as we know them today .

So the question is : why are n't we changing now the way our vehicules work since we are going to have to do it anyway ?
Why not find today an energy that would keep our cars running but would n't pollute ?

The truth is that modern technology is able to do that - cars that run with electricity or solar panels exist - but the finantial intrest of these massive gas and oil companies seems to come first .
I once heard a sentence that resumes this attitude .
Two oil investors , one says to the other : `` One day with all the money we make from industry we will be able to clean up the environment '' .
But this is simply not true .
At one point it does become too late .

We have to act now so that in twenty years there will be indeed fewer cars that cause pollution .
This transition can be done today with significant changes .
For example , why should every member of a family have a car when one is enough ?
We should all start taking the bus .

3186,552202.txt,P8,JPN,medium,"I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
To discuss it , I need to difine the meaning of `` successful people '' for me .
Successful people are people who found out their meaning of life .
To discover it , the process of seeking is neccessary .
The process is the same as trying new things .
Trying new things takes risks .

I call people who are doing same things without taking risks as `` unsuccessful people '' .
It is because they do not live their life thoroughly .
They already stop seeking .
It means they are loosing their chance to find the meaning of life .

It is difficult to find out what is the best thing to do for them .
Therefore searching it is very important factor for thier success .
For example , Michael Jodan , one of the most famous basketball player in the world , was used to be a baseball player when he was a child .
When he entered high school , he started to play basketball .
Then he realized it was the best thing to do for him .
However , he was not sure about he could become a professional bascketball player .
But he tried it and made it .
He retired already , but everyone of basketball fun remenbers him vividly .

Another example is Roger Federer , No.1 tennis player in the world .
Like Michael Jordan , he also did not know he was good at tennis until he became a journior high school student .
He was not a strong player before then .

Finally , as I stated above , I believe trying new things with taking risks are important element for successful people .
Life is not an easy thing .
To succeed in the real meaning , I have to keep serching the meaning of it .

11243,1844384.txt,P5,DEU,high,"With this essay I will try to explain why I disagree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use twenty years from now .

When one looks at consolidated automobile markets such as the USA or Europe , one finds that even though the number of cars in use has not increased substantially over the last decade , neither has the number declined .
Even though other types of fuel might substitute the gas used nowadays , there is no sign of another , more effective way of transportation .
Therefore it is very likely that the number of automobiles in Europe and the USA will remain constant for the next twenty years .

On a worldwide scale , I think that the number of cars will increase drastically over the next two decades .
Emerging countries , especially in the Asian region such as Singapore are showing two-digit growth rates in the number of cars used .
Even though this development will eventually slow down in these countries , we will still see substantially more cars in these regions in the future .

While only looking at consolidated or emerging markets one can already imagine , that the number of cars in use will not decline within the next twenty years .
There are however countries such as China or India , that will be the major drivers of a stark increase in the number of automobiles .
These two countries alone make up a great part of the worldwide population , while the majority of people in these countries do not yet possess cars .
In China we can slowly observe what will happen in both countries in the future .
Namely an immense increase in vehicles .
The development in these two countries alone will lead to a dramatic increase in cars used worldwide .

As a wrap up I can say that I do not only disagree with the statements that fewer cars will be in use twenty years from now , but that coming two decades will show an increase in automobiles used worldwide .

11982,1974664.txt,P5,DEU,high,"It is important to know a lot about economics and social sciences to predict in an appropriate way if the amount of used cars will decrease in the next twenty years .

Is there any lack or shortage of cars in our society ?
It seems that every family and also every lonely living person has at least one car .
Additional cars are not required for the private use .
Because the population in my native country ( Germany ) is not growing any more , it is likely to agree to the statement so far that the number of used cars will probably not increase .
It could stay constant .

Other questions concern the alternatives of driving a car .
Travelling by train is still very expensive in Germany - the high prizes for petrol are not worse .
Our train system still has to solve many problems ( too many trains are critically late , sometimes they are overboarded ) so that the possibility to use a train instead of a car ist not very attractive to many persons .

One completely different aspect is the availability of petrol in the future and how fast an adequate substitute can be found and introduced .
Maybe in twenty years , it could be the privelege of a few very rich people to drive a car , because the little accessible rest of petrol will have .

How much cars are needed for the industry ?
And what is the tendancy how the indostrial need for cars will develope during the next twenty years ?
Here I have to display my lack of knowledge .
Many articles , chemical components and other things have to be transported from one place to the other .
The disire that the economy of a nation should grow for it 's own ` heath ' does n't suggest that cars could be less needed for oconomic purposes in twenty years .

As a summary , it is visible that there are many different tendancys and developments which make it almost impossible to predict the amount of used cars in the year 2026 .

When we r specialized in one subjects we can apply the concepts in the real world .
By studying about the different subjects some people cannnot know the concepts in their aware subjects .
Most of the people are intersted to do specialization in one subject because some willl show more interst in their specialized subject .

By studying about one specilized subject one can grasp many ideas form that subject .
by know tooo may subjects is waste because we cannot grasp the concepts in different subjects .
The familiar in one subject make theman a scientist .

In conclusion , doing the specialised in one subject is better .
By knowing one specialised subject we can challenged to the real world by our concepts .
We can tackle the subject more and more .
We can apply the fundamentals and we can invent many many kinds of concepts in that field .

5712,1000545.txt,P6,FRA,high,"I strongly disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
Eventhough organized tours are usually cheaper and more convenient , I think traveling by your own is a richer experience for several reasons .

The first reason of my belief is that organized tours bring you to the most touristic sites .
These places are over-crowded by other tourists , and as a matter of fact , attracts also many local merchants that sell small commodities at expensive prices on all your way .
For example , in my trip to China , the tour guide showed us a part of the Great Wall called `` Badaling '' .
The place was full of people , I could hardly walk up the wall , it was very unpleasant !
On a second trip , I went myself to another point of the Great Wall , which was further to the city than Badaling , but there were much fewer people .
Also , the scenery was much more spectacular .

The second reason why I hate organized trips is that you do n't have the choice of the timetable .
Every visit is precisely scheduled and we should not stay overtime otherwise the bus or tour guide would leave you at the point it dropped you .
A visit of the Louvre museum in Paris is not worth if you can only appreciate the `` Mona Lisa '' painting , and not contemplate the other , less famous , paintings .

Last but not least , I strongly believe that the most interesting part in travelling is when you make contact with the local people .
In my trips to foreign countries , I learned a lot through the visit of the country , but I also learned many things about the culture through conversations with locals .
It may be disgusting to see Chinese people splitting in the street .
But once you understand that they do that to reject bad elements ( such as those coming from pollution ) instead of keeping them in their body , you may find it smart or at least understandable .
Communicating with people , that is how you begin to respect their culture .

To conclude , as per my experience , I always recommend people to make a trip by their own and not with a guide .
This is the best way to discover , understand and respect a culture .

543,98534.txt,P5,ITA,medium,"In twenty yers we will live in a different world in which we will have completly avoided pollution by wasting less natural resources as possible .
In my opinion , we have already experimented successfully the methods to reach this aim consuming everyday less oil and using more bicycles and pubblic transports .
As a matter of fact the cost of the bus ticket is going down because people is starting again to consider this way of transport as a valid alternative to his own car and as an easiest possibility to save money ( nowadays , the cost of oil is growing too much and , on average , only 2 persons per 5 are available to spend a lot of money for it ) and to avoid to be stuck in the traffic of the city center .

But refusing to drive cars and choose to go to work by foot or to reach university by bicycles is also a good motivation to keep in haelth and to do an everyday-life gym without spending any money which can help us to mantain younger and good-looking as long as possible in order to teach our children or grand children to respect nature and to improve our physical attitude simply by using an alternative transport to cars .

In fact , cars ( as we are used to think of them ) are doomed to be fewer because we will improve the prototype for different way to give locomotion to them .
Recent studies have asserted that is possible to make cars working by involving hydrogene insted of oil and it could pollute and cost ever less than a traditional car .
So , I am sure that cars in twenty years will disappear and we will be able to support the missing of alternative transports better because technology is working to give us the best of itself in order to improve the quality of our life .

I do agree the statement that '' young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
Young people have more energy , they do not have much things to care only the time to play and also they are new to everything , while the older people do not have time and they care a lot for things and they already have known everything .

First of all , young people have a lot of energy to spend .
They can do whatever they want because there are very little things that can stop them .
Only mothers or the sun set will stop their having fun .
Even they get sick , they want to sleep in the street , not in the bed which is in the inside the house .

Secondly , in the begining of the life young people do not have much things to care .
They can do amazing jokes or harmfull actions to each other , but nobody will take those activities seriously because everyone know that those things is done to have fun not to harm or make sad the other people .

Besides having energy for everything or having not much things to care , young people are new for everything .
When they open their eyes to the world , they saw the world as a new place that have never discovered .
So they want to discover the world and while discovering the world they learn new things which makes them not only happy and but also make them to go on discovering the world .
Learning new things make life more better fot them and they enjoy in this better life .

In conclusion , the world is waiting to be discovered by those young people because the place is new for them , they have energy and they care only to be happy .
Being young , means starting a new adventure and every beginings of an advanture is more enjoyable than the endings .

4041,701414.txt,P7,ZHO,high,"Nowadays , there are numorous debats on whether or not understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning the facts .
From my point of view , I agree with the statement that It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
The following reasons will support my opinion from three perspectives .

First of all , ideas and concepts are the foundation of the facts .
In addition , in the most textbooks , every chapter begins with the terms and definitions of the ideas and concepts .
At the begining of every chapter the professor will ask students to understand every terms and ideas which is included in this chapter .
Because every subjects have some speical terms the students did not hear before .
If they do not understand these ideas and concepts , they will have a lot of difficulties to learn the facts about these ideas .

Secondly , understanding ideas and concepts will help students to learn facts more effiectively and efficiently .
When the students understand and memorize all the ideas and concepts which they are going to learn about , they are get ready to accept the new facts related to these ideas .
Forthermore , they will familiar to these facts by the means of they understand ideas and concepts .
All of these will help students to learn the facts quickly and correctly .

Thirdly , students learning facts indicate to memorize the concepts correctly and accurately .
In the school , the first objection of students are learning the academic knowlege which refers to the ideas and concepts .
Later , they will use these knowlege in the working place and connect the ideas with the facts .
Therefore , in the school students should concentrate on the ideas and concepts , meanwhile , they can use the facts to help them memorize the ideas and concepts accurately .

To conclude , understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts .
Firstly , the facts is based on the ideas and concepts .
Secondly , understanding ideas and concepts is a good way for students to learn the facts .
Lastly , learing ideas and concepts will more beneficial for students achieving their academica goal .
Therefore , students should make a great effort to understand the ideas and concepts , then to learn facts .

2217,382511.txt,P8,TUR,high,"In order to be successful , people use methods , in accordance to their personality , problem solving methods , and style of life .
Throughout history , we see people who became successful by simply doing what is done before , or taking the way no one have taken before .

To start with , I can say that majority of people try to be successful with using already established methods .
Some have the results which are supposed to be had , some even fails to apply a method , and some had extraordinary results due to various reasons .

As an example , I can say that Sir Alex Ferguson , Scottish manager of Manchester United football team , is one of the most success people that I have ever seen during my life .
He is having his twentieth season as the manager of the club , and he not only had several achievements as a manager , but also honored by the Queen by being given the honorific `` Sir '' .
I can also state that he is having the same type of managing since the first day as a manager , and never gave exceptations from his rules , his tactics and his managing style .
We all witnessed his fights with his squad 's star players , like David Beckham and Ruud van Nistelrooy in order not to make any exceptations .
He was the same when he used to manage the Scottish club , whose name I cannot remember at the moment , thus , i can say that he is simply doing what he knows how to do well .

On the other hand , there are also people who had success by trying things that were never tried before , andd taking risks .
For example , Austrian psychologist Sigmund Freud , who is also called father of psychology by some experts , tried a lot of new things , claimed many new things about the human psychology , and founded the school of `` psychoanalysis '' .
He added new terms to the literature of psychology like ; id , ego , superego and defense mechanisms .
He tried his own methods with his clients , and certainly was very successful at that .
There are many theories whics have their basis in psychoanalysis , and many theories were constructed in opposite to pschoanalysis .

To summarize , I believe that it is the person that becomes successful , no matter what his \ her way is .
If he or she has the strength and puts enough effort , there is no reason not to be successful .
Just have faith in yourself , and and you are half way away to being successful .

1648,279212.txt,P8,ZHO,high,"Poeple strive for success in many ways .
Some people specialize in what they already know how to do well .
Others , however , are brave enough to try new things and take risks .
Given the fact that we are living in a rapidly changing society , I agree that successful people are the latter ones who continuoulsy change their paths of life .

Firstly , trying new things and taking risks often leads people to see new opportunities .
The technology and business are changing fast .
If people stick to the old ways of thinking , they may be left behind by the society .
So we should be open-minded to the new environment .
For example , Bill Gates , the founder of Microsoft , took great risks when he decided to quit from university and start his own business .
That was indeed a very brave and insightful choice for an undergraduate student to make .
Because Bill Gates seized the new opportunity without hesitation , he gained great success .

Noy only can we have new opportunities by taking risks , there is also higher rate of return .
When people only do what they already know how to do well , they have little room for improvement .
Thus they cannot gain more for themselevs nor contribute more to the society .
In contrary , high risks often implys high rate of return .
Those who try new things often get more because of the risks undertaken .
My Marketing professor , for example , changed his career several times from amanager to aconsultant to a professor .
He really gains much life experience and at the same time makes good fortune .

As stated above , trying new things and taking risks would bring people valuable opportunities and good return .
We all live in a increasingly competitive society .
That is why we should adapt to the changing world by changing ourselves .
is exactly the way that leads to success .

387,69111.txt,P3,HIN,high,"As the countries of the world progress into the 21st century , the ever-increasing complexities have yet again slapped the question of time-management on the face youngsters today .
However , I feel the young people of this century have responded splendidly by ensuring enough time for all activities .

The youngster 's of today are vibrant , dynamic , filled with an ever-increasing enthusiam to perform , achieve , aim high but in all this they still maintain their standards and attitude towards life .
Various qutodian examples of this can be citied from our society .
Renowed writer and Booker prize winner Arundithi Roy is a classical example of this .
She has not only helped in the cause of the ` Narmada Bacho Abhiyan ' ( for saving the river of Narmada in India from pollution etc . )
by preventing the formation of a dam that would have hampered the flora and the fauna of the region tremendously but has also added fuel to the fire by gainings wide-spread public sympathy and amenable opinion on this .

The founder of ` Microsoft ' ( the No1 software firm in the world ) , Bill Gates has contributed tremendously towards various social causes like building up Cancer hospitals , adopting entrie villages after the Tsunami earthquake and promoting education at all levels .
This would have definately required him to take out immense amount of time from his work and he stands as a perfect example with whom the youngsters of today relate .

A very qutodian example can be cited as that of my own society 's ` Help the Needy ' organisation of which I am an active member .
This voluntary organisation aims at heping not only those ( humans and animals ) who are needy but also aims at spreading similar feelings and enculcating in the youngster 's of today the very essence of helping their community .

At ground levels , it can be seen that the youngster of today are striving to help their communities and society as a whole by ensuring reforms are enacted and implemented correctly .
The youngsters today are intelligent and discerning and they know that by helping their communities and societies they are actually helping in making their own future better .

4115,714276.txt,P1,DEU,high,"In general it is always difficult to decide definitely for one possibility .
Because both of them contain some advantages but also some disadvantages , it would be the best to decide for a mixture .

Whereas a broad knowledge of many subjects refers to the ideal of humanism which has been supported for a long time and partially is still being supported , specialization is a phenomena of modern time .

We are living in a time of change .
Scientific and technical progress have coined the last century more than any time before .
With the term `` globalization '' I only want to mention one of the new challenges we have to master .

As a reaction on these changes the idea of specialization has developped .
Today , there is much more discovered than in former times so you even have to learn much more to get along in a certain profession or academical direction .
As a result specialization is definitely necessary .

Nevertheless I regard a certain broad knowledge to be absolutely necessary for everyone .
Our world is so complex and also complicated that people have to know the essential things about almost all subjects to give an reliable feedback for example to politicians leading a nation .
If people are not as well educated there will be the risk of creating a society leaded by a few people not thinking about entire people 's problems .

So I would prefer a mixture of generalized and specialized knowledge .
All People should learn the most important elements out of all academic subjects .
In school there is the possibility to do so .
Later they might decide to be teached in one subject and in subjects related to this chosen one .
After that , people may really specialize in their subject .

By this way it would take a longer time until people start working but it surely would be an advantage for society .

210,36300.txt,P7,ZHO,medium,"Understanding the ideas and concepts than just learning the facts are more essential for students due the different interestes , understanding and efficiency .
People have different interestes in different areas .
Therefore , they focus on different areas .
Sometime , people care more bout the reasons than the facts .
For example , they learn about the cause and effect of an event rather than jumping right to the conclusion and just learn the facts .
By doing this , they get more familiar with the topic .

Besides different interestes , understanding towards the topic is equally important because once people understand what the topic is mainly about , they focus more on the additional information about the topic .
Also , when people understand the ideas , it is easier to learn and memorize them .
Therefore , understanding towrads the ideas are required because it makes people think more and learn more .

Time is another significance factor .
If people start on the unfamiliar topic right away without previewing or understanding the ideas , it takes much more time to acutually learn the facts form them .
For example , if people previews their lessons before class , they know what the teacher is going to talking about .
Therefore , they can understand the concepts in the class rihgt away without taking another reviewing time later .
Also , during the class time , they can ask questions and have good interaction with the teacher .

In conclusion , it is more important for students to actually understand the concepts than it is for them to learn facts beacause of different interestes , understanding and efficiency .

5690,997923.txt,P2,HIN,medium,"When we are young we are more energitic , more powerfull , more encouraging and also more willing to do new things in every part of life .
So i think yes young peoples enjoy life more than older people do .

People who are older cant enjoy that much how much younger people can .
Younger people can go for trip like rock climbing , rappling and all which old people cant .
Because of there heart problem or even they get tired very easily because of there age .

Normally old peoples dont go to collage for studies and all where young peoples have most of there fun .
They can new friends , go for parties with friends , can go for trips and all .
Which old peolpes cant do because of there health .

Take an example of new year when every young peoples go for parties and all , then they came late at night and again on other day they go to collage with that energy and again have fun which tell us that life is more enjoyable for the young peoples .

Normally each and every young people like to drive bikes and car very fast , they know that its very dangerous and even i know that they enjoy that also .
Which after an particular age they cant enjoy .

Even you can see in live world that every rock star , actors and good dancers are normally young .
There can be old also but mostly they are young .
Even all cricketers or athlics are young who can enjoy sports in that particular age limits .
This all tells us that more or less young people enjoy more then old ones .

So from all the points above we can note that young enjoy very much more than old peoples but every old goes once from young .

11513,1891040.txt,P3,ZHO,medium,"There is on doubt that , young people play as an ever-increasing important role in our society , because they are more creative , active and vigorous than adult people in many aspects .
However , I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .

First of all , young people nowadays pay too much attention on their study .
Because of the more and more competitive educational circumstance , young people are indused to spend a great deal of time on study and preparing for exams , decreasing their concerning about other things such as family chore , community activities , to name a few .
For instance , my community holds a feast festival on the moon festival every september ; unfortuneately , the date is close to young students ' mid-exam , there are very few young people helping to organize the feast , not to mention attending the feast .

Moreover , in the recent decades , people tend to have only one or two children in each family ; accordingly , young people nowadays do not have many siblings to get along with .
The phenomenon leads them to more self-centered individuals , rather than team-work persons .
They care much more about themselves , such as school achievement , personal pleasure and interests , evaluation from peers ; namely , some public affairs like community service is not likely to draw their attention .

To conclude , young people indeed plays an important role in our society in that they are the future generation , and what they tend to be meaningfully influence what our world is going to be .
I believe that young people are more intelligent and creative than adult people ; also , they are sure to make our world better .
But , if young people can concern more about public affairs to learn the spirit about teamwork , contribution and mutual help , they can contribute to our world much more , since our modern society cannot operate through independant individuals , but cooperation .

2052,354293.txt,P2,HIN,medium,"`` youth is blunder , manhood is struggle , oldage an regent ''

This quatation do realy set out view towards essay .
I think older people can enjoy their life more then the youngs one .
For me age doesnt matter much when it come to the enjoyment of life .
Each thing that young man can do , so can old man too .
The following essay will clear out my point of view

Firstly , the experience the old person have , for me the experience is the mother of wisdom , so if your more wise more easily you can overcome the hindrance in your life .
Old people are more aware of the outcome of the life , the phases of their life which they have beenpass through .
yes i do agree that young person do have more agility , fitness then old man do , but if an old person have kept hin fit by various exercise then he can also be like current youth

Secondly , the way you consider the enjoyment .
If the young person thing the enjoyment in life is going to pubs , disco , then way could not the oldperson can go towards this place .
what majorly differ in young an old preson is their age limit and age effecting their ability , but I do not think age can be related to the enjoyment .
old person do enjoy their life by their own way a way which would never leads to no dilemma occur in their life .
Each step of the old person in the life would be an well calculated , well organized one

Lastly , `` old is better than gold '' and realy for me the gold is an ejoyment in the sense that money value of the gold , for me money is the main source of enjoyment and old is better then gold then way not the oldperson can enjoy more life then the young youths do .

596,104966.txt,P1,ZHO,high,"I agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
Having more knowledge could broaden ones horizon ; serve as a parth to discover ones true passion ; gain help with talking to other people and be capable of understanding the world around us .

Firstly , having more knowing of many academic subject areas could broden our horizons because we know different subjects in different fields .
Each specific subject has its own uniquness , therefore it would be better to know a bit about each areas .

Secondly , understanding more knowledge could serve as a path for people to discover their ` real ' passion .
Sometimes if we are always ` inside the box ' , it would be hard for us to find other hobbies and have the oppurtunity to think whether it was truly their passion or not .
When I was in Grade 11 , I studied courses in different areas , such as Chemistry , Accounting , Physical Education , Business , History etc .
I wans't sure of what I wanted to study in university , and I do n't want to limit my area of study , therefore I decided to broaden my knowledg by taking many acdemic subjects .
However my friend , whom desperately wanted to become a doctor , took all science courses , because she had discovered her passion .
As a result , I think it would be better to have a broad knowledge of many subjects before specializing one , unless you have found something that you really love doing .

Moreover , by understanding more subjects , it would be easier for people to engage in conversations with new people .
Everyone have different backgrounds , therefore if you have knowledge from different areas , it could be easier to socialize with people whom have different fields than you do .
A way of knowing more subjects is to read every section of the newspaper such as Businss , World , Entertainment etc .
This could help one to know more knowledge and therefore be more talkative when meeting new people .

Since the world changes everyday , everyday something new will happen .
If we do n't have the basic background towards a certain subject , we will not be able to understand it .
Moreover , a lot of subjects are inter-related , therefore you will need knowledge from other areas in order to fully understand the material .
For example , business ties with politics , political changes could affect the business environment , therefore it is essential for us to have a simple background of politics in order to understand business changes around the world .

In conclusion , with all the reasons stated above , I believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many acadmic subjects than to specialize in one specific subjects .

3407,589902.txt,P4,FRA,high,"Advertisments are a major part in the process of selling a product .
When you ask people about what they think of telling the truth in any situation , usually , their reserve is about business and selling in particular .
They will tell you that what we call a white lie can be an advantageous procedure in order to convince more easily to buy and that if the seller was honest , they may not want the product .
In this essay , we will discuss this point in order to demonstrate the agreement to the statement .

First , we can envisage the fact of someone who bought a product , trusting a really encouraging advertisment .
After trying it , the deception is huge .
She realizes that what the advertisment was saying is totally untrue .
It happens all the time .
The thing is that now , all these entreprises propose the solution of taking the product back to the shop .
In this case , they lose money , so this is a big risk to envisage for the people who want to sell the product in a large number and gain money .
Perhaps they lose more money lying about the product because of the large number of people who could show deception .

However , most of the time , this situation of an advertisment making products looking much better than they really are helps the business and push people to try and be excited about something .

First , it helps selling the product because it does not envisage the disavantages of this one .
People just see the good points and do not envisage living without this fantastic element .

It also helps the research because people , bying this product , will test it and eventually , when they are happy or not , call and make comments about it .
It is always good to know that in order to move on and to do progress .
It is always good to hear the users .

In conclusion , this is true that advertisment almost always act this way and lie about there product .
It is a part of their job to convince and that is something that cannot happen if the advertisment envisage all the problems that the product can show .
In the business world , they need this `` making much better '' to success .

1264,208687.txt,P7,DEU,high,"If I was asked some details on the exam , I wrote last week , I probably could n't remember a lot , although I spend quite an amount of time on preparation .
Is n't that a hint for the necessarity of changing learning requirements and student education - In my opinion , the teaching of basic qualifications concerning the achievement and comprehension of knowledge and thinking is the more effective way to a fluent , highly adaptable intellectual ability .
Being able to understand ideas and concepts is a capability which is required in nearly any kind of intellectual situation .
To be capable of the most important tools in dealing with academic material which maybe catching the main idea of a text , summarizing basic points , understanding the intention of an author or speaker , etc. is the basis for any kind of apprenticeship .
Unfortunately , this qualifications play a subordinate role compared to the learning of facts .

Of course , facts are also of importance to be able to treat a certain topic , but without the ability to integrate single facts into one 's fluent knowledge , they wo n't last in mind for long time .

Being able to use the basic tools for dealing with any kind of knowledge presented will strongly improve the ability to find out important facts if needed .
Like one of my teachers told me `` you do n't need to keep any fact in mind , but you need to know where to find it if necessary '' , it is important to konow about sources and connections between them - which means their basic ideas - while dealing with any context of apprenticeship .

As described above , I think , students should get familiar to understanding ideas and concepts , and even to develope their own ones , because this will allow them to deal with unknown information und contexts .
As especially at an early age , the human brain is able to develope , it is very important to implement basic competencies of learning and thinking at that time .

There are severals reasons to support my belief .

Firstly , specializing on only one specific subject would make a person becomes abstract .
Concentrating in training students one specific subject may have harmful effect in children 's development .
If children received specialized training in their studying , it may be too early for them to decide what to learn for their future .
A student may choose to study biology in Grade 7 , for example , because he likes animals .
When he grows up , he may find that the subejct is completely differernt from what he expects and it will be too late for him to swap to another subject .

Career prospects is the second issue that I consider .
Though having deep knowledge in one specific subject would let people become expertise , the society only requires a small portion of such kinds of experts , where college professors are the examples .
Instead , having variety of academic knowledge provides people diverse potential job position to select .
For example , a person who studies history may only able to work in a museum .
However , if the person also has other knowledge , say marketing , accounting or teaching , the person has much choices for what he or she can do from a marketing officers to school teaching .

Furthermore , multi-dimensional development should be encouraged instead of being expertise .
People having knowledge on diverse subjects would have a great difference from those only received specialized knowledge .
Having broad knowledge of different academic subjects would let a person make friends from various culture .
She could share her experience with her friends not only in physics or chemistry , but also from geography to sociology , which let her not to be isolated in a small area of interest .

Therefore , I would think that instead of having specialized in one subject , board knowlege in

Those facts probbably came from good concepts and ideas that helped you to make those facts .
It ' very important to students to understand ideas and concepts , this will give them a good base for their lives .
Are our roots since the human started to think .

For example , is like when you go to College or university , first , you have to learn how mathematics works , design , engineering and other classes in order to learn how to make a car .
If you just listen to your teacher about how they built a car or how companies built their cars , you will have an small idea how that works , but it wont be as helpfull as understanding ideas will be .
A basic example might be : You do n't write an article unless you now how to write .

When you learn from facts you are learning from an external source and experience , and each person is different , moment are different , you do n't know what is behind that fact .
It could be totally unlikelly from what you have learned .
For example , cars again , europeans started building cars for their own geography and characteristics , they were totally different from the ones built in Asia , because they are in differents places .

There is a process in life , humans learn ideas and concepts , we cannot say that we do n't learn from facts , but whe need someone to teach us how the thinks works , which tools should we use , methods , organization , etc .
After that , we will start to see different facts , but with some information in our brains .

It is much eassier for a student understand ideas and concepts that learn from facts .
That is why we belive in education , that is why education is so important in this world , and continues growing every day .

But I have to say that , if I were faced with the direction , I would probably follow most advertesements make products seem much better than they really are .
First reason refers to profit .
Only you show your product is very nice , the people will by it .
but problem is their product not really so nice .
so they use advertisements to expend their merits of products .
Secondly , no consequence and law to control their behavir .
In the following disscusion , I would like to reason and provide evidence to support my viewpoint .

No issue is more important than now the one that refers to profit .
History witnesses and presents many examples .
Such as some products of company lead the people dieth or disable ; or some hair condition include the toxins ; or some toy hurt the children .
But alll this product in the advertisements is the best product compare the sample kind of products in the wold .
the people do not know the truth , and buy it .
This way can make a huge number of profit for the companies , so they like to do that .
Do you think these examples are very persuasive ?

Another reason is head and chief that I have chosen to put here .
It is no better illustration can demonstrate the view .
For instance , the people know some advertsements is not true .
But they also are not so much fake , too .
So the people can not use the law or some rule to control their actions .
This case is exist in the most of advertisements .
If you can see that , you can understant it more deeply .
So the most striking conclusion is obovious .

To sum up , givern the reasons discussed above , we can arrive the conclusion that most advertesements make products seem much better than they really are .

9157,1459164.txt,P5,FRA,high,"Will the number of cars in use be lower in twenty years from now ?

I believe the answer is probably no .
What element could support the theory in question ?
Maybe the decrease in natural resources available to produce oil and finally feed our cars .
In fact this problem is already being assessed by car manufacturers and oil makers and we can say based on real examples such as Brasil that Colza based oil can effectively replace standard petrol products .
Electricity or hydrogen engines can also be an answer to oil unavailability .

The second argument , linked with the first one , is the consciousness of our civilizations regarding car impact on pollution and environment .
This is a good point , but we can see this feeling growing today only in countries were almost all the active part of the population has one or more cars .
And these civilizations are also the ones having less demographic expansion .
In other parts of the world like Africa , India or China there are still a lot of people dreaming about having a car , the rapid growth of their population will have a huge impact on car annual sales .

In my opinion another element which could be also utilized is the development of alternative ways of tranportation .
I belive this can be true in big cities were traffic jams and pollution are not good advocates for cars .
But we can oppose the fact that it 's being the case for the last 10 years and the decrease in numbers of cars never happened .

Also in more rural regions , any public transportation system will be efficient enough to replace the cars .
And the feeling of individual liberty that the car brings will not be found while sitting in an overcrowded bus which stops only in pre-designated spots .

And to finish , the special link - almost human - between some men and their cars , the car being the external image of their supposed success , is not a sign tha indicates a potential decrease in the numbers of cars in the next 20 years ...

What differentiates humanbeing from other living creatures is his / her ability to think and behave accordingly .
Helping to each other is one of the most important properties of humanity in this respect .
However , young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
There exist three important reasons of this fact .
First reason is young people begin to have an isolated life .
Second is competition between people increased and the last one is the fact that no one appreciates helping .

Young people begin to have an isolated life since life conditions force them to do so .
The daily requirements of the life such as going to work , earning money , taking care of children if exist , the obstacles arising from the technological development such as traffic jam , increased work load , the must to have a speedy life and the need to have a private time period for themselves make people to ignore other people and other people 's needs .
Young people , in which I am also included , just care their needs , their priorities , their lifes and themselves because existing life conditions do not allow them to spend time for others .

The second reason why young people do not give enough time to helping their communities is the increased competition between individuals .
Since it is now more difficult to enter in the college you really want , or to get the job you desire , or just to get promotion , young people keep all their knowledge , abilities and skills in themselves .
They do not share them with others and they do not help in terms of sharing information .

The last and the most important reason why young people do not help to their communities is the fact that no one appreciates them .
The main aim of people is nowadays just to make use of other people , not to share something .
If you help someone , he/she does not thank to you or does not get a reason to help to you next time you need .
That is why , people think that there is no need to help others if they will not appreciate .

In conclusion , may be it seems selfish not to spend enough time to help other people ; however , as mentioned above life conditions and attributes of other people force young people to do so ..

3867,670187.txt,P8,DEU,high,"From my point of view this statement is only partially true .
Through my studies in the area of management and entrepreneureship I know that the typical successful entrepreneur is not the crazy person many people think .
Quite the opposite is actually the case .
A successful entrepreneur thinks his ideas and plans through very carefully before acting .
Even though it is of course true that there is always some risk involved , risk-taking should not be confused with carelessness .
More over , I believe that a person who really knows where his or her strength lay , can be very successful .
For example , if a person has a passion for and the ability to building guitars , it will probably be best to exploid and build on this ability , rather than try to build many different instruments .
Specialization is the kye here .
So , if someone is good at something and likes what he or she is doing , improving the skills in this area will be more successful that starting to experiment .

This of course does not mean that a person , who focuses one his strengths , can stop learning .
It only means that the energy for learning new ways and methods should be focused on that one particular area .
For the guitar builder , for example , this would mean to every now and then try something new to improve his procedures .
He could maybe invent a machine which helps him to be more efficient .
Thereby he would be would try something new but the risk involved if the machine does not work is limited .

Another way to try something new without carelessly taking risk is to transfer experience .
A person who has gained expertise in a particular area might find a new and different way to use this knowledge .
Using the same example , the guitar builder could for example begin a cooperation with a violine builder and exchange knowledge .
The processes involved are similar but neither of them would have to actually start building the other instrument but both could still profit from the experiences .

After all , I would rewrite the satement as follows : Successful people try new things but carefully estimate the risk involved .

1385,230570.txt,P4,JPN,low,"I do n't agree with the statemant .
I do n't believe most advertisements make products better .
One example of advertisemants is to happen in my couontry , Japan .
There is a pretty popular company of vinegaer .
The vinegaer 's color is black .
It is said that it is better than normal one .
Actually , it is better , but the company said that black one contained many times nutirition .
It was wrong .
I ca n't believe avdvertisements .

Another example is when I was in Japan .
I sometimes brought something on the Internet .
I ca n't remember what I bought , but I just remember it that it was terrible .
I decided to buy something when I saw a advertisement on the Internet .
It was said that we sold the product with the lowest price in Japan .
But , one of my friend already had same product , and he bought in Tokyo with lower price than mine .
I do n't believe advertisement since that .

Last example , in Japan , we bought by advertisement , we could n't get better product that on advertisement .
Avdvertisements just show that how product is better .
So , actually advertisements are not better than real product .
I never believe it .

5296,921159.txt,P2,TUR,high,"Is the enthusiasm of a person decrease proportional to time ?
It is certain that this assertion depends on the personality or situation of the considered person .
However , the people lose their hopes from life as they get old and live an ordinary and boring life .
Therefore , I agree that life is more enjoyable for the youngs rather than olds since I believe in that the enthusiasm inside a person goes far away as days passed .

First of all , it is probably true for most of the people living on the earth , the experince of a young person is less compared to an old person .
Think that , when you get a question , you will immediately want to learn the answer of this question .
On the other hand , if you heard this question before , you would not get excited to hear the answer of the question .
Thus , I claim that the life is composed of lots of questions which all of them have answers aroun the world .
In fact , experience means that you learn the answers of most of these questions .
Thus , this question lost its significance for your aspect .
Besides , a younger person will have lots of questions related to life in many different areas .
It is certain that not all of the questions will draw the attention but the attractive ones will lead to discovering the enjoyability of the life .

On a different aspect , enjoying life risks your life in most of the activities and these activities require a definite energy level .
It can not be denied that as the person gets older , the metabolism of the body decreases in a continuous manner .
Let 's consider the bungee jumping , it is very enjoyable , but not suitable for the olds since it may not be suitable for their health .
In fact , the body , itself , does not let the person do some enjoyable activities .
Thus , sometimes it may not be related to lose of enthusaism due to age of person .
It limits the activities that can be done .
Moreover , as a person leaves out doing this type of exciting things , it results in a continuous cycle that leads to an ordinary life .

To sum up , I think that enthusiasm makes life more enjoyable .
Besides , sometimes due to some limitations such as health , the people may not perform exciting activities .
Moreover , when the people learned the answers of the questions that are interesting for them , they do not take part in enjoyment of the life .
Although it may not be possible due to limitations of the life , the person should enjoy life .

4604,802609.txt,P4,TUR,medium,"I have to admit that this statement is really true in these set of material nowadays .
advertisements plays really big role markets .
all selling plans setting according to advertiesements .
in advertiesement they can show product better in many ways .

first of all they show product with it 's most beatifull look .
they play the image with computer because nowadays the tecnologies are really developed to do these kinds of arrangements so they use it .
and also they show the product very practical even it is not .
they shows you use of the product as easy as a toy and when you see them you believe that and so you buy it but the fact that sometimes you ca n't even combine the part of the product or if this product is a food they eat it like they never eat anyhing like it before so you wanna taste that but again the fact not changes and you will be disappointed in the end .

secondly they make some word tricks and play with the words even they can mislead you about that product or that product 's apportunities .
also you only see the good parts of product in the advertisement .
the bad parts never mentioned and limitation or some bad ways about product always shown at the bottom with really thiny letters .
so you never read that thiny letters but by the time you are being misleading about apportunities or sales etc .

the last and most important mind game is the slogan of the product , the selling sentences or word or word groups which related with the product .
if they make a good jingle or song or warning in advertisement it stuck on your mind because you listen that on and on and on .
so you remember that all the time so when you see product you remember advertisement and you wanna try it .

as a conclusion advertisement affects all the selling of the product and we know that not all the products are good and on to that if we still trying these products it 's all because of these advertisements .
on the other hand the products not always bad as I mentioned but no matter what the advertisements always shows it better than itself .

7221,1135240.txt,P1,HIN,high,"Ours is a fast developing society and and we have varied branches of study in which we can gain specialization .
The question whether it is better to have a knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one subject is a very debatable one and the responses may vary from individual to individual .
here , let us anlyze the situation ..

Universities to day offer many subjects in which students can choose to major such as the sciences , math , literature and arts ...
each of these subjects also have many applied branches .
Take for instance science which comprises of medical sciences , physical sciences , astronomy and so on ...
the scope of learning today is so vast that one cannot hope to master completely even one subject , so the view of learning may subjects seems to be completely out of question ...
Therefore , I strongly support the view that students should specialize in one specific subject rather that learning a lot of subjects .
My arguments for the same go as following .

As it is said that `` THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION SHOULD HAVE A DIRECT BEARING ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE '' , true as it is .
If a student focuses his energy and time on learning one subject he she can gain better expertise and thus he will be more proficient in that subject .
A proficiency in any field in turn bring with it better work opportunities and a better quality of life .
on the other hand if a student has sveral subjects to study and he cannot devite his time to one , he will probably end up being aimless and jobless too .

Here some people might counter my view by saying that .
if a person has knowledge about varied subjects he will be in a better situation to face the challenges of life .
yes , that is one fact that is undeniable but as far as professional educatipn is concerned i strongy support the idea of majoring in one subject only .

We all have plans for the future and we know what we want to be in the future , We are aware of our abilities and interests so after calculating on all these factors one should choose a field that he wants to specialize in instead of trying to learn all subjects because it is virtually impossible for mortals to retain all that they learn in school or university .
So if i want to be a computer engineer why should i be bothered about learning about the various forms of music .
The answer is obvious - it will be of no practical use to me .

In view of the facts that i mentioned above we can safely reachthe conclusion that one should focus on specializing in one field only rather than creating an anarchic situation in your mind by trying to gain expertise in various subjects .

7648,1172909.txt,P4,JPN,medium,"For as long as this sophisticated society has existed , people have debated which advertisements effectively work to attract consumers .
Although this issue may never resolved to everyone 's satisfaction , the matter is very clear in my mind : I disagree with this statement .
Many advertisements do not make products seem much better than they really are .

That not all advertisements success to attract consumers is evident for several reasons .
To begin with , some advertisements discourage people to purchase the products .
To illustrate , in many countries , the advertisements of tobbacos have warming sentences on them .
When I traveled in Australia , I detected that even the photos of lung cancers were used in the advertisements .
In this case , the advertisements warn us the possibility of danger that is caused by using the products .
Indeed , the advertisements of tobbacos do not makes products better .

Furthermore , some advertisements utilize an unique strategy to attract consumers .
For example , Yukiguni-maitake , Japanese food products company , uses the conspicuous strategy : Its advertisement says that do not buy its products .
This advertisement is unusual , therefore , many consumers are attracted and finally buy the products .
In view of this , the advertisements sometimes apply unique strategy which does not appeal merits of the products .

Nevertheless , some critics claims that the advertisements ' role is to appeal the products .
However , the fact , as detailed above , reveals that some advertisements try to prevent customers from buying their products .

In conclusion , I believe that the advertisements usually use different strategies to attract customers .
It is clear from my examples .

5743,1003939.txt,P8,SPA,high,"I totally agree with the statement because I consider if people did n't take their chances and take risks trying to gain something else in reward the world would not be the one we know today .

If hundreds of years ago a crazy guy would n't have taken the risk and tried finding a different route to get by ship to India we would probably still be living in trees and hunting animals to obtain food and the rest of the world would still believe the Earth is n't round .
Or if the Wright Brothers would n't have risked their lives as well as their pride trying to invent a revolutionary way of transportation based on birds it would still take for us weeks or even months to travel from America to Europe .
That 's why I think people should always be willing to take their chances and not be afraid to risk something that in the end might bring an enormous bennefit not only to them but to others as well .

We have always feared what we do n't know and that 's why normally we try only doing what we know to do well , but in my opinion we are the only creature on Earth with the ability to learn something new every day and evolve thanks to those knowledges .
If we have that possibility we might as well try to gain something from using it , or else there would be no difference between a person and an animal .

I also consider that a peson that does n't do anything new in his life and always try to do the same things will end up by not liking what he does .
And even though that person might be successful in life doing what he does it wo n't matter because in the end he wo n't be a happy person which is , in my personal consideration , even more important that success .

In conlcusion I agree with the fact that it 's necessary for us to take risks , we even take them every day when we get up , but it 's only a matter of luck to gain something in return if we not only risk something but also try our best while doing any activity .

2952,511900.txt,P1,ITA,medium,"With reference to these different solution , I think that both the possibilities have got advantages and disadvantages .
In my opinion , if it is better to have broad knowledge or to specialize in one specific subject depends on several factors such as the country where do you have to work and which kind of job you are interested to .

Indeed each country has got its own traditions and political system that surely influence the academic choice of a person .
In my country , it is more common to have a broad knowledge of many subjects so people could have a wider choice between many jobs .
It is also very important which job you would like to do in the future .
Indeed scientifical jobs need specialized knowledge of a subject such as chemistry or math .
On the other hand there are several jobs which need a broad knowledge of many subjects .
For example a person who wants to teach licterature have to study grammar , poetry , history , and so on .

Although specialize in one specific subject has got its positive factors , such as the possibility to find early a good job , I surely prefer to have a broad knowledge for several reasons .

First of all , I would like to know a lot about our world , and if I studied a specific subject I would know only a topic .
Secondly by having broad knowledge you will be able to choose between different jobs .
After all you can specialize yourself after that you have found a good job .
So I generally do agree with the statement

11166,1830175.txt,P8,KOR,medium,"I agree to the statement .
If you think , speak , and behave like any other people or in the routinal way you are used to , then how could you make changes and reach the top ?

Of course , being successful means different to everyone .
For me , being successful means being one of the top , without regard to the field or area you are in .
A successful businessman is one of the most influential leaders in the field of managing and administrating an enterprise .
A successful pianist is one of the most revered musicians and plays the piano more accurately , at the same time gracefully , than others .

For instance , Hee-ya , a 19-year-old girl with only four fingers , is now a successful pianist in Korea .
Her performance may not be as good as Mozart ; but the thing is , despite the harsh circumstance , she became one of the prospective pianists in Korea .
She would not have gained the fame and recognition , had she given up and blamed the situation .

The potential to succeed is not born with ; it 's all about grabbing as many opportunities as one can and doing things that usual people do not even think about .

1860,320613.txt,P4,TUR,medium,"I think the products we see on TV ads , newspapers , magazines and billboards are usually exegerrated , but this is the point of an advertisment , to make us believe that we really need that product or that product will solve all of our problems about whatever that product is for .
This is basically the heart of the capitalism .

One of the examples of overrated products is the fitness tools , which promise the consumers to have bigger muscles or to lose weight .
These ads want us to desire to be like the people we see on these ads and then they convince us that we can be exactly like them if we buy their product , as if that product magically transform us into the person we want to be .
The trick they usually use is to show photos of people before and after they used their product but these photos are often fake ones .

Another example for the misleadind advertisements can be the ads that try to convince consumers that their product will change our lives in many ways .
This time the trick they use is putting a lot of meaning to one item like that product defines who we are , who our friends are , etc .

As a conclusion , advertisements and are used for two purposes by companies , to make us desperately desire their products and to cover a really bad product .

10014,1625843.txt,P2,TEL,medium,"I dont agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than the older people .
The given statement can be accepted only to the extent of physical strength .
The older people can not do all aspects of work physicaly as actively as young people can do .
But in other aspects they can be on par with people .
Before saying how let me categorise different types of enjoying life .
It could be in terms of spirituality , philanthropy , through experience which comes along with age , perception of life etc .
An older person can how to relieve from stress compare to an younger person which leads to hapiness or unhapiness in life .
Well i believe that an individual can enjoy his life only when he has peace .
An older person can better deal the traumatic stiuations that every one faces in life than a younger person .
The younger person enjoys his life mostly through matrliastic pursuit which is only temporary and not the real joy .
But at the most an older person who swam accross the age of youth is more inclined towards spiritual bliss .

He is more religious and he can see the path between him and the god and that is the real and true joy .
What is so sick about among people is that they dont have time to enjoy different aspects of life like nature , literature and arts in their busy schedule of life of accademics and carrier .
An yong person may not experience the same quality of joy as an older person can while jogging or listening to music or showing concern and understanding people come to them .
What iIwant to conclude is that the definitio for enjoyment may not be same for all .
each individual can enjoy life according to the way he perceive it .
So i dont agree that young people enjoy life more than older people .

4519,785621.txt,P4,HIN,high,"I would agree on the point that most products advertised are not as good as they are portrayed in the advertisements .
The reason for my belief is that the advertising companies get a lot of money from the manufacturers to make their ad look better .
And due to this the make the product look very flash and attractive in the advertisements even if it is the most hideous product .

Advertisement is the best marketting stratergy that decides the sale of the products and the companies success .
In order to ahieve certain targets and to attract more customers the companies advertise their items in a manner that makes them more desirable to the viewers .
To do this they add certain features which the might not be able to provide .
They spend a lot of money on these ads .

For example , a cell phone company X adverstises its phone that has all the features except a very bright coloured handset that might attract people .
So the advertisers usually enhance the colour of the handset in the adds that people like to see .
They modify the product with the help of the computer techniques .
This might be misleading for the viewers of the ad if they order the handset just because of its colour .
Most people believe in what the see in the advertisements and order the products on the basis of the ads .
This can lead to viewers forming a wrong opinions about the products too .

Giving a personal example , i ordered an entertainment book which according to the advertisement had all the addresses of the tourist places in and around newyork but when i finally got the book in hand i discovered that the book had only a few selected place and it did not include all the important tourism spots for eg. the museum of modern arts or the radio city hall in manhattan .
How could any book miss that ?

On the basis of the reasons and examples citied above and on the basis of my experience I would finally conclude that the advertisemnets are often misleading and do not provide the exact information and the viewers should go into the details of the product before buying them .

so their patrent decided to study abroad .

8331,1299928.txt,P8,SPA,medium,"I agree with this statement that said `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they alreary know how to do well . ''
The reason because I agree with this statement is this .
If successful people only do whatever they know very well , we will have around the world the same things .
For example , cars , if the people who are encharge to biuld new models of cars , and they do not try to do something new , how boring , we do not have a lot of options , but because they take risks we have a numerous options when we are looking for a car , you , me , everybody can buy all kind such as : a BMW , a Jaguard , a Camry , a Jeep , etc .
As well people who want to start a new restaurant , the want to oppend something new .
If in the area where they are going to biuld this new restaurant are some Chiness , Greek , or Text Mexican food , but they do not have a real Mexican Food , I think that the best thing they can do is started a restauran that it is not in this area .
Another example is Fashion , women love fashion , they do not use the same clouth , they changed almost the 365 days during the years .
The new disainers are fightting each other in order to have the best disign , they are risking , but if he or she disign is the best , they will get a good income .
If you do not risk , I almost sure , you wo n't win .
Take a risk and you will be successful in life .
In life we need to risk most of the time .
You make risk when you want to change to another job because you can get better salary , but who knows that you will be there for a long time , or when you move to another city , it is risky but do not be afraid , you will be fine , the only thing you need is trust in yourself .

5244,911578.txt,P1,FRA,high,"Opting for general academic knowledge instead of a more specific one is a defining choice .
It will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the student 's future professional career .
While broad knowledge is often prefered , I personally think that focusing on specific topics is more relevant .
Indeed , I am convinced that it is essential in order to become competent in a field .
Moreover , a freshly graduate student with very specific skills is more likely to match an employer expectations .
Nevertheless , in the particular case of management , broader knowledge is still preferable .

First and foremost , going deep into a subject allows students to master perfectly a field , while surfacing it results in the end in useless skills .
By tackling everything , we finally stop working on a subject when it is getting interesting .
For instance , in high school , we discover many things : just enough to have a vague understanding of how things work .
I would have loved to go further on biology , physics ...
But we lacked time .
In order to go further on a subject , making a choice is needed .

Then , I think that a student who is specialized will better fit a company needs than if he had general background academic knowledge .
Indeed , in the modern industry , what is needed is very focused people , working on tiny tasks .
The gathering of those tiny tasks , with each of them perfectly performed , makes the final result great .
For instance , a friend of mine was specialized in micro frequence wave lengths , or close .
He had no difficulty to be hired for a top level position in a military company because his profile was very rare .

Finally , I would underline the fact that there is one field where broad competences are better : management .
As a matter of fact , what a manager is asked for is not doing things well .
He is expected to be able to make his team deliver a great job .
So he should understand the tasks of each of his teammates in order to manage them properly .
The higher his position , the broader his skills .
For instance it would be a non sense to ask a CEO in a pharmaceutical company to having very deep knowledge of drugs composition .

To conclude , I would say that having a specific approach is a winning solution for any student .
Then , if he is to reach managerial positions , he will have the opportunity to get an MBA in order to learn broader things for instance .

| More competent : surfacing topics vs having an in6deep knozledge .
Zith broad learnings : stop zhen it starts getting interesting .

Specialized : today co ; panies , research specific knowledge for efficiency

So it is certain that the demand of car also increases with the increase of the population .

Young people have different type of thinkings and always the mind of young people is wandering all over the world whereas the olderpeople does n't think more because as they think of their life , family and children Firstly , younger people have different types of ideas and thinkings in mind they always want to be cheerful , they enjoy alife lot and they does n't think much about family .
There will be no limitations for the younger people and they achieve every thing always they want to be whereas older people will have limitations .
For example if a young person want to do a stunt he will recklessly do it he does n't think about the next situation what is going to be happened whereas old person will think of it to do stunt and some times he will egt apanic to do it .
Young people will have a lot dreams which can be achievable wheres the dreams of older people cannot be achievable sometimes .

Secomdly Young people will enjoy a life lot with no limitations in the world and behaves like a freebird whereas older people ca n't behave like that due to their age and health problems .

For example young person wants to dance and he will do it with out any hesitation wheras older people wo n't dance as that of young people dueto their age and thinking of their health .
Even in Food point of view also younger people can eat each and every thing but older peoeple ca n't Young people have a lot of dreams and can fulfil their dreams but old people ca n't fulfil their dreams at sometime .

11194,1833503.txt,P8,SPA,high,"Recently , I recieved an anonymous , yet very impressive , e-mail power point presentation that made me reflect and musitate on various philosophies of life .
On of these specifically captured my attention : `` To achieve something you have n't met with before , you must do something , well , that you have n't done before . ''
Certainly , successful people do capture fame because they have ventured out into a sea of opportunities rather than stay safely in a boat .

Literature has supported the idea that success arrives after an original challenge has been overcome .
In the epic of Gilgamesh , the hero directs himself to try to gain immortality by traveling to the end of the world .
Though he misplaces the final flower of youth , Gilgamesh acknowledges a sudden sense of completion in his being and a spark of energy to change his kingdom .
Gilgamesh 's goal of gaining immortality does complete itself , as is stated at the end of the epic poem , when his name is recorded in history and remembered throughout subsequent generations .

However , the greatest examples of succes involving risk come to us in history .
Several names pop into my head : Ghandi , Mother Teresa , Martin Luther King , Jr. , Betty Williams , Nelson Mandella ...
All of these people participated and led heroic acts against the standards and conventions of society , against the expectancy of the crowd , and gave us , the present day generations , life , liberty , and justice .
If this fails to ring up the word `` success '' in my ear , I do not know what will .

Finally , personal experiences have rendered this belief of the correlation between risk and succes true .
Two years ago , I decided to try out for my school 's soccer team .
I played midfield , but I settled for goalie just because the team needed one .
This position actually scared me , but , nevertheless , I kept practicing to develop my latent abilties .
Incredibly , I became an all-star goalie .
Even today , I have been invited to compete in the Junior Olympics as a keeper .

All in all , success usually involves some type of risk .
Progress , innovations , and fame all resulted from wild attempts to change .
in this case , `` change '' is the key word .
A transformation from safe to highly challenging equals a tranformation from loser to victorious .

2813,487121.txt,P3,KOR,low,"It may looks like it to many people , but I disagee with this .
I think in old days , things that should be done had been visible .
It was need to be done with physicall labor .
Now , physical labor is less needed by using machines and computers .
Young people nowadays just do n't have idea what is really needed .

Where their hearts are , where their treasure is .

Old days , Society was composed by big families .
Everybody is helping everybody .
You know who you are helping , because they are their family members , relatives , or everyday neighbors who is even more close to your real relatives .

But in modren socity with nuclear families people do n't know really about their neighbors .
In this situation , getting help from other people sometimes considered as personal shame for some of us .
As society is more and more materialized .
We tend to judge other people by what they have , rather than what he/she really is .

We should teach our young people about real values .
We should open our eyes on emotional and spritual world .
So that their values are not to have something more for them selves , but for others .

Let ' them have chance .

2463,427362.txt,P3,HIN,medium,"No community can exist if the young do not take an active part in its development .
Saying that young people do not give time to help their communities would be wrong .
The fact that the young generation enjoys the life and lives it up has created a wrong impression that they are not serious about their communities .
But if we look carefully then we 'll realise the role the youngsters are playing in the development of their communities .

I remember when i was in school , we were made to go to the slum areas and help the children over there to learn to read and write .
Camps were organised by students to educate the locals of a village on the importance of education .
All these initiatives were taken by the students who form the bloodline of any community .

Another example that I can recollect of the youngster 's role in a community is when I went for a vacation to a small town by the sea .
The authorities had allowed breaking of a ship that contained asbestos which is harmful to humans .
It was the effort of the young people of the community that that ship was made to return and a community was saved .

Therefore , the youngsters do care about their communities and play an important role in defining how a community should be rather than just being a part of it and accepting it the way it was given to them .

10250,1667118.txt,P3,SPA,high,"I firmly belive that , nowadays , young people do a lot to help their communities .
I am afraid that the amount of help that young people provide is not enough , but after all , how can you say how much help is enough ?

First of all , in modern times young people have the oppoourtunity to help their communities while they do military service .
It is true that this help might be obligatory , but it is help , nevertheless .
Military service has evolved all around the world , and in several countries , quite radically .
For example , in my home country ( Mexico ) young people have the option to either enroll in the military or do their service for social causes .
More than half the young people prefer to teach to the poor or build houses for the needed than marching and shooting fire guns .
This same trend is currently spreading in all Latin America .

Second , nowadays there are a lot more oportunities to help than in earlier times .
There a numerous benefitial institutions recruiting young people .
I had the opportunity to do voluntary work for UNICEF , and I was surprised with the amount of young people working there for free .
I was even more surprised when I found out that they were overstaffed , and that this overstaff was often sent to brand new goodwill institutions .
Another example happened just two weeks ago , in Germany .
A bunch of shool kids engaged in several events in order to earn money .
All of the money was given to poor childer in Africa .
The motto of the action was `` Kids helping Kids '' .
This innovative project was very popular , and it is being copied all around the country .
I am sure that it will not take long for it to spread in all Europe .

A third and final proof is Rock Concerts .
If you watch MTV , you would realize that there are several Rock Concert events that donate their profits for good causes .
One of them took place just a few years ago , in London .
I do n't remember the exact amount that they got toghether , but I do rememebr that it was in the millions of dollars .
All of the artitst performed for free , and all of the profits were donated to the poorest countries in Africa .
The event also made political pressure on rich countries , in order to make them forgive the national debt of the poorest african nations .

For these reasons , I think young people do a lot to help , not only their communities , but the whole world .
On the other hand , I do not belive that this help is enough .
I belive that there is still a lot that can be done .

7890,1213421.txt,P7,HIN,high,"I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .

Learning is a process of memorizing a given context or material .
Thus is memorizing is usually a short - term , learning facts will be short term as well .
Understanding a given context , helps one to adopt to it a something natural to oneself and thus doesnt require memorizing .
Understanding a concept or an idea is long term .

In my school time , during the Mathematics class i was constantly told by my professors to understand a proof or to understand a theorem , say pythagoras theorem .
He specifically told us not to memorize them .
The emphasis he laid on understanding was because even today , 8 yrs after , i am asked about pythagoras theorem , i dont have to struggle to remember it .
As i understood the theorm and didnt memorize it , it became natural to me and was embedded in my conscious and thus even today i can recall what pythagoras theorem relates to .

Another generic example that i can state is that India is cuturally diverse .
Thus people follow many different cutlures .
Its often difficult for children to learn why they should follow certain pratices that their religion demands .
For example an Hindu child would question his mother upon learning that his Cathlic friend visits the chruch every sunday morning while he doesnt .

The elders would then explain to him the reason or a concept behind the inception of a particular religious procedure which helps the child to understand his religion better and ceases the doubts that arise out of learning of a religious procedure .
The understanding of culture differences not only would help the child appreciate this own culture but of others as well .

Thus understanding of ideas and concepts help in clearing out of doubts and foster better and effective learning .

Surely , if we travel with a tour gude , we can enjoy a trip even if we can not speal english well because if we have a problem , a tour guide will help us to solve the problem .
In addition , we can go to famous place in a good way .
It means that we can go many place without waste time .
At the same time , we will be able to get a lot of knowledges about the place which we go from a tour guide .
If we travel with tour guide , we will enjoy and we will be safe .

However , if we travel with a tour guide in a group , we have to mind time anytime .
If we have free time , we have to come back on time which a tour giude says .
If we want to look more , we can not do that if we travel with a tour guide .
If we have a place which we want to go , we can not go there if the place is not the place of course even if the place is very near the way of course .
If we travel by ourselves , we do n't need mind time .
we can stay the place as we want .
Furthermore , we can make a plan the travel as we want .
Therefore , we do n't need got to the place which we are not interested in and we can go to the place only we are interested in .

3972,688464.txt,P2,DEU,high,"Some people may think that younger people enjoy their life more than old people , whereas other people might find the elder part of life more joyful .
Mainly because youth in our hedonistic society on the eve of capitalism is often seen as the ultimate good , most people may tend to agree with the first opinion .
On TV , in the newspapers the fun that young people have is shown .
Not just the so - called stars of Hollywood or elsewhere try to stay forever young , is it through fashion or the benefits of plastic surgery .

So after all , there must be something about it .
And , yes , it is definitely fun to be young .
Your body is healthy and maybe beatiful , you are free and everything is new and exiting , the book of life is not written yet , everything seems within your reach .

So youth is , frankly said , a wonderful thing .

But the problem is , that in a society where youth seems to be all , being old seems to be the odd counterpart .
Who wants to think about being old , not able to move properly , maybe dependend on medicine and not able to think in new ways ?

But in my opinion , their can be certain benefits in the later ages , too .
You maybe have a lovely wife or husband and a familie that gives you all the fulfilment you have dreamt of when you whre still young .
Whereas youth can be a big struggle in the dark , the age brings the advantage of experience with it .
Furthermore one can maybe afford nice things like big sports cars , houses in the provence or younger women young men just could dream of .

So after all I think that both ages could be great fun , it certainly depends on your personal situation and the personal ideas about every age .
According to this a pure culture of youth is doubtlessly a mislead in cultural development , especially regarding to the demographic changes that will turn us soon into a society of elder people .

When offering a product the best quality of it is shown .
this marketing technique has boost up a lot of product for not saying most of them .
We have some cases like shampoos , clothes , and medicines .

First , most of the adverstisments company only wants to sell , no matter how , no matter when , but the faster the better , sometimes they exagerate the functions of a product or its qualities , to convince and presuade people to buy it .

Second , the product will eventually work but most of the times not in the way shown in the adverstisment , lets take the case of a no-hair lost shampoo , the advertisment will show a bald man who wants his hair back , so he will use the shampoo for a few days and after minutes in the advertisment you will see a guy with long hair talking about his experience , i really do not beleive that , thats my personal opinion because they say you will se results in a short period , and yes , you will see them but not as much as they say it will .

Third , advertisments create sometimes a non-real idea of the products , or if they do they will show you real shallow .

In conclusion , advertisments only work for boosting up a product and convince a costumer .
It is not a main purpose show what the product really is or how is it going to work or how long does it will take .
They just want to convince you and persuade you to buy it .
Thats why i strongly dislike to see advertisments , everything is a big lie , my quote is `` advertisment products do half of what they say and half of what they pomise '' .

3893,674845.txt,P7,SPA,medium,"I think that is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts , because once they have clear in their minds the concepst about some article , called science , mat , phycology , any thing tha they are learning , it is posible to follow up with the learning procecess .
I completly agree , when i have idea of what my professror is talking about , when i comprhended the bases of any discoution , is the point to opened the door to the understatndin and after , i can memorize and learn the facts .

Many times students , include myself , are seeting in a class , where the professor is showing the facts , but seems like professor and student most forget that how can you have an example or talk about a fact with out understand the mean idea .

I am in a nursing class for example , if i do not understand the idea or concepts about the heart mechanisms , how the heart works , how the blood it is pump , thense i will never understant the fact tha a patient is having a heart attack due to high blood pressure .
It is really important for any student , of any profetion , for any area of life , to understand firts the ideas , the concepts , it is the ideas that shows up first in our brain , that make us think , is those thougths that motivated us to find the facts , i think the facts should follow a good understanding of the ideas , finally if a student is in a class with out undestend ideas , is better to ask questions , express themself about how they fell , and have some help with books , webs , or talking with the tacher , it is better understand than learn facts , once i understand , the rest is easy .

9342,1494458.txt,P2,JPN,high,"I agree with the statement that , young people enjoy life more that older people do .
There are 3 reasons why I agree with that opinion .
First of all , for young people most of the things they experience are new and they facinate young people .
Young people have curiosity and it motivates them to do things and try many things .
I believe that trying to do something is essential for my life and it is the best way to enjoy my life .
However elderly people know what is interesting and what is not , and they easily give up trying .

Secondly , young people often worry .
They worry about their future , love , relationship between their friends or family and so on .
While they are worrying about these things there are lots of talking , laughing and crying and that makes people grow up .
Young people often have more dificulties than elderly people do , and it is because taht young people have less knowledge .
But I do not think having less knowledge for life experience is bad thing .
It also can motivate people .
Usually , older peoople use their knowledge of their experience and avoid having difficulty and chose easier way .
It is not an interesting thing for me at all .

Third reason is concerned about physical problems .
When people get older , that is natural that you have more physical problems that you used to when you were young .
Physical and phycology effect each other , so when older people get physical pain , they might be nervouse and do not feel like doing anything .
Actually , my grand mother used to play golf untill about she was 55 , but since she got a pain on her knee , she stopped playing golf and the more , she stopped going outside .
I was very sad I saw her always sitting on a chair and watching TV .
But young people have much less physical problems so that we can try anything we want to .

Young people are hopefull and have lots of energy .
When you get older and reflect yourself for not to do anything you wanted to , is what I hate the most .
Challenging is the best thing to satisfy your life .

For those reasons I believe that young people can enjoy life more than older people do .
"
8807,1390765.txt,P2,KOR,medium,"By looking at the people around me and the society , I could see that young people tent to enjoy life more than older people do .
I think it is true that the young people enjoy their life than most older people do as the young people think more positively than older people do and as the young people try to do everything in enjoyable ways .

First of all , young people have positive minds that they try to accept things in good way even though they are not in a fondable situation .
But in contrast , old people worry first and afraid to put in actions before they start .
In my opinion , this is because the young people believe that they still have a lot of years to live so that they always try to carry out experimental things and try new things .
On the other hand , older people think that they do not have long lives left .
they always try to be care and think more before they carry out any things .
For example , when I and my father goes to a restaurant , we often choose different meals .
My father always choose the same menu that he had last time but I always choose different meals and sometimes try new ones if the restaurant invented one .
Like this , older people do not like change their normal routine and get out of tract when young people like to change and try new more .

Secondly , young people tend to enjoy life more than older people do as the young people take things easy and try to enjoy everything they do .
I think it is true that young people seek out for something that is interesting and fun while older people find everything seems to be same .
For example , I went to a market with my grandmother and when we got to there , my grandmother only went straight to the section where it has things that she has to buy .
However , when I entered , I walked around the most sections and saw things that are displayed and read notes on it .
Like this , young people find interesting facts for themselves even from boring things when the older people only look for what they want .

Overall , I agree on the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do as young people are always open-minded and make thing enjoyable for themselves in their ways .

204,35548.txt,P2,KOR,high,"Young people often wonder about their future , questioning if they will be happier when they get old .
In general , older people lives happier life than the young .
First point that I want to address is that the older people are more stable emotionally As people become mature as a human being , they would not be tempered as quickly as they used to be .
we discover that it is meaningness to be agressive .
For example , I hated everyone at school when I was in middleschool .
However , when I read To kill a mocking bird , a novel , I started to realize that it is wrong to hate someone with no reason Second , older people lives happier life by managing or overcomming their hardships easily .
There are times of desperation and sadness in our lives .
To prevail frustration is very important to avoid depression and anger , but young people usally does not have ability to do so .
Statistics conducted on 2006 showed that there were average thirty students for a day who committed sucide because of their academic pressure .
It is relatively bigger average rate than of adults , while it is not ture that students bare more stress than adults .

The last thing I have discovered is that older people appreciates things in their life more .
My grandmother knows how to appreciate small thing in her life such as sunshine , food , and house ; it seems that she gets happy every moment in her life .

In contrast , young people tend to be careless and negative .
They say `` Cool '' only when there is a really nice things .

In Conclusion , Older people tend to have happier lifes .
By mangaging frustration , emotional stability , and appreciation of life able them to be happy in every aspects of lives .

its hard question to answer because ther are some products are really better than it shows in the advertisments and the others are do n't .

I disagree about the food 's product because they do n't care by the people at all , the important think for them is how to collect the money from people , but no body asks him selfe this quistion Is that really this food healthy ? .
no body from them asks How many one will suffring if they use this product .

Let me be more spacific and talk about kind of food which is the humberger .
We watch alot of advertisements about it , in TV , newspaper , magazine , and we hear them in the Radio station , but I never heard from those people explanation if the product is healthy or not .
Is the product helping peopl have a bad colestrol or not .
In fact the humberger increase the bad colestrol , and it couse alot of heart problems such as the hart attack .
Unfortuanatly , the government dos n't care .
they care only for colecting money from them , but the people it dos n't matter if they will go to the hill .

In the same time I agree there are a products show in advertisements helping the people .
For example the products helping the Handecab people , or any kind of product give a real advice to the people such as , the medicin product , of course we will ask our doctors abut it .
Also I disagree about the product became an a dengerous .
For example the advertisements call people to jump from over the mountain , or eat some insects like Fear Factor program , I know there is a warning in the program , but the people do like them exactly , and they got hurts .

So we need to be honest with our advertisement and with people .

479,86347.txt,P1,TEL,high,"I strongly disagree with the notion that having a broad knowledge of many subjects is better than specializing in one .
I feel that in today 's world , where competition for jobs is increasing , one who specializes in a particular field is the one who stands out in the crowd of men and women who have a knowledge of many subjects .
Also , the person becomes passionate about the subject that he decides to specialize in and that gives him enormous satisfaction .
Great personalities testify the fact that specializing in one field always the better option .

Da Vinci , one of the most famous artists of all times was also an accomplished physicist .
Although he had no formal education in the field , he had a great wealth of knowledge about it .
However , this was detrimental to him in a way as he always used to think of his paintings in a scientific way rather than a purely artistic one .
So although he created masterpieces , he left many more projects unfinished as he felt that those projects were lacking in some detail scientifically .
For example , he thought that a painting should contain no element of ethreal fantasy and that it must obey the laws of physics .
In this way , his choice was limited and he did not access his full potential .
Had he been a little less rigid in his principles , we would have seen many more of his wonderful works .

Another example would be my uncle who switched his majors no less than four times while doing his undergraduation .
When he tried to get a good job in one of the fields he had studied , he found none .
To his dismay , he discovered that each of the jobs needed an extensive knowledge on the subject , a specialisation of some kind .
After the incident , he finally settled for medicine and went to graduate school .
He specialized in Nephrology and needless to say , is a successful surgeon now .

In conclusion I strongly feel that being a jack of all trades and master of none diffuses one 's talents and prevents one from reaching the highest potential .
An individual can carve a niche for himself in the world if he has his own identity , in this case , the one subject he takes up and specializes in .

3783,656961.txt,P8,TEL,medium,"I agree with the statement `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . ''

People always try new things in oneway or the other to make their life more affordable or happier .
When a person tries in developing something that would make life of society , he will succed in doing so because he have invested considerable amount of time and risk .
Once succeded , he looks for new things that are pausable for many people .
He takes this as a spirit or challenge .
He brainstrom ideas , put to experiment and take the risks .
It is a desire to try newthings with risk for the people who were successful in the past .
It makes them fell happier and drive forward .

I would give some personal examples to strongly support my above statement .
For instance , when I was working on reasearch project at a pharmaceutical company back in my early childhood , I developed a drug for cancer that helped cure many people .
I took the risk in developing the drug knowing the consequences that will have my life .
This successful incident led me to try new things .

Development of instrument that revolutionized the lives of people who have Diabetes ( people who cannot regulate bood sugar ) .
This happened when I was with Pfizer in early 1984 .
At times there is no way people can analyse their blood sugar level without going to hospitals .
It was really very hard on me to develop and instrument that would one day help everyone to get their blood glucose results instantaneously .
I had spent considerable amount of time on this project .
If I am right , it took me 10 years to develop this instrument .

I felt it is like taking the risk , because I may succed at the end or may be not .
I was very successful in doing so .

Finally , I would appreciate the people who are successful and try new things , eventhough knowing the risks in doing so .

I do have to be clear saying that facts are not as important as concepts and ideas are , but fatcs are not secundary thing without impotance they are really importat in any learning process .

I say this because I am student and I can now be sure that when a teacher begins explaining facts without a theory before that includes different concepts and ideas , the class is really a lack of time , because students maybe understand the facts but do not really learn the theory that it is behind of it .

Althouht it is also inconvinient for learning , when whe as students only recive concepts and ideas but no facts or examples that explains what the teacher is trying to explain , because in this way possibly we learn a teory but we wo n't be capables of ussing it .

A clear example of this matter it is when you try by yourself to read a law , for sure will be very difficult to understand what is regulating , but when a teacher gives you some facts it is much clear and you really understand what is that law trying to regulate .

6623,1079141.txt,P1,DEU,medium,"I think a basic knowledge is necessary , but in my oppinion our society needs more people who are familliar with one specific subject .
Having broad knowlege does not necessarily helps you to solve a specific problem .
In my home country for example , there are many people who can handle a computer , but there are only a few who have enough knowledge to deal with certain problems on their own .
That 's one reason why many computerfirms hirer people from countries like India .
This situation is not so good for our inhabitants , because often they do not get a job .

This is only one example for why specialization has advantages for the economy of a country .
There is no doubt on that employees need a broad knowledge to be flexible , if they for example lose their job , which is a great problem in our country .
But I think , if there are experts for almost every area , a country 's economy has many advantages , altough it is very risky for the inhabitants to specialize , because they may get no job in their specific academic subject .

But as I said , there are many advantages which support the idea of specialize in one specific area .
But it shoulb be regarded what size and capacity the firm has .
A big company has many employees and so each employee can handle a problem on his own .
If he need to know anything about an other subject he can ask an other expert for help .
So with the help of teamwork they can nearly solve every problem .
In smaller businesses this looks a bit different , because small firms can not afford so many employees .
So for smaller businesses it is better to have a broad knowledge , so that you can solve many different problems .

8337,1301504.txt,P8,FRA,medium,"i am agree with this statement .
indeed , to be successful , it is important to be creative , try new things and take risks .
i think that it is very important to do a lot of thing that we do n't already know , because if we already do what we hnow , we cannot carry on in the life .

To illustrate my point of view , i would like to use several examples .
In the professional work , it is important to try new things and take risks to be successful and not to do only what we already know .
if someone wants to create his own entreprise or create a new concept , it is important that he has quality that other people does n't have .
Why not open a new company creating an innovative and concequently a new product .
At the beginning , it is sure it will be hard , but if we never try new things we cannot know .

I think that so many people are scare about new thing and prefer doing something known .
For example , before the ipod or Mp3 players , everybody listened music thanks to a walkwan .
Ererybody was happy and liked it .
But one day , a man decided to create something new , with another concept and it was a very good idea .
We know that today Apple is very successful , many young use apple 's products and the creator is very rich .
Why ?
Just because he tried something new and he took risks .

I think it is the same thing in all the domain .
At work , a director prefer a employee who try new thing and take risks than an employee who already do the same thing , something already know how to do well .
To my mind , the first one will have more chances to sucess , and a better evolution carreer .

To finish , even in the artistic world this statement is confirm .
Indeed , at the beginning , a singer is not known , but taken risks ans trying to sing , he can become successful , even if at the base it is not his job but more a passion , an hobby .

Every humanbeing borns , grows and dies ; but the most important thing in this preiod of time is to fill out your life in the most proper way which fits to you .

Every period of this life cycle has it 's own rules and conditions .
When you are a child you are not able to do whatever you want ; furthermore when you are a baby you are even not able to tell what you want .
This cycle of life may seem a little bit unfair to us but actually it is not .
At that period none of us has to take responsbility or none of us has to work for earning money , so may be those times were the easiest and most favorable parts of our lives .

If you are in the middle period of your life cycle ; I mean if you are a young person , you are able to do lots of things without permissions , warnings or even concerns .
As I mentioned before while you are young you are able to do whatever you want and even stupid or risky thinks ; but in this case one important limitation comes into play , which is your metabolism .
As a perspective explanation ; people are allowed to do things as long as their health and metobolism let them .
If you are a young person without disabilities ; there exists about nothing to stop you or prevent you from enoying the life .
You can go to swimming , you can go to scuba diving and you can even try bungee jumping ; but we all have to remember that we have only one limitation which is our health .

On the other hand if you are getting older and , if it has been a while since you passed the boundary line of middle cycle of your life ; it means that you are not that strong as you were at your previous years .
In this cycle people start to loose their strength and energy , moreover their metabolism gets slower and slower day by day .
This of course does not mean that these kind of people are not able to enjoy , but at the same time it means that noe these people have some health limitations and not able to do whatever that they want now .

In conclusion everybody in the World can enjoy the life ; but of course not in the same ratio or amount .

8232,1280579.txt,P4,ZHO,medium,"There is a diversity of opinions over the issue of whether most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Nowadays , when faced such a problem , some people believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , Others , on the contrary , seem to have opposite opinions .
In my point of ivew , however , I fully agree with this position that most advertisements make prodcuts seem much better than they they really are for the following reasons .
Here are some reasons why .

First of all , consumers ca n't deny that companies spend a lot money to broadcast their prodcuts .
Using pop stars or overstating their effects is one of their ways to sell their products .
However , consumers never think about where these money come from and go .
As a matter of fact , what consumers pay for what they buy going to the advertising because companies want to cousmers to buy their products .
There are a lot of similar products in the markets .
Only one way making consumers to remembe and choose their products is to advertise .

In addition , companies using advertisements tell people that how good their products are .
In fact , people always feel upset because the products do n't satisafy them .
Take myself for a example , one time I bought a food , according to the advertisement , that could helf me to reduce my weight .
Needless to say , I spent a lot of money and time to try it .
However , the outcome was making me pretty upset becuase it did n't work even thoug the company has guarantee about the effects .
After this experience , I never believe what advertisements say .

To sum up , it is not very wise to believe any advertisements .
My personal experiences and actual observations of life have led me to conclusion that companies spend a lot of money to broadcast their products even though their products does n't seem much better than they really are .
Companies not only exagrrate the abilities of products , but also transfer the costs to the consumers .

6731,1089601.txt,P7,ZHO,medium,"When it comes to students learning , the discussion of the issue has become a vogue during the last decade .
Considering soial atmosphere today , some people hold the opinion that learning facts is more important for students is superior to understanding ideas and concepts .
Others , however , contradict learning facts .
Personally , I agree on that understanding ideas and concepts because it has more advantags .

Firstly , thoes people agree on learning forget a universal truth that as a old saying that `` know the smell until you teste it '' .
As I remember , the people popular in the society all have strong abilities that can paly a role in their work areas .
The abilities can not be learned in the classes , because it needs to have more practise in the real society .

Inaddition , another more essential factor why I advocate understanding is more importan is that learning facts without understan will forget soon .
An example I can give the details of the argument : some people like to copy other 's work in order to hand in in to the teacher , but they never understand what the answers mean , because they just learn to do not understand to do .
Thus , they could't get the knowlogies .

Of couse , choosing the learning facts also has advantages in some extent .
For example , the tescher always give us right answer that could avoid to waste of time ; they also guide us a shortest way to reach the results ; and they do good for us to make a better life ; and so on .

But if all these factors are contemplate , the advantages of understanding idaes and concepts carry more weight than those of learning .
To sum up , based on the above discussion , it is obvious to conclude that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than learning factors .
"
19,4750.txt,P7,FRA,high,"In whatever lesson , we learn ideas , concepts and facts .
Ideas present the topic and facts are an application of these ideas .
I think it 's more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it 's for them to learn facts .

The way to understand well a lesson is , first of all , to understand ideas and concepts and then , understand facts .
It 's not reversible .
For example , in history class about World War One , you have to understand why this war took place and why all the countries were involved in this fight before learning facts : battles , events , great names , famous days ...
Another example happens in mathematics class , you see that a theorem can be applied to particular cases but you should have understod before all the concepts which are used in the theorem .

Secondly , I think that , in a lesson , ideas and concepts are more significant than simple facts .
Indeed , facts are just applications of ideas .
I mean that without ideas and concepts , you ca n't totaly understand a lesson .
You can partially , of course , but it 's not the same .
I ca n't really explain it but you feel differently when you 've understood all .
I feel kind of victorious when all is clear in my head .
You ca n't get all the details explained if you 've just learnt facts because they are not enough to get to the heart of a topic .

At last , what is the point of a lecture or a lesson if you just remember facts ?
Facts ca n't exist without ideas or concepts whereas ideas and concepts do n't have to be related to facts to exist .
I know it sounds weird but some fields of knowledge such as metaphysics do n't really have any applications .
However , they exist .
Besides , we always can extract an idea from a fact , whereas the opposite is n't as easy as we think .

For all these reasons , I think that students should understand ideas and concepts before learning facts .
"
10506,1713332.txt,P7,ITA,medium,"I do agree with the statement .
Facts are important above all as example or expression of the concept wich is behind them .
Facts are for sure important because they can explain things .
They can help rememberimg a thing ; they can focused the attenction on a peculiar aspect of the subject , can be helpfull to explain or capture the ideas wich they follow .

You can remeber all the facts that you like , but if you had well understand concepts you will be able to recombine them in different and original ways .
You may be able analize even different situation following the same concept .
To explain better my point of view I 'll take some accademic subjects as examples .
For istance It is not important , to me , remembering dates and hours of every single battles as long as you can remeber how the war went , why it broke out , who were fiting and why .

In history what it is crucial is the general setting of the period .
Another good example can be even a scientific subject as the chemistry .
It is not essential to remeber wich specific salt and wich peculiar base are combined ( facts ) , as long as you rember the way the reaction goes and wich is the result ( concept ) .

Reffering to enother subject as sociology what it is important , for example , it is to remember that someone 's behaviour can be modified by the society 's response to his action .
Keep in mind every single possible society 's reaction it is not that crucial .

To resume my point of view in few world : If I can propely understand the concept and the idea of what I 'm learning I will be able even to elaborate them and to use it even in different suituation .

I can recombine concepts in different ways , I can adapt them to a variety of sistuations I might need to analize .

2057,354664.txt,P8,HIN,medium,"I completely agree with the statement that ` succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well ' .
In today 's world successful person is not the only one who has lots of money or is very weel know , it is somebody who has done something different from the others .
There is nothing great if you repeat something that is already being done by somebody else .
Successful people try new things who move ahead and in a different direction then everybody else do .
Taking for example the case the ` Dhiubhai Ambani ' who is today being called as the successful person even though he is not present , just because he did different and tried a new thing that is the reson Reliance is so popular today .
The new care taker of the Reliance company are the sons of its establisher so we cannot call them as equally successful as their father as they have just simply taken over his bussiness .
What Dhiru Bhai did was unmatchable with the work of his sons as he started the bussiness with not much of money in his hand whereas the two of them now are just spreading an already established bussiness .

Taking risk is another part of success as it is a well saying ' more the risk involved , more the chances of success ' .
As one can also see that a good thing always involves high amount of risk .
To achieve good things one have to go through a series of risk involved as according to another saying ' to get the rose you have to suffer the pain of being hurt ' , and to get the success the risk has to be taken no matter how painful it can be .

Risks are involved in every new thing or you can say that risk is an internal part of every success one wants to achieve .
If nobody would have been ready to take risk there would not have been any new inventions .
To be successful in life one have to go thorough one or some other kind of risk .
Otherwise success would have been very easy without risk and every person would have been successful or you can say that every person would have been at the same level .

Success involves risks .
Suppose during the britishers rule over India if every person espacially our freedom fight leaders would not have came forward considering the risk involved and would have lived the way the rulers wanted them to then would we have ever got independence ?
Ofcourse not , thats why to became successful and get the independence they had to take the risk of their lives .
We can also consider the example of economics in which we say ` higher the risk involved i

11485,1886957.txt,P8,SPA,high,"Nowadays , there are numerous debates about the issue whether or not people success by trying new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
Some people hold the opinion that it is true that people can only sucess by doing new things .
However , in my opinion , I disagree with the statement because successful people can success by doing the same things they already know how to do well .

First of all , the crucial reason in holding my opnion is that when people do things that they already know they do not have to worry about the risks that follow after they do it .
For instance , my father is an owner of a supermarket .
He has run the business for ten years , and when we moved to Canada he is still thinking of opening a new supermarket here .
By doing this , he does not have to worry about how to manage the business or how to improve the business because he already has the experience of how to run it .
Another example could be when a person wants to switch to another job such as being a doctor , chances are that she will not be successful being a doctor .
Thus , you do not have to worry about what will happen next if you continue to do things that you already know .

Furthermore , another reason in holding my opinion is that by doing things that you already know will help you not to make mistakes .
For example , my mother is working as an accountant and when she met her friend Veronica , who works in the stock , she encourage her to invest her money in the stock because she says that it will double or even triple her money .
As my mother does not know anything about investment , she trusted Veronica because she thinks that she will never betray her , and invest all her money in the stock market .
As a result , the stock market went down and she losses all her money .
This is a clear example on how people can make mistakes when they do not know about the subject , and thus be unsuccessful .

All in all , I think that people will be more successful by doing what they already know instead of trying new things and take risks , because they do not have to worry about what will happen to them and also it will help them not to make mistakes .
Therefore , for these reasons I would say that risks takers are not as successful as people who do things that they already know how to do .

464,83182.txt,P4,FRA,high,"Advertisement has been widely critized for giving wrong information to consumers .
Therefore it is a common idea , with which I agree , that advertisers make products seem much better than they really are .
Numerous reasons explain the motivations and reasons to such a behaviour ; the defintion of marketing and the asymmetric information between producers and consumers .

First of all , to justify the statement , let us focus on the aim of advertising .
Adverstisers create ads in order to attract the largest part of consumers they possibly can .
That is to say that an effective ad is one that can make consumers believe that the product is worth being bought and of course consumed .

To that end , advertisers will naturally emphasize all the good aspects of the product in order to compound the bad ones .
Fast food is a fine example of this strategy .
Indeed , while all you can get from a fast food advertisement is its tasty picture and its low price , nothing is mentionned about the fatening potential is encounters .

This manipulation of the consumer is of course unethical and that is one of the reasons why advertisment is critized .
However , it is explainable by what an American economist named Steven Levitt calls asymmetric information .
This theory arguments and justifies my agreement with the essay statement .
What Levitt calls asymmetric information points out the fact that advertisers have a considerable advantage compared to consumers which is information .

Indeed , adverstisers have all the information they need about the product they work on .
It is therefore their prerogative to choose easily among those informations the ones they want to keep to make their products seem much better than they really are .

In that way , we can say that consumers are victims of such asymmetric informations .

Because of the aim of marketing and advertisers advantage compared to consumers when it comes to information , most

4395,762179.txt,P8,ITA,medium,"I really agree with this statement but I agree if we speak about really successful people and not only about people that had too much fortune .
But concerning on special people I think that we have to think what there is under success .
The most successful people are talentous , open-minded , ambitious and very self-confident .
This features can bring you to success easilly but these feature make also people never be satisfited .
So when they reach an important target immediatly the happines for that becomes an aim to reach another new and more difficult target .
For example , speaking about jobs , I think that the most successful people are not really interested in money itself but in becoming the best one on his job , without limits .
I think also that there is a particolur and exacting emotion when you see that you are able to become always better and that nothing can stop you , and perhaps there are persons that feel alive only when they risk to try always something new .
There is a faomous phrase that is : `` risk is my job '' .
It 's obvious that when a common person sees someone who is rich , powerful and that got everything you can dream risking evertything only to try new experiences or emotions , he colud say : `` he is really crazy ! '' , but we know that genious and madness are often joined .
We can see some examples in real life .
I want to give a real simple example speaking about sports .
Foe example the famous Valentino Rossi , the motorbiker , had been three times world champion of the top class with the Honda team and he had the best motorbike and if he had stayed with that team he was sure to win again , but afeter having won for three times the title he decided to change team and go to Yhamaha .
At that time Yamaha had a no-competitive motorbike and it was a very hard risk for him .

8108,1258000.txt,P2,DEU,medium,"Well i think it 's very difficult to claim that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
The first quesiton is , what are old people , and what are young people ?

It mainly depends on the person .
Let us say young people are between 18 and 30 and eldery people are about 60 years old .
In this case , young people have other interests than eldery people have .
For example , young people are visiting discos or concerts with loud music , whereas eldery people are enjoing a good dinner in a calm and relaxed atmosphere with classical music in the backround .
But i have to mention , that i also know people who are about 60 who still attend concerts with loud music .
For example the generation who grows up with rollingstonse or ACDC still goes to their concerts .
The only difference is , that young people normaly are in better shape then eldery people are .
The older you are the more problems your are getting with your physical condition .
For example , young people can make more sports .
Eldery people have to care more about themselve .
Maybe young people are often more flexibel but this is also a stereotype .
After my opinion this is not very important to enjoy life .
Usually , Eldery people can do the same things like younger people can do if they are carefully .
They even have one important advantage , because they usually have more time and more money to enjoy their life than younger people have .
If they have enough money , they can fly or travel to each place where they want to , whereas the younger ones have to go to school , to university or to work .
The young people either have n't enough money to do things or they have n't enough time .

Like i have written at the beginning of this text , how you enjoy life depends on your pesonaltiy and on your flexability .
If you stay in life and if you stil have fun , the age is n't so importan for enjoing life .

9989,1621334.txt,P2,SPA,medium,"Many people beleave that young people enjoy life more than older people do , as well as diferent cultures can agree or desagree on this asumption by their contribution to their culture 's development .

In some groups , cultures or families , young people are defined to be the motor of the group grouth , becouse they are suposed to studdy when they are young in orther to reach a high intelectual capability to create grouth and diminish poverty , in this particular groups , young people have more free time to studdy , travel and play sports in order to experience and learn what they need to .
So , for this groups , young people certainly enjoy life more than older people do .

On the other hand there are cultures or groups which beleave that young people have to work day and night because the older they get , the most knowledge they acumulate in order to become leaders of the culture .
Because of this , older people are rewarded by being able to make desitions about the group 's future and enjoy life .

from my perspective , today , we have the freedom to deside weather I enjoy more life when I 'm young or older , persons do n't belong to a comunity that tels them what to do , they deside if they want to be part of the comunity who travels , partys , plays sports and does n't do much during their first years of life , in order to work during their mid age until they are older .
Or to be part of a comunity who studies very hard and focusess on their profetional goals in order to have a retirement plan that will gives them the oportunity , solvency and calm to enjoy life .

In conclution I desagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do , every person should deside when to enjoy life , that shoud be every person 's goal in life , to have the posibility to chouse what fits their personal nesecities .

9833,1591119.txt,P3,ITA,medium,"I think that this statement is a real view of the today 's life of the young people and not only .
Because the first reason for this problem is that today , young people have not too many time to stay with their really friends and so do n't have time to help a communities .
Today this boys have always the same size of work at home for the school assignment , but when this is finished , they start to play with the computer or to do something of similar .
In this situation they have only a few time to try to help a community , but in this time they think to other things .
This communities , i think that may be helped by everybody , also in dayly life but with the today 's life , with only the money at the center of everything , only few people there is that think to them .
Now , infact , there is changing in the life not only of young people , the dayly work is different also for the time that it had in a day , with a lot of people working from the early morning to the start of evening , so they may try to help the communities only in the weekend if they do n't work .
But the family in the weekend try to do something together .
So with all this changing that there is in the dayly life of everybody , young or not , it is difficult to improve this sector of the world .
Also I do n't give enought time to helping my communities , and I know this .
But I had not too time today to support this and I hope that there will be some change in the life , to give some importance also to this sector .

Sometimes you see a 100 old man or a women that can talks like a 20 years old man .
This is related to the feelings and to the minds .
For example , if a 20 years old man always nagging about his life and always complaining about life and problems and never stops a moment to think and ask himself : is life really worth it ??
am I really sick or thats just in my mind ?
he will always feel sick if thats what was in his mind .
Accepting your life as it is is a treature and most people these days do n't have it !

there is a question that how can the older men enjoy their lives ?
to answer this question we should ask ourselfs first What are the pleasures in life ??
I mean it depends on each person .
some people think of parties and calaberating all day long .
Others find pleasures in their food .
what can he eat on the next meal ?

traveling is a pleasure for some people .
They travel all around the world to discover more places and meet new people .
others just find their pleasures sitting home watching TV all day .
so , back to our question : what can be the pleasure of an old man ?
you ca n't say really it depends on his personality , but maybe in my opinion he just love to sit home with his family doing many stuff that we see it as silly stuff but its really maters for him , like drinking tea with his son and discussing some things .

He never thought about making money .
He just liked to study everything he wanted to know .
His teacher thought that he could be a teacher of math because he never got wrong on math tests .
So , his teacher told him to have more time in math , but he did n't want to do .
He wanted have broad knowledge because he did n't want to study one specific subject .
So , he studied and studied , but he could not go to a university because he was so poor .
After he graduated from his high school , he wanted to get a job .

The companies wanted well-educated people on that time .

4617,804437.txt,P4,KOR,medium,"I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
For example , my family had a apple tree in our backyard .
When we get the apple from the tree the apple had worse looking than from a store .
Another example is I have heard that a company for selling foods , which are Manto and Dimsom , made the foods just good taste and good-looking , but not good for health .

First , when I was in my elementary school in Korea , my family had a apple tree in our backyard of my apartment .
We never gave it any chemical pesticide or never do advertisements .
After I graduated from the elementary school , my family and I could get nine apples from the tree .
Three of them were already eaten by insects , so we could n't eat the tree of them ; however , others were fine , but it looked really worse than the apples in a fruits store .
Even if the taste of my apples was better than of the store 's apples , I felt my apple 's taste is worse because the appearance of my apples made the apple had bad taste .

Second , I have seen that a company for selling foods , Manto , Dimsom , or etc. , made the food by the wasted trashes from restourants in the news .
When they made it had a good-looking , they did advertisements , also they put some chemical materials to make it has good teste .
So , the food from the company had really good taste and good looking , but extremly bad for one 's health .
There are still some companies like that in Korea .
Even though the food is not already eatable , the advertisments make it eatable .
For that reason , I agree that advertisements make products seem better .

Because of my expriences , the apple tree and news about ` Trash Food , ' I agree that the most advericements make products seem much better thatn they really are .
But , I also think the advertisements is necessary because I make the food taste better by giving good appearace .

9535,1537175.txt,P1,FRA,high,"I definitely think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , rather then specialising in one specific subject .
Firstly , in my opi it is necessary to have a broad view on a variety of subjects in order to understand our increasingly complex world .
Secondly , innovation , whether in the fields of science , business or politics , is often lead by people who have a cross-funtional view .

To begin with , the primary purpose of education is to prepare students to face the world with the right skills and knowledge .
The world we live in , it turns out , is increasingly complex .
In order to succeed in this world , it is necessary to have a broad understanding of several subjects .
For example , an engineer can not rely only on its engineering skills but should also communicate on what he is doing , as most of the great technical achievements of our times rely on a team rather then a single person .

Then , a lot of innovations result from applying a principle or idea taken from one field and applying it to another , which can only be achieved by people who have a broad understanding of several fields .
The post-it is a good illustration .
It has become a popular and useful item in offices but it actually results from the invention of a glue that did not fix well enough to be used in a traditional way !
Another striking example is the bridge that was created between computer science and biology in the invention of neuronal programming .
Neuronal programming simulates the mechanisms of the nervous cells of the brain , enabling the programme to learn .

As a conclusion , I think that students benefit from having a broad knowledge of several subjects , because it helps them to tackle with the challenges of our modern world , whether as leaders or as innovators .
Of course , this should not prevent them from acquiring more extensive knowledge in a specific field .

10189,1656816.txt,P7,DEU,medium,"Gathering new knowledge and understanding processes of something is of high value at every time in a persons life ; especially during study .
But how should a person get new information ?
In my opinion the most important possibility to get new knowledge is by understanding ideas and concepts of something .

By learning facts , you can get only a small impression of how something works , because it is very complicated to know everything in detail .
So by understanding the concept of the solution it can be assumed that this knowledge is aquired by the person .
When some facts are only learned they are not aquired .

By knowing concepts of something the things , missing by not learning every fact , can be dedicated from the knowledge .
In a lecture was sayed that a person forgets every seven years the half of its learned facts .
Therefore it is very important that people are able to dedicate facts from their knowledge .
So a huge knowlegdege of facts can be made by understanding things .
But the other direction is not easy .

Another point is , if many things are conceptual understood , the ability of understanding new things is higher than by people who learn facts .
So , if understanding of new topics is inceased , the competence in a sector rises faster and the specific concept can be also used faster .

After studies , many students will be confronted with researching new things and concepts .
By knowing and understanding other concepts it will be easier to adapt the searched concept from other concepts .
This ability makes researches faster an more successful .

I think that the number of cars in use in the next twenty years will be the same that there are today .

I hope that the number of cars decrease , but I 'm not sure that it happen .
In Italy , the country where I live , the situation is very difficult .
Everyday in the street there are a lot of cars , so there are also a lot of pollution and also a lot of incidents .

Today the cost of life is very high , so for many people is difficult to buy a car and they use the public transport like bus , taxi , train or underground ( metro ) .

In Italy , in my opinion , the public transport is not very development and I think that instead is important to increase this type of service .
For example there are a lot of people , that live far away the place where they work , that everyday go to work by car , in spite of there are orher possibility to go like train as I have just said before .

But in Italy I know because the people prefer to use car instead of train or other public transport , because they are always in late and they are not efficent .

Failing is a very unpleasent thing and the best way to avoid failing is not to do anything .
But if history has teach us something is that the only way to improve and be successful is to try new things and take risks , no matter how hard or painful this might be .

The western world as we know it , came hand by hand with the industralization .
This period of the history is known to be time where steam and dreams made able massive productions , better goods and incrisse in quality of life .
Without people taking risk and failling hundreds of times before finding solutions , none of these could happened .

Another good example of the results of risk taking actions is the development of the airplanes .
Probably all of us have seen some old movies of the first plane prototypes .
Crazy machines that look more like games than real planes .
But after years of trail and error someone got it right .
And thanks to that , it is possible to travel in hours to places that otherwise would be impossible to reach .

I have apersonal personal exaple , as a Brand Manager of a wine company .
No one believed that we could develop a wine to be as fun as beer .
`` It is simply not wine essence to be fun '' an important manager ones said .
But me and my team strongly believed that it was possible to do it .
So after a lot of mistakes we finally developed `` FRESSCO '' a new brand that combines wine with fresh fruit in a completelly innovative packaging .
The results , FRESSCO is now one of top 3 wines sold in Chile and it has become a real competitor to beers .

So , concluding , even if been afraid to do something new is always a challenge for any person , is fundamental to know that innovation is the only way to progress .
It is true , mistakes can really be painful , but the reguard of doing something new compensates all .

In my opinion , I certainely believe that to be successful , you always have to challenge yourself with new things to promote your abilities .

When you are routinely doing an activity , you become an expert at it after some time , and you gain no further knowledge about it .
Take for example , a teacher who has been teaching the same seventh grade math curriculum for ten years .
At the start of his work he will be enthusiastic , thriving on new ways to teach , and trying to do his best in class to convey the concept .
In a couple of years time , he might develop new and innovative ways to pass the concept to his students , but after he reaches that , he will have no further motive to enhance because he will have reached a peak .
His teaching methods might even decline .

Consider this same teacher moving to a new school , that teaches math in different ways , or even teaching other levels other than seventh graders .
His new experiences will broaden his knowledge and prospective about the subject , and will make him a more experienced teacher .

Although moving to the new school requires him to take a risk , because he was already known to be good at his old school in the particular grade he taught , moving opened a new and challenging field for him .
It allowed him to learn new approaches , deal with different age groups , and add to his overall teaching experience .
He can be a more successful teacher because he dealt with different areas of his work instead of doing the same thing over and over again .

To be a successful person , you should never let the fear of losing stand in your way .
Always take risks , and seek new opportunities to help you grow and develop in your work environment or community .

695,114142.txt,P7,TEL,medium,"I agree that students should undestand the ideas and concepts than spending time in learning facts .
I believe that the human civilization has come to the zenith of technology not because of learing the facts , but by understanding the ideas and concepts .

There have been advancements in many areas .
If the humans spend all their time on facts , our lives could have been ended in undestanding the history of our earlier generation .
And we could not have seen the progress .
There could have been no progress of science .
So , applying the concepts of the facts will move the world to the next levels .

I always liked science which make me a scientist not because I know the facts , but the way I undestand ideas and concepts .
I am taking a mathamatics call I will use the concepts and idea to get to generate a solution to the problem .
If we use fact there will be times , they will not help get the solution .

In our daily life , we live with ideas and concepts .
A very besic example , If my parents want me to go buy vegetables form the vegetable market I will decide which way will be easier road .
I will analze by asking myself using my concepts and not go with the facts .

Our human mind can take only some facts and then we have to use the concepts to work towards succuss .
There are many facts in this world and it will not be in our human abiliites to know all the facts .
so it is more important that to know how to apply the concepts and ideas .
To deal with the problem .

On a whole , I think that facts can only help to certain level but most importantly it is the ideas and concepts that will hlep us in dealing with daily lives , in our career and also in work .

When you make the plan of trip , which do you choose ?
Someone will say that going as a group with a tour guide is the best way , because a tour guide tell any infomation and there are no time to make the plan of tour .
A tour guide will provide much infomation , but I can not agree with this opinion .
Trip is my own event , there are my preference .
I want to make own plan .
Time schedule is not free , and it is hard to care group members if I go on a trip as a group .

The tour has the program , a tour guide explain about history or any infomation , then I can not change it .
If it differ from my preference , the tour will be boring .
It means waste of money and time .
Preference of people is various , then it is not the best way to going on a trip as a group .

The time schedule is decided in a group tour , it is not free .
When I want to take many picture , if I go alone , I can take freely .
However , if I go as a group , a tour guide will tell us the time to back .
I can not enjoy if there are time schedule that someone decided .

The travel as a group has many members .
I have to care about their feeling or preference and talking .
It is hard .
When I go on a trip , I want to reflesh .
The effort of caring members makes me tired .
It is not good trip .
It is better to going alone .

As I mentioned above , I can not agree with the opinion that the vest way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
When I go on a trip , I would like to go alone rather than go as a group .
I can make the schedule depend on my preference , and make free time schedule .

11559,1899820.txt,P2,TUR,medium,"The lifestyles and activities of the young and old people are always compared .
While the young people think that the way of life old people lead is slow and boring , old people complain about the speed of the young people 's life .

People , young or old , have a limited time to live ..
In addition to this people should live their life full of enjoy and with activities .
Wecan clearly observe that there are more activity for the young people around .
It can be seemed as a discrimination but it must be accepted that in today 's world young people spend ore time at outside and also spend more money .
In this situation it can be concluded that young people have more chance to enjoy life .
On the other hand , what about the people whose age is old but young himself ?
I mean that sometimes age does not the meaning of everything .
Person who has had a enjoyful life can continue his life in same way .

In addition to this , the concept ` experience ' is very important .
When the people are young they do not have the chance of aware of what is true and wrong .
Therefore it is possible to make mistakes and destroy his life .
Ofcourse it is not something certain but even it is just a possibility it is a situation that must be thought on .
On the other hand old people who had several mistakes before gains experience and make less mistakes .
And in my opinion it is a good way of enjoying the life .

Another important thing is that enjoying life is also up to the preferences and ideas of the people .
There can be young people who enjoy doing things that associated with the old people .
For instance , a young person may not like the night life .
Instead of this he may prefer to dtay at home nd chat with family at nights .
Another example is fishing with a boat .
Most of the young people think that it is boring but it can be also a source of enjoy for a young person .

In conclusion , it is important to belive in life and its beauties .
If a person knows how to enjoy life it is not importanr if he is old or young .

9840,1591899.txt,P4,TUR,medium,"Have you ever thought about the advertisements on TV , magazines , or newspapers ?
Are they really showing the real value of the products ?
This discussion is still talking among people and scientists .
There are many companies producing new products .
So , they have to sell these products in some ways .
One of the most effective way is advertisements .
How do the advertisements show this products to us ?
According to me , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
There are two reasons for this : the companies cannot spend much more money for their products than they spend now , and there is no good reason to trust advertisements .

First of all , the companies are playing an important role in this schene .
Why ?
Because they are producing lots of products .
When they are making these products , they have to be careful about the prices and quality .
These two things are very opposite .
If you want to make a good product , you should spend money for this , or you can just spend little money for your product , but it cannot be a good production .
If you became a manager or owner of a factory , which would you prefer ?
Companies in this sector are producing their products with cheap costs .
So , the products are not really qualify .
After that , they will sell these products , but how ?
Advertisement is a good answer to this question .
They will you TV , magazine , or newspaper for their products .
In this time , advertisements show these products seem much better than they really are and people are buying these products .
In business life , the important thing is to earn lots of money from their produts by using advertisements .
So , these advertisements are very useful for selling them .

The second thing is that there is no good reason to trust advertisements .
For example , on the magazines or newspapers there are some products to become thinner and they are giving a chance to have a good body shape for people .
In the advertisements , there are some effective pictures in order to sell these products , but how can we trust these products ?
There is no good reason and also these medicines or products can be very dangerous for our body .
Maybe we can die because of these products .
If you want to have a good body shape , you should go to doctors and take some advises from them .
You sholud n't believe these advertisements if you want to be healthy .

Consequently , there are lots of advertisements on media and they are introducing many products .
We should't forget that these advertisements are making products seem much better than they really are .

6911,1106076.txt,P6,TEL,medium,"I agree the statement that `` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' because generally people want to visit different places to relax themselves and wants to know more about different places .
If they wont keep tour guide they takes much time to know about the place .
At the same time if a person goes alone to visit the places , he doesnt get interest to watch the palces and he cant express his ideas , thoughts about the palce what he see .
If it is the case , that he travels along the group and with tour guide , makes the peoples tour successful and happy because the tour guide can explains about the places briefly and interestingly providing a well knowledged tour guide .
If the person travel along the group he can have a advantage to express his views and get other views about thr place they see .

Generally tours are included with long time night and day journey .
At this time tour guide can where to stop the vehicle for emergency and where should not .
At the same time if anything happens to anyone , others can help out in solving the problem they face .
By travelling in a group along with tour guide they can help out each other and they can make thier most successful .

During journey , they face many problems like food , shelter for changing clothes etc .
If the people go tour along group they can help out in providing shelter , food and other small and big problems .

If suddenly vehicle break down and if it takes few hours to repair then they can have nice time with thier mates .
Simply they pass the time happily and unforgettable .
Anyways thats all depends on the individuals but going along with group makes the individual to see the things happily and great scope to have good knowledge on place what they see .

If we take an example of industrial tour of engineering students like Tata motors in India etc .
There i definately prefer to go along with group because they have to recollect their subject when they see the industry .
At the same time your professor acts as tour guide .
No one can recollect the information at that moment what they studied but if you go with a group they can share their own knowlege with other such that they can see the things more interstingly and gain more knowledge .
Similarly if a office staff wants to improve thier industry , there it is need to visit higher industries and should make points what should improve in their industry .
This is possible only when he goes along with teammates and guide .
He can point out very good things if he discuss the things with his mates .
At the same he need not to spend much time to know the unknown thing as guide is provided for them .

Thus i can strongly agree that The best way to travel is in group led by a tour guide .

4481,778366.txt,P5,FRA,high,"Whether the amount of cars will be smaller in twenty years time is almsost unpredictable .
The reason is that such matters highly depend on the political and socio-cultural mood of the time .
The answer also shifts according to the part of the world one is talking about .
The numbers of cars might fluctuate in completely different ways depending upon whether one is talking about developed or developing countries .
This essay therefore take different turns depending on the different scenarios and countries that are being discusses and based on the knowledge of facts available today .

I will now concentrate on the developed countries such as the United Kingdom or the United States .
Within the next twenty years , or even within the next decade , it will be impossible to deny the strength of the arguments that the environmental lobby and personalities such as Al Gore have been putting forward .
I believe it is slowly becoming clearer that the enromous amounts of greenhouse gasses found in the atmosphere are largely caused by human actions and will have potentially disastrous effects on the environment .
I believe that there will come a time when cars will not run on petroleum anymore , but on alternative energy .
That might not reduce the number of cars , but it will reduce the effect that cars have on the environment .
Another possibility , is that states will invest more in public transportation .
If that were the case , the amount of cars might reduce by a good amount .

The amount of cars in developing and thirld world countries such as most countries in Africa , will hopefully and in my opinion be higher in twenty years time .
It is my belief that a substantial car industry and a high amount of cars per family are indications of flourishing economies .
The ratio of cars per family is much higher in developed countries than in developing ones .
Thus if thirld world coutnries manage to get a grip on their economy and safety , the number of cars are likely to raise .

9498,1529450.txt,P1,HIN,high,"During our last few school years , we are faced with choosing subjects which we would like to specialise in , in the future .
Some students choose a small number , while others take almost as many as possible .
The student with the more subjects will be more skilled than the other , and will have better career opportunities later on .

When one specialises in one specific subject , he or she can excel at it perfectly .
This can benefit us in many ways .
For example , if a person is so good at something , he or she will be so skilled , and will be able to perform the task successfully and efficiently , saving time and energy .

On the other hand , when specialising in only one particular subject , we are limiting ourselves and are unable to reach our full potential .
Having a broader knowledge of many academic subjects is more useful than excelling in just one , as not only does it give you more skills , it also increases your chance of success in the future .

Think about it logically ; would you rather employ someone who can only perform one task , than employ someone who can perform dozens ?
I would choose the latter .
Studying a variation of subjects also keeps us more fulfilled , and less bored .
If you studied the same subject over and over again , for a vast period of time , you would get extremely weary of the subject , and therefore would make it seem very uninteresting .

You are given so many opportunities in this life , so what is the point of wasting them .
You must always strive for the best and want to learn more .
Why limit yourself to just one thing ?
Although sometimes it is useful to excel at something , I disagree with the statement ` It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . '

Second , people in U.S or in other country start to do not beleive that advertising is not compare honesty .

They dont talk about the products and its favors , they tried to catch the customers in a diffrent way , show .

1209,198987.txt,P1,FRA,medium,"A lot of people specialize themseves in one specific subject at university and take corses in the same department in order to have degrees in a particular field .
We can wonder if it is good to have a specialized knowledge or a broad one .

Having a specialized knowledge on an academic subject could be great if it is in the view of being a researcher , a specialist or a technician in a certain field .
Moreover , it is easier to concentrate on one specific subject during studies and it is easier being more known because specialist of some subject are rare .
For example , it is rare to find a specialist in treatments water process and so some people who are could have more chances to find a job after graduation .

To the opposite , having an overview of sciences and some knowledge about religions and phylosophy is necessary in every day life and also because some fields could cross others .
For example , taking course about both politics and economics is better to understand the way a country goes .
It is also very important to discover things in order to know what it seems to be the more interesting and which correspond the most to a personnality .

According to me , the best is to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects at the beginning of the scholarship and to specialize at the end .
It is like that the American universities work and I think it is better than in France because people are too specialized .
In United States students must have credits from others departments they are studying in in order to have an awarness and a culture more important and so they can compare and choose a field in which they are interested in in order to specialize themselves after .

3734,649766.txt,P4,JPN,low,"I disagree with `` Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . ''
It is just like advertisements tell a lie to consumers .
For example , when my father watched a CM of clearner product on TV , advertisements said that it could erase all of things such as , coffee or ink .
After he used it , it could not erase coffee one .
It was not ture that the cleaner could erase coffee .
He was really angry with it , and he said he would never buy priducts at the company .
As a consumer , you cannot know about products which you cannot use for a test before you buy it .
You just watch some CMs of a prodict or look a product in the store .
The other view is advertisements is to sell products a lot to consumers , so it might be natural thing for them to make products seem much better than they really are .
However , that is really big criminal at the point of telling a lie .
Becuse of that , consumers should need to compare with other products , and you should decide by yourself which one is good .
Also you have to use our mind and think about `` Is that CM really true ?

8533,1340850.txt,P8,JPN,medium,"I believe that people who are successful try a lot of new things even though they have high risks for the following reasons ; changeing time , improve themselves , and enjoying themselves .

First of all , time must be changeing .
Our life style are changeing with time change .

Their transportation was horse , caws , and so on .
However , now , we cannot live without cars , especially in the United States .
A person , who made car at first , may be successful , and made us more convinience to live .
One idea can change our life .

Second , when we are trying a new things , we can learn how to endure without conciousness .
When we learn new things , we need a lot of knowledge , infortmation , and results of tests .
It will take a long time .
I respect to Mendel , who identified the existance of DNA in 19th century .
He tried mating peas again and again .

Finally , trying new things make ourselves happy .

For example , I am very interested in Science , especially Biochemistry .
When I study it , I am excited and I enjoy studying it .
When I get good score on tests , I am very glad to study it hard .

This is a great question and also it could be a big dilemma .
Based on my own experience is how i reach this conclusion .

Nowadays i am dentist , but i just got my degree five months ago .
While i was still in my fourth year of university , i came up with the same question .
I was a very good student with high grades , but all i could talk to people about was teeth and the oral cavity .
I even used to say , as a joke , that i had tooth-shaped brain !

I felt really bad about my reality so i looked forward to find an extracurricular activity that had nothing to do with dentistry .
Thus i registered myself for the Selection of the Universidad Central de Venezuela in the World Model of the United Nations ( WorldMUN ) .

WorldMUN is an event organized by Harvard University with the purpose of gathering students from universities from all over the world , in order to discuss the current agenda of the UN ; in other words , students play the role of diplomatics that defend the position of certain country , regarding an especific topic of real life .

I have to admit that it was quiet hard for me because the training process implied to study and know many things about general culture , universal history and current world events , and those where subjects i was not familiar with at all .
But after a huge effort , i finally got to go to Beijing , China in march of this year , with 28 other UCV students .
The team got the first prize among more than 200 other universities from around the world .

That does not mean that i am not interested anymore in getting an specialization of my career .
On the contrary `` i want '' now to do an oral and maxillo-facial surgery specialization .

So my conclusion is that someone does not need to be completely in favor of one option , i believe that one person can manage him or herself to have knowledge in many academic subjects , but at the same time , he or she can have a specialization .

And their number will not even decrease .
On the contrary , the development of cars will be surprising and momentous .

Twenty years can be a long time or a short time , but the development of the quality of cars , including speed , security would be tremendously huge .
People will definitely enjoy these obvious advantages in the thought of travelling more places in the world that has became smaller and smaller .
And there are also other aspect in their development .

As you know , many institutes and countries have been doing researches to find a fuel that possess both efficiency and environmental benefits .
Progress have been made in these researches .
And fuels can replace the role of gasoline , whose quantity has been declining because of the explosion , have two main choices .
First one , for me , is hydrogen , that can be fired and used for energy and can produce few substances that pollute the environment .
The next one is the usage of solar energy , a sort of energy that can be obtained from the sunlight using peculiar ways .

After about twenty years , when these two kinds of energy can be used in cars , people would like to make a use of these cars under the thought to protect environment , and this thought , will be erected in ten years ascribed to the education that pay attention to the education in this area .

Not only the improvement of the qualities of cars , but the usage of fuel leads me to believe that in twenty years , the number of cars will not decreased , but ascend in a large quantity due to both the improvement of the sence to protect public and natural environment and the usage of new fuel which will make cars the most effiencient and covenient means of transportation without polluting the environment .

I agree with the author point of view .
The number of advertisements has increased .
While watching a TV show , a person will have an interupting advertisement period in the TV .
In addition , most newspapers have specified a number of pages for products advertisements .
This huge number of advertisement has affected our thinking about different products .

Companies spends millions of dollars to create convincing advertisements .
This spending is considered part of the marketing stratigies .
It is well believed that the more advertisement there is for a product , the more it is sold .
The millions of dollars that are spent on advertisement is considered only a small amount of money in big companies such as Pizza Hut .

However , these companies do not care if they have to lie in presenting accurate information about their products .
Because of the colored and well designed advertisements , consumer will be confused about the real quality of the product .

Because of advertisements , some products have become more expensive regardless of their quality .
For example , Toshiba labtop is a well known brand .
Through out the years , Toshiba has proved that they have good quality laptops .
Overtime , toshiba laptops has become expensive .
Moreover , people around the world have got an idea stick in their mind that toshiba laptops are the best .
However , being a computer specialist , I have noticed that toshiba computers quality has declined .
Few weeks ago Toshiba company had to withdraw laptop batteries from the market for a specific toshiba laptop .
Poeple who are not interested in reading Information Technology news will not know about the battery withdrawal .
They will remain in believing that Toshiba laptop is always the best .

About nine months ago , I was convinced because of an advertisment that Assets air conditionars are of good quality .
The company that is advertisement for this brand is well known in my country Oman .
After buying two Assets air conditioners , I found out that these conditionars are not as was advertised for .
I could n't stand having them for one months .
I had to purchase new air conditionars .

People spend a lot of money because of the misleading advertisements .
They do not bother searching more about the product before buying it .
It is maybe not worth it to search the internet before buying a can of beans , but it worths a lot to search before buying an expensive products such as a car .

But there are some exceptions where even older people show their activeness for a long time which is in rare situations .
Young people can easily do the activities which the older people struggle for .
But even there are some old people who do the things easily .

Older people usually never dare for the adventures in their life for enjoyment where as most of the young people will not hesitate to go for adventures for enjoyments .
The old people probabaly will lose the interest of enjoying the life as they would put their interest more on the family matters , careers , future life etc , .
The young people having the plans for their future will more concentrate on enjoying the part of their lives .

Old people lack the interest in doing so because most of them doesnot have the strength to travel for a long time .

Old people usually select the actvities for enjoyment only at the times of some ocassion whereas the Young people will always try to find the reasons for enjoyment .

9710,1569422.txt,P4,HIN,high,"Advertising is one of the key factors in the success of a product in market .
Some people feel that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
I do not agree with this and will explain my point of view in the following paragraphs .

In today 's world , there is a lot of awareness among consumers and the product manufacturers know that they cannot fool them by giving false impressions about their product .
They know that if they give a false picture of their product in an advertisement , they might fool customers for a short term but in the long run customers will know the real picture .
Therefore , intelligent and successful businessmen refrain from wrongly advertising their product .
Thus , we generally do not see an add of a product that projects it falsely .

In today 's world , only the best products are able to sustain themselves in the market .
It is generally these successful companies who can afford to invest and do invest lot of money in advertising .
As the market is very competitive , there is little or no difference in the quality of products from two companies .
The motive of advertising of such companies is to catch consumers ' imagination , to influence them emotionally so that they buy their product instead of their competitor 's product .
Therefore , I do not think that companies that manufacture products that do not meet the market standards ever advertise their product .
Neither do they have the money nor is it worth spending money because there are better products available in market and consumers already know that .

If we observe the advertisements nowadays , we find that they are very creative .
Companies sometimes do blow up their product in their advertisement but that is just to make their add more interesting and appealing than that of their competitor .
They do not project wrong information about their product .

Therefore , I feel that advertisements project the product that they advertise correcty and that in today 's world , they cannot survive in the market if they advertise a product falsely .

First of all , its not good enough to know how to do well something without improving cause i 'll be a habit a tradition and its something i 'm used to do so a little bit meaningless : Doing the same sport exercise everyday is good but when i start to make my body stronger and more efficace in movements i thing its successful .

Secondly , life will be boring when i practice and live every single day the same way , with the same people , same place same time the same actions all time in all my life , nothong new nothong successful .

At last , the most important thing in lifei think when i qualify to qualify an action , an accomplishment , something done , successful , it has to be a new thing i have passed because in general in life a human being have to always improve in order to live and think better in society : For example when accomplish a mission or a work habitually done , there 's nothing successful in it , but when i create a new way of working or i invent something new , thats what i call successful !

Today , technology is advancing with a breathtaking pace .
Newer sources of energy are being pursued and more efficient ways of using resources are being researched on continually .
The demand for transportation will always remain and people would always like to travel in their own personal space .

The most common fuel that is used for running cars is petroleum and this fuel will be in great scarcity and its demand will keep on increasing as years progress .
People have already started switiching to other sources such as hybrid cars which provide a combination of electricity and fuel on which the car can run .
Researchers and scientists are continually trying to harness the potential of hydrogen ( H ) which if successful , can be easily used to reduce any dependence on other fuels because of its abundance on earth .

Governments of various countries are making efforts to make the use of public transport such as public buses and trains more common .
For example , in the United Arab Emirates , a huge project is presently under construction for the metro train .
Various governments are trying to relieve the dependence of a commuter on cars .
But , this does not mean that every single person is going to make use of the train or bus at all times .

Many people need to travel short or medium distances frequently throughout the day , pertaining to their job requirements .
There are also people who do not like travel in public or need to travel in controlled atmospheres because of medical conditions .
This category of people will always require that some sort of personal transportation be available which is also comfortable .
This requirement can only be fulfilled be a vehicle such as a car .

Therefore , cars will always be there as a means of transportation and will definitely not decrease in number than what is present today .
Various new sources are being developed and some may also be discovered by scientists and researchers .
It is only a matter of time that something more efficient than petrol comes into picture and replace it .

7935,1222065.txt,P6,SPA,medium,"Well , to see if I disagre or not with being traveling with a tour guide I have to explain first the advantages and the disadvantages .
Well , let 's begin .

The advantages

We can say that primarily there are four advantages to being traveling accompanied by a tour guide .

1. They have the experience that they know well the place in which you are traveling , most if it 's a different country or even a different city .
In case it 's a differente country in which there 's a different language talked , that 's a really benefit .

2. They know important facts that maybe one will not know in case you do n't know history or do n't understand the language .
3. I think , that the primarily advantage of being guid by a tour guide iis that you do n't get lost !
It 's normal that if you are visting a city or country for first time you can easily get lost , so , ther 's a great advantage !

4. A tour guide knows the principal places or the most common , the famous ones .

The disadvantages

About the disadvantages , there are also four ,

1. The first one is that you have to pay money !
HA ! ...
maybe you are traveling with exact money and you do n't have enough to pay a tour guide !
2. When you are guided by a tour guide you depend on the fastness he moves , maybe you want stay more time in some places and get out faster in other ones , but it depends on him , the tour guide .

3. Even the tours guide know many places , one can get into service offices and ask for information , you do n't have to depend on others !
4. And one important and final fact is that you can meet a lot of people by your own .
You can make a lot of friends , know lot of places you really want to visit , not only places all visit , instead many others !

Conclutions

I prefer traveling maybe with only a friend and between he and me I think it would be a great experience , without wasting and meeting a lot of people .

11466,1884478.txt,P6,TEL,medium,"I would like to agree with the statement that ` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide ' .
The reason for my agreement with the topic is there are plenty of advantages when there is a guide when we travel in a group .

The major problems which we face when we are moving in a group is that defenitely the group includes people of different behaviours , the time punctualities and there will be no coherence between the people , If we are led by a guide defenitely everyone in the group listens to him and follows him as he is leading them .
Another advantage is that the guide will be familiar with the places we visit and so we need not waste our time on finding the ways to that place and we do n't miss the places which are of greater importance .
Some people may think that hiring a guide will increase the cost of their trip , i think it is not true infact we will save alot of money we can ask the guide to take to the motels which we can afford and there would n't be a chance to e defrauded since peple tries to cheat the tourists who are not native to that place likewise we can even save our valuable money and can use for another purpose ..
Guides also shows the important places of that area as we may not be familiar with them .
For instance , when we planned a trip to canada on last summer we are familiar with the places over there we got only one week to visit all the places and we got plans to victoria and vancouver , as we know thay are located nearby but some of my friends does n't liked to lead our group by a guide they think that they will loose privacy but they did n't realized that we are lack of time and they decided to go seperately and we do n't want waste our time as the semester begins after the weekend , decide to hire a guide and we successfully completed our trip within time visiting all the tourist places over there , unfortunately our friends who went to the trip without a guide failed to return back intime , afterwards they appreciated our opinion .
Hence i would rather suggest a group to be led by a guide on visting an unfamiliar place , which would save money , time and provides us with the facility to enjoy the trip with more ecstacy .

496,89643.txt,P8,KOR,high,"I believe that we should attempt new trials and take some risks for more successful life .
Because trials and errors let us realize our limitaions , and so , we can correct our errors and try to overcome our defects .
In addition , though there are some dangers in attempting new works , it creats unexpected results , gives great inspirations and makes us stronger and better .

I think that most people have limitations physically or mentally or financially .
If we just satisfy with our current situations , we never improve our life and never experience better and hidden happiness .
For example , Beethoven , a renowned musican and a great human , had an ear disease .
He did n't even hear audience 's loud applause after the premieur of his last symphony .
However , despite his severe sickness , Beethoven tried to overcome his defect and created many new and innovative classical music .
Due to his efforts , today many people hear many exceptional touching sounds .
If he satisfied his situation and did not make efforts to overcome himself , not only he could be rememberd as a great artist but we also never meet many great music .

Moreover , I think that crisis and danger sometimes produce unexpected results and make us stronger and competent person .
For instance , many scientists have researched some risky and doubtful facts and they have found many wonderful solutions .
Thses discoveries have developed science and our life .
In addition , in my experience , when I faced difficulties in my job , I did not avoid them and tried to resolve those problems .
As a result , I could find various solutions and develop myself into a competent staff .

In conclusion , I do believe that trials and risks make people stronger and better .
We all have a brain and a heart .
I think that we need to use and devleope them through efforts to overcome our current obstacles .

11376,1868953.txt,P4,ITA,low,"In my life I see a lot of time that products in television are better than in reality , and sometimes I buy products that in their advertisement are prettier than really are , for this two reasons I agree with this statement .

First when I go to supermarket usually I see the products that I watch on television because I am a very curious person , in the many cases I see that the products are n't so beautiful .
Second I understand that the producers want to make a very beautiful advertisement because they want to make a lot of money and for this reason I do n't buy everything I watch in television even if I like it so much .
When I was young I did't understand this and I bought every products I saw , for example when I was fourteen years old I saw on television a very beautiful advertisements about a make up 's set .
In television I loved it so much but when I send my mother to bought it and when I had got it in my hands I saw that it was smaller than in television and the colours of the products were very ugly .

3746,650437.txt,P7,ZHO,medium,"Understanding ideas and concepts and leraning facts are important for students .
However , In my opinion , I disgree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .

To begin with , we can learn ideas and concpets in class and our teacher , but sometimes they do n't work in the real society .
For example , I worked in one restaurant before .
When I cook the fish by following the recipes which our teacher taugh me , the chef blamed me .
He said , `` Customers wo n't like what you cook by this way . ''
The fact improved what he said is right because the people who ate the dishes I cooked went to complained to my boss .
I was upset and depressed .
From that day , i do n't believe the recipets I took in my class .

In addition , sometimes facts is very cruel , but we need to accept them .
That 's the reason why I regard facts are more important .
For instance , I almost lost my job when I cooked the awful dishes by following the recipets .
My boss told me that the fact was whatever you cooked , the most important thing was the customers liked it , especailly about work .
What he said made me trust fact is the most significant factor again .

In short , I learned the precious lesson by realistic and painful experience .
I would n't say that understanding ideas and concepts are useless or not important ; however , I really believe that it is more importnat for students to learn facts than to understand ideas and concepts .

8446,1324279.txt,P3,HIN,medium,"In response to the statement given sideways , I express my approval for it .
Young people nowadays seem to be more interested and involved in their own life and problems than the community as a whole .

The present day world has undergone a dramatic change than it used to be , say a generation ago .
It has become much more competitive and demanding .
The advent of globalisation has led to drastic repercussions .
In today 's world only the best can survive .
Recently an article was there in newspaper on globalisation .
It was stated there that globalisation is producing rich countries with poor people not only in developing countries but also in developed countries like the United States .
The fruits of globalisation are mainly distributed among the rich and the highly skilled persons .
Unskilled and less skilled labor are no longer the recipients of these fruits .

This puts an immense pressure on young people to achieve great skill in whatever art they are pursuing .
They could not devote enough time for other causes , like any work related to the upliftment of their communities .
For them their own survival is the key issue .
They want to be a part of the ongoing globalisation .

Moreover , they do not find any potential benefit in lending a helping hand to their communities .
All they can think of is their own well-being .
Whether they are getting any output by doing so , is what the young people 's thinking is .
In short , the world has become much more materialistic .

Also young people lacks the sense of responsibility which prevents them in helping their communities .
They think that just by being a part of a community and following its rules and regulations is sufficient .
They have forgotten the fact that with rights comes duties .

So , I would once again like to support the statement that young people are not giving enough time in helping their communities .

` `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do . ''
In my openion i think it 's not true that young people enjoy life more than older people .
Happiness does n't come by age it comes by satesfaction

You may find a young man who can do every thing he wants but at the end he is not happy .
Or you may also find a young man who he is not happy because he does n't have the aportunity to get maried and to creat a familly .
Enjoing life is not about doing things that will make you feel younger .
You may find an old person who he enjoys eech second he spends in this world by seeing his grandchildren .
It depend through the persons intrest .
For example my father is an old man who have grandchildren but he is enjoing his life by spending time with his family and taking care of his house .
His happiness when he sees his children and espescialy me because i am the youngest getting high grades in school .
This is what happiness mean .

the material need is become very improtant for the people , whatever food , entertiment and spritual life .
People want to get more thiongs from the life .
People using a lot of ideas to creative the things what they want .
However , we know most adversisements make products seems much btter than they really are .

Many companies they made many DM and adertisments to attract their coutomers .
For the company , they just want to people to buy their products .
The advertisements just a way to present their thoughts .
However , the real product is not really like the advertisement .

The advertisement is an idea that the company want to express their thought to their customers .
Maybe they did not take about more how to use the products .
They want to the climents to keep their eyes on .
That is buniness .

On the ther hand , now there are many companies that they sale their stuffs in the TV show .
They provide the tset time to use their products .
If the custemer did like the products that they can return to the company .
From the tset time , the company really hope their custemers to know and to use their products .
They not only just want to sale their stuffs and they hope to understand what the costmer want and what they need .

The advertisements just a way to express what they company what to say to the custemer .
The advertisements can not be the real products .
It just a way to present the new stuff and new fuction about the product .
It can bot be the real product .
Howvevr , not all the advertisements are like bad thing .
The company still can offer good service and good stuuff to the costemes .

1902,328055.txt,P4,ZHO,medium,"Some people think that most advertisements does n't make products seem much better than they really are because some people think the looking of products are more important then the quility of the products .
However , in my opinion , I think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
There are three following reason which can prove and give more example for my persanal opinion .

The most importand reason I think is that advertisements know what comsumer thinking when comsumver are shopping .
The outside of looking of products is most point people will think to buy the products .
Therefore the advertisements speand more time to design what kind of looking of better for prodcuts then the time which they are design inside of products .
This points can help counpany to get more money because they dont have to spand too much time on inside of products design , and cumsumer feel interesting on products looing , so they buy it .

Producing inside of products easier then making the good design for outside looking is the second important reason which I have chosen to put here .
I was doing a research paper which is about disguessing how many times people usually spend on designing a new car .
The research shows me that design a new car engige should speed more then five years at lessest .
Because it has too many thing need to do for it , and sometime it has some techengle gap which is hard to cross .
However , the outside looking is easier to do compare with design inside .
Therefore , most off time the products seem much better than they really are .

Third , people usually care about the inside quility after they bought it .
The thing for people to deside buy or not usually is outside looking .
So people will complain the products when they bough it .
However , in this point the company give cumsuners ' money alreay .

11946,1969448.txt,P5,SPA,high,"Nowadays , in our countries we have a huge numbers of cars running on the highways , and it seems that something needs to happen to avoid this situation that sometimes becomes problematic .
In any case , I do not complety agree with the question .
Let me explain better , On one hand , we know the importance that the transnational company cars have for the economy .
The motor industry is one of the most important industries in the world .
So , I suggest that it is impossible to stop the production of the cars , without affecting other fields , or aspects of the economy .
And maybe it could have impredecible effects .
I am not considering the economy as the most important thing , this is not my aim , but unfortunatelly , we have to think on this fact , because we need to have good economy to avoid conflicts in the future .

On the other hand , we have new alternatives to support the impact that the cars have in the planet .
In this point , we should speak about cars that use other kind of energy and more or less have the same capacity to move us .
These cars use gas , or vegetal oil .
We have to assess this point to achieve that the idea of individual freedom remains .

In conclusion , in my opinion it is early to know if in the future there will be more or few cars in the planet , because it is not easy to answer this question .
Usually the people seem to think just in the negative aspects of the cars , forgetting the possitive points of view .
I mean , we have to consider that the car is one important aspect of our common life , and not just for enjoying , but for working or travelling .
I try to explain that , apart from considering the numbers of car , we have to know if it will exist the possibility for avoding the damage that the cars do in the enviroment .
I think that the people will create a new kind of car on this goal , for the future .
I hope so .

6483,1066802.txt,P4,DEU,medium,"There are a lot of products in the shops and it doesn ' t matter what you want to buy , you have really a lot of choices .
In order to convince the costumer of a special thing , there is advertisement almost everywhere .
I agree with the statement and think that most advertisements make products seem much better then they really are .

The first example is the TV .
When you are at home and want to watch TV , there is shown a lot of promotion .
This shall convince the person for the product and leads him automatically to the next shop to buy it .
And because we live in a modern world , you can phone a number and they ' ll send it with the post .
So the persons things , he bought the best teeth brush ever .
And when he wants to brush his teeth , it breaks .
So you see , that the advertisment makes the product seem better as it really is .

A second example is buying a new car .
You saw it in a newspaper , the TV and want to buy it , because it shall be modern , fast and the best ever .
After a few months you have a breakdown on the highway and have to call the garage to repair your car .
So you learn that it ' isnt as good as the advertisement said and showed in the newspaper and TV .
You better think about buying a new car and ask a person who knows cars from his job and who could give you tips .

And not only see an advertisement and buy immediately !

Products seem much better as they really are because of advertisements .
In general , you can buy all products you want to buy , but you have to be careful about the advertisement .
Better try to find out on yourself how good the product is and when you thik it ' s good - buy it !

The world of today is full of advertisements and so the people have to be more and more careful about what they buy !

3357,582067.txt,P3,ZHO,medium,"Because I am a collage student now in Taiwan , and have a deep feeling of this situation that being indifferent about the environment around us .
I must give some explanation that why we students in our generations are fail to have time helping our communities .

We students in Taiwan are brought up by an attitude of life without caring about the environment around us , in a brief , we are growing in an selfish attitude even though the text book had taught us we should devote ourself while we can .
Most of time , we studying all the time to get good grades and burdened with so many pressure on studying .
As a result , even we want to help our own communities , we are really lack of time helping .

Some times I can see some clubs in campus which are tend to devote themselves in the servise of community , and it really have a great impact on those residents .
But what I can see are just a small group of willing people .
After all , what we students considered most now is how to get relax from our pressure and have fun for our limited young life , because we are pressed under the lines in the textbook .
Take me for example , it seems I should enjoy my college student life .
But I will graduate next year , and I am faced the pressure to apply the grauduate , I even do n't have time to relex because there are so many chores such as millions of assignments and lots of part-time job tasks for me to deal with .
How can I arrange my schedule to devote myself to community ?

I agree on this statement that young people do n't give enough time to help their own communities , but I think it is the education that cause this situation being indifferent about helping communities .
In my opinion , if we have the hopes that our future generation have a passion to help others , we should teach them this attitude totally from their childhood .

However , there are stronger reasons to support the fact that it is important beatiful themes to learn about you do n't know .

New things learn us a lot lessons and experiences to face many problems in future .
Education system 's many lessons are organized to learn us how to deal with many facts around us .
Such as self-control , self-motivation , enthusiasm , and many skills like that are detected and learned by doing new things , thus exposing us to varieties of situations build for us these skills .

Most successful people around world having in common some characters and interests , but the most feature liked among them is that they always put themselfes in difficuly situations in order to attain their goals .
For example , I took the toefl exam and I got a bad Score in it .
If I re-gain taking it and study on the same materials withe same mannar , I will get the same score .

The problem is that many opponents of practicing new things are themselves unware of advantages of looking for a new expertise .

1345,224699.txt,P3,HIN,high,"This is a controversial topic since the conditions are different for different countries .
Firstly in todays world of development and technology , there are many distractions like the video games , movies , computers and gadgets like the ipod .
Some people feel that community work like visiting oldage homes is a waste of time .
They feel that they can do things which are more useful fot the person than the community during that period of time .
It is sometimes this casual attitude due to which people lose interest in their community .

There are other factors which have led to the decrease in participation in the commuinty .
Youth over the ages have felt that the commuinity in some is demoralizing them .
For example in India , due to the poor conditions of the country , a child feels that why should he or she give something to the community if the community has n't done enough for him or her .
If this trends goes on increasing then lesser number of children will not try to help their community .
Sometimes it depends how the child has been brought up .
If the family never did anything for the community then it is bound that the child might do the same .
With this negetive attitude i do n't feel that it will ever help anyone , neither the youth nor the community .

However I think its not the same everywhere .
I tend to do a lot for my community .
As a family tradition every year my mother and I visit the local old age home and spend hours talking to them .
During festive seasons , we get clothes and food for the old people and even try to bring in more activities for them .
This has helped me to understand elders better and respect them .
This year I participated in a progam of ` EACH ONE TEACH ONE ' where we got a chance to teach little children from slum areas .
This was one of my most gainful experience and it helped me to be more optimistic .
I take part in several projects related to saving and planting more trees , cleaning the school campus , taking care of school animals for which i have recieved an award .
Every year we collect old clothes for the poor in our school and neighbourhood .

In conclusion , it seems that the negetive attitude of the younger generation is declining its intrest in the community .
It is not right because one cannot expect the community for us .
We as a member of the community have to lend a helping hand in small areas like helping in oldage homes , teaching children who do not have proper means of education .
According to me its a give and take relationship .
This means in order to recieve something from the community we need to put in our part of the effort and have a positive outlook towards all this and only then will our community will give something in return .
But i think someone has to start this cycle and only the younger youth can .

We can see and hear it everywhere , not only by the normal medium which the television or the radio .
Looking a sport match , or simply taking a walk on a street we will notice that the numbes of advertisments is visible increased .
And if there are always more pubblicity , the corporations who made the advertisements are in a strong competion with the others corporations who made the advertisement for a similar product .
This Competition are the main reason who move a corporation to tells lies about his own product .
In this way they wants to convince the acquirent to buy a product who should be positively different by an other from a different corporation .

According to this , the needs of the people change .
I think , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today if people make the good decision in twenty years .

In nowadays , the count of the cars are increase and most of the people use their own cars to go somewhere .
By using their own cars , they lose lots of time .
Except using their own cars , I think they will try to find new ways to reach somewhere quickly .
For example , in a long vacations , people will start to use planes instead of cars .
Because travelling by plane causes them to gain time .
Nowadays , in our country we can see the examples of that .
Most of the people preferred to go vacation with their personal cars .
But when the plane companies make the tickets cheaper and give the people opportunity to use plane , people begin to use plane instead of car .

Other reason why the car numbers will be fewer is the traffic .
The traffic problem gets bigger and bigger each day .
This problem makes people nervous and it takes much more time to reach a place than it can take .
They should try to find alternative ways to go somewhere to reduce the traffic jam .

The other important reason is reduction in amount of petrolium .
We know that petrolium is very valuable and the amount of that decreases day by day .
After a some time , petrolium will be find difficultly .
In this time , people will use cars which work with different product or they will try to use their cars less .

3139,544185.txt,P7,FRA,high,"My personal belief is that learning facts is more important and helpful in life than understanding concepts .
First , is it clear that a person who has learnt a lot of facts , in a word who has a great experience , adapts more easily to new situations than the one who first tries to understand the underlying cause of this event .
The former is able to imitate what he has already seen or done himself and to react quickly whereas the latter needs time to think it over and build his behaviour .
Coming back to the cause of anything to understand the hidden mechanism of action is starting from scratch every time and a hugh loss of time .
It is as if you do n't trust what others have done before in similar situations .
A lack of trust is basically a kind of anxiety that prevents from adapting to unforeseen events .

Second , knowing past facts increases one 's action effectivity .
Finding a solution is quicker when comparing to a similar problem that has already occurred than when modelising it into abstract schemes .
Now one could argue that experience is of little help to solve problems that are completely new and that one would be more successful if he understands the cause of the problem .
Well on the contrary , I believe that experience stimulates creativity and that it can inspire new solutions for new problems .

Third , learning facts is getting a realistic approach to life .
Focusing on ideas and concepts is too abstract in my view .
Of course this is can be seen as a superficial understanding of life but at least this brings liveliness and pragmatism .
And living is all about reactivity and ability to get in contact and communication with others .
Understanding deep causes of action is too theoretical and may cut counication sometines .

4163,722596.txt,P1,TUR,high,"Having a wide perspective and a broad knowledge in many academic fields is much better and necessary than specializing in a single subject , especially in our modern and diverse societies .
This necessity becomes much more apperant when one considers social studies .
Academic work in social fields , because they are mainly dealing with human beings and their actions , unlike engineering , requires a broad understanding of human behaviour in order to make meaningful and accurate assestments of their actions .

Many of the issues that we face today are very much inter-related .
It is very hard to isolate a single problem from the other and specifically study it without ever engaging its neigboring fields .
For instance , a sociologist who plans to study the criminal tendency among an specific cultural group must not only have information about the history of these people , but must also have an adequate amount of knowledge about how economic conditions which might influence human behaviour should be interpreted .
Moreover , she must have a knowledge of interpreting economical data , which would also necessiate a minimum level knowledge of statistical data .
Hence , as illustrated above , a study on criminal tendency would at least necessiate knowledge of history , economics and statistics .

Another difficulty with focusing in one specific subject is that it narrows your perspective and may result in disorientation regarding the place that the specific subject occupies within the general picture .
Every social event , apart from its internal structure or working , is also interacting with other parts of the social field in an active way .
Therefore , many times in order to get a meaningful analysis of the particular social structure that one is analyzing , it should be placed within a wider context and interpreted within the light that the context sheds on it .
Without this broader outlook , it is possible to fall into many cliches and misinterpret a social structure .
For instance , some practices concerning woman in many eastern cultures might seem oppressive to a western academic , if she only focuses on that specific practice .
However , a broader perspective which puts that social practice within the context , for example a religious context , could make it much more understandable .
The act which seems oppressive might be reinterpreted as based on the consent of woman , and therefore not constituting a form of power relation .
Therefore , putting things in context and looking at them from a wider perspective would yield to better results .

We are living in an increasingly diverse societies and it is much more easier for different people to interact with each other due to the advencements in information technologies .
Within this diverse world , any academic who takes interest only at a single specific field would be lacking the necessary tools for producing meaningful analysis of society .
Therefore , what the modern world needs is academics who are trained in different fields and academics who can put together information from different fields into meaningful wholes .

5397,942306.txt,P1,TUR,medium,"It is hard to identy the one way in this dillema having broad knowledge about many academic subjects than to specializa in one specific subject .
According to me , to spealize in one specific subject provide so much detail in one subject , creates experts in specific subjects and increase concentration on the issue , make team spretual , so the new achievements can be achieved easily .

First of all to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects make the one skip the details .
Therefore they can never have deep knowledge about the one main subject .
On the other hand , in the one will speliaze in one subject to do not skip the details , since it has so many time to focus on the subject .

Secondly , if the one try to know everything , acn not be expert of one subject .
If the specific subject is specialized than , and make deep investigation about the area s/he will be known as the expert on the issue .
Then after , I can call specialized as experts In addition to those if the one has broad knowlege of everything , s/he would not except the team work , since s/he can see himself as the one knows everything .
Fourtunately , the expert would want to get the others aspects about the project and can create the effective team work and brain storming in order to achieve the result of his or her project .
That means getting information from other specialists .

At last the expert can achive the result of the projects more easliy , since s/he would only concentrate what they should do .
If the help is needed than they can get help from other experts .
Therefore it would maximaze the efficeny of knowledge .

As a result , being expert , ehich means having specialized knowlege on specific subject creates team spretual with other expert easily , increase concentration and creates focun on the target and at last creates big achivement , so we need expert in order to courage big achievements .

People sometimes talk about this line `` a hero is someone who is doing a common thing in a not common way '' What makes a people successful is that he/she make a defference in something .
If the person just follow the rule already there and does the thing what they already know , how can he/she be different ?
How can he/she be special ?

For people already succeeded .
In order to survive among all those succeful people , They always choose to try new things to make them more successful .
Like most scientist , they could spend their whole life time in lab for researching , discouvering a new effcient way to make something instead of what we are using now .

In fact , the public recognize those peope who invent new things or discover something new which are very useful for people .
The gorverment rise scholoship , the universities provide fellowship , many company and organization give money for people do research as well .
A successful people will not refuse to take the risk to become for successful and make a defferent with those help .

All in all , my conclusion is successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do , however , what they are going to do is completely based on what we already know , knowledge is the rule .

There are three points presented as followed .

First , it is in terms of education that young people taked do not teach them to helping their communities .
Not only the school does not pay attention with but also the parients do not spend time at their communities , neigher do the children .

Second , it is in terms of entretainment that young people pay much time on and no time to helping their communitues .
Because of the interesting vided games comes more and more , the yough people spend all most of time to play and do not concentrated on the other things like homeworks or their communities .

Third , it is in terms of growing technology that many people enjoy cause that lake of time in their communities .

The action can be more well defined by using ` bring himself up ' since the process goes on like this : Up to some point you take the hardware ; namely education and consequently you define your route which goesto that ` milestone` .
Up to the second part the enviroment is so significant and if ever there are well opportunities to develop your skills it could be used so efficiently and this should be considered good luck since there are no equivalent chances everywhere .

As to close again to the subject some people are describing their tasks around scientific happenings and they have an hard job to deal since it is the most difficult part of the life to discover something .
A few decades ago scientists had worked on wide topics and there are so many examples of them who make different associative studies and made products even in mathematics and chemistry which are so far topics .
Furtherly there are much more examples who studied relatively close topics such as physics and mathematics .

In our century there are more available interdiciplinary areas namely the preliminaries are ready but further relations should be determined .
It can be said that a sufficient theoretical base have been prepared and with the help of technological revolutions the practical aspects are being performed .
But anomg these several interdiciplinary areas there is happening a more accelerated development compared to the technological development and there becomes much more work to handle .
The codes of the nature is being simplified but the humanity is learning that the complexity - as described in physical sciences the enthropy - around us is more than we imagine .

Some say that they enjoyed life more when they were young and did not have any worries .
Others say that only in age could they realize what they really wanted and could enjoy their life to a full extent .
I do not agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older ones .
To explain my view I will give an exaple of an unhappy young person , who was not able to enjoy her life and then I will give an example of an older one who did .

A friend of mine who finished school together with me was just as clueless as I was when deciding about what we wanted to study .
We both decided to take a year off .
This year was supposed to give us the oppertunity to discover more about ourselves and realize what we wanted to do .
I took this seriously and pushed myself to make a lot of new experiences , which have now helped me to decide about my future .
She wanted to enjoy her life .
She partied and drank as much as she could because she thought that this would be the right way of satisfing herself .
However , she was wrong .
She now realized that that was not what she needed .
She had not been mature enough to see what she really required to make her happy and to enjoy herself .
In this case more maturity would have been of great benefit .
One the contrary to this in the last couple of weeks I had gotten to know many old people who did know how to enjoy themselves .

I started to work in a nursing home for older people .
There more than anywhere else I have aquainted people who are in really bad situations but still know through their lifelong experiences how they can enjoy themselves .
One specific example would be a 87 year pld woman who had a stroke and consequently had to lie in bed the whole time .
Most young people in this situation would be terribly unhappy .
She lives with her fate and any time you enter her room she smiles at you .
It is easy to watch how small things can make her enjoy herself imensly .

The two example that I have made show that enjoying yourself has nothing to do with being younger .
I do admit that not all old be know how to still enjoy their life .
However , they are ofthen in a far worse situation than any young person is .
In general I think that the more experiences you make the more you learn about yourself .
This brings on a process of maturing , which shows you what is important to you and how you can enjoy yourself .

I have to say such idea is inappropriate since enjoying life is not a previliege of young people .

There are many types of enjoying your life , no matter you are young or older .
Everyone , at any age , can find his or her way of enjoyment .
Young people are physically energetic so that they can climb moutains , play Internet games , play basketball and disco dances .
Older people can travel in more peaceful ways like trip on a cruiser , playing chess and gathering to watch basketball matches .

Some enjoyment are just mission impossible for young people in the sake of age .
Family gathering , marriage and retirement are just patents for older people .
Imagine that sitting arounded by children and even grantchildren and enjoying a candle family dinner ?
Children certainly can enjoy much from it .
Meanwhile older people enjoy with another kind of happiness .
They may even enjoy more than others because of more memories of the family .

Sometimes , financial condition may also provides older people better chance than young to enjoy the life .
Owning a dream house is just a dream in short term for young people unless they got a sudden fortune .
With more money after many year of saving , older people can enjoy having a house , having baby , gardening the backyard .

This 3 reasons make them succ First reason is that they are aiming to enjoy from life .
For those people living in a world means , making researches about things that they do n't know and that they have n't heard of about .
And making researches about new thing cause them succesful second reason is that they always want to improve their abilities .

At the end I will learn how to take photo at least .

4105,713124.txt,P5,DEU,high,"It is sometimes said that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
In the following I want to give some reasons why I personally don | t agree with this opinion .

Firstly , for many people using their cars is the most convenient possibility to reach the destinations they want to go to .
Of course , there is public transport .
But when you travel by bus or by subway you nearly never reach your destination directly .
Because most of the people like to have it as comfortable as possible they will continue using their cars .
Furthermore , especially trains are a very expensive way to travel .

Secondly , oil prices have just started to decline .
This will probably lead to cheaper petrol prices , so the cost factor is also no immediate reason to use fewer cars .
And there is no sign that this will changed rapidly .
There are huge oil and gas resources , particularly in Russia .
So , petrol will remain relatively cheap .

Moreover the lobby of the carmakers is very powerful .
There are important brands with much influence all over the world .
That is because they employ hundreds of thousands of workers and a reduction of using cars would certainly lead to more unemployment .
As far as I can see they would dramatically protest against any possible restrictions of using cars and do everything to attract new customers with interesting features of their products .

It is also worth mentioning that the state itself can not have any real interest to reduce the number of cars .
Of course , the Greens are an important political party in many countries but finally the lobby of the environmentalists is not powerful enough .
The state receives much money from car owners who have to pay tax on their cars and on the petrol they use .
Nowadays , people are more interested in topics such as security and education than the protection of the environment .
So , politicans of the people | s parties don | t see any necessity to campaign for fewer cars .

Of course , riding your bike or just walking can be even greater fun than driving a car .
If more people decided to change their habits and think more seriously about the pollution caused by too much car traffic , I would certainly be happy .
However I do not think this will happen in the next twenty years .

5859,1013452.txt,P5,TUR,high,"The demand of mobility and access is not likely to cease for modern life , however the supply which will enable people to mobilize will certainly shift from conventional methods established today .
With this fact , one can go further and argue that twenty years from now there will be fewer cars than there are now .
Such argument can be coherent in itself if one is to see changing trends in mobility regarding alternatives and enviromental issues .

When it comes to compare cars with their alternatives such as planes , trains and ferries they all seem to be better than cars on some certain aspects stated below .
For instance it is a known fact that the average use of cars is around 1 , 5 people per car worldwide which proves how inefficient cars are compared to massive transportation ways such as trains , ships and planes .
In addition to this cars aslo create a trafic problem which is uncomparable to its alternatives .
Despite cars seem like providing more accesibility than their alternatives since one can drive whereever he wants and whenever , this fact also seems like it is changing .
It may be the case that , twenty years from now , planes and trains will develop to an extend that they will be cheaper to use and more frequent in destination .
At this point it should also be remembered that cars have considerable upkeep costs due to repairs and taxes which will eventually became a luxury compared to its alternatives .

Apart from loosing its chance among its alternatives cars will most likely be forced to reduce in number due to their harmful affects on the enviroment .
The fundamental need of a car to run is oil and this fact is unlikely to change in coming twenty years .
Regarding increasing concerns on the global warming this need of cars will make it likely to be replaced .
In addition to harmful gasses released cars also damage enviromet by creating sound pollution and indirectly by drivers demanding more roads .
The more cars there will be the more roads and sound pollution there will be as well .
Subsequently these will make people take a decision between altering their mobility styles or facing results of enviroamental disorder .

In conclusion , it seems that because of the drives mentioned here and many possible others that extend the limit of this esasy , cars are going to be replaced realtively by its alternatives .
Maybe these drives will let car industries to develop new cheap and enviroment friendly solutions but even this isnt likely to stop a change in choices .
It is because that maybe other industries will take the advantage of their increasing usage and will develop futher technologies which will make them uncomperable to cars .

10914,1785655.txt,P4,DEU,high,"I mainly agree with the statement .
Advertisements are presented in such a professional way that they are able to make costumers believe they need excactly the product which is shown .

Advertisement is made to show you everything the product can do or how it changes your daily life in a very positive manner .
There is never shown a negative aspect .
The key is , that advertisement is mostly placed at television in the late evening when the people are watching a show or a film and do not want to think about what they look at .
So they do not think about all the negative aspects the product may have , they listen to the music , which is of course perfectly chosen , they see images of great landscapes or happy families so that they are in a very positive mood .
And that is just what the company wants their consumers to be in , a positive mood , where you are more likely to buy products of every kind , even if you do not need them at all .

Furthermore , they are tested with a small audience before they are released so that the company who invented the advertisement can change some kind of it if the test audience critizes it a lot , so there is an improved kind of quality controll .

Another aspect is , that the firm who produces the food or whatever has to be advertised , does not create the advertisement itself in most cases .
They engage a company which is a speciallist in advertisements and so they know everything about what their consumers want to see .

At the end it is important that the statemant includes not every advertisement ever made .
There are big exceptions from that rule , for example when you see a saucege crashing into a wall it does not animate me to buy a safe car .
And you must allways remember that they only create an illusion , when you buy the product just because of its advertisement without comparing it depending on real facts with other products , you will not have much fun with your new product .

5917,1017901.txt,P5,TEL,high,"I agree with the statement that in twenty years from now , there will be fewer cars in use that were today .
More and more new cars are getting added to city traffic every day .
Improving economic conditions are encouraging people to purchase a car on their own instead of using the public transport system .
The city 's infrastructure is not being able to grow proportionately to the traffic resulting increase of jamming of traffic and accidents .
A recent health survey has shown that people who get stuck up in traffic jams are more prone towards stress affecting both their pesonal and professional lives .
Also , not to forget the pollution of air and sound these vehicles cause everyday .

One more important factor that would discourage the car usage in coming times is the constant rise in fuel charges and lack of availability of immediate and reliable alternatives .
The fuel production is not able to catch up with the alarming increase in the fuel consumption .

With the advent of metro rail and other advanced public transprt mechanisms which carry huge of number of people with short span of time to their destination , people would be inclined to use them than risking themselves getting stuck in a bad traffic jam .
With aggresive promotion of usage of public transport system by the government , the number of cars could significantly decrease .

Also , with people experimenting with newer ideas of car-pooling where a car is shared by a group of people instead each one of them driving one on their own may significantly see in the reduction of number of vehicles on the road .

Owing to all these factors , people in coming years will be less inclined to use their cars .

1943,335468.txt,P5,ITA,medium,"how many cars there will be in the future ?
it 's impossible to know , but we could think about different ipotetic solutions .
for example if the petroil will be less in the future probably an effective reduction of cars could be there in the next twenty years .
but maybe a new scientific solutions will be find , and a new engine like oxigen or hydrogen could be emply for replace the petroil .

in my opinion i think cars will not decrease in the future .
why ?
it is very simple , every year there is an esponential growth of people in the world .
what does this means ?
only one thing , more people more cars .
i think at this time , every family has one cars for each familiy 's members more or less .

for example my family is composed by 4 person , me , my brother and my parents .
me with my mother drive the same car , my father has two cars , my father 's company gives him one , the second car he buys for sparetime .
my brother has a car and also a motocycle .
at the end there are 4 cars in my family how we are .

how i could think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use there are today ?
it 's impossible .

the only solution , it is enlarge the public communication system , for example put in the city 's roads more bus or tram than now , or increase the railways services , built underground system in the big city .

to support this solution is necessary also an other factors : make cheaper than now the public services .
until now if i use my car is cheaper than buy a railway ticket .
every year the ticket is more expensive .
why does it happens ?
the governement shoul make easier to use public service not harder , also for a different reason : decrease the pollution of environement , use in the best way the nature 's energies and does n't waste them because very soon can be ended .

for all of these reasons , i think is necessary a large dose of good intention to make possible the statement : fewer cars in the future .

But others say that in the 20 years after there will be small amount of cars than now , because the energy is running out and the car is no more can work .

These two opinions are reasonable , but I agree the latter opinion .

Firstly , there is lesser and lesser petroleum the energy source of car .
But those kinds of resources are limited and someday it will be runned out .
Then , the car cannot work any more without constituting the energy source .
But within the 20 years it will be impossible to develop and commercialize the new energy sources .

Secondly , there are many regulations and consensuses about prohibiting the air popplliution .
The main source of air pollution is came from the car diving .
It will be more and more lessened to use cars all over the worled .

Thirdly , the traffic is so busy .
There are limted roads available which the car can go .
But it is overcrowded day by day .
As a result , the government construct many different transportation systems , such as railroad , bus , and subways , which reduce the road traffic .

In cities , at rush hours , traffic cause many people to waste their time on the road .
It results inefficiency to their work and everyday life .

In conclusion , in twenty years , the cars will be used little than today .
Because , there is little resources to run the cars , the car produce much polution which is regulated all over the world , and the traffic is so serious that the people use other transportation systems than choose cars .

11266,1847988.txt,P6,DEU,high,"Is the best way to travel with a guided group ?

For some people the answer to this question will be a loud `` Yes '' .
It might feel like an atvantage , because it wo n't take much time for research .
It is easy to go to a local travel agent , get a planed trip , getting picked up at a certain time , being guided through the differnent sites and coming back home on time .
Sure , it does sound great and it will work for some people , but not for me .

In my personal opinion the answer to the question , if the best travel would be within a guided tour , would be `` No '' .
Considering the background of my experience with traveling I have always enjoyed being with my family or partner rather than in a large group .
The advantage of this is that you are totally able to concentrate the trip on your personal interests and abilities .
You can visit different sites , museums and do all kinds of acitivties that are enjoyable and doable for you .

On guided tours it is sometimes difficult to stop at places of interest and move on to other sites , if the shown is not enjoyable .
Also the variety of interests and ideas is in a group much bigger .

Sometimes it might also be hard for disabled , old , injured or sick people as well as children to keep up and to follow the given information .
For those people it is desireable to have idividuale self guided tours , which can be accomplished with the help of travel books or prior reserach .
Of corse you will need to inform yourself before hand and plan the details of your travel .
But for me it always is an interesting part to collect information on the different opportunities at the places I travel to .
It does not only help me to plan , but also to learn more about the country or place I want to visit .
From time to time I even find out facts I have never heard of before and will find sites , buildings , parks and many more I have never thought of visiting .
This will never happen if everything has been aranged through a guide .

Overall I think people can get more advantages out of a self guided trip than a travle within a guided group .

my father have a hotel business he is a succeessful bussinessman in city after that he take interest and take risk in computer hardware business .
first year he ca n't successful in compuer hardware business but after one year he got an exprience and become a successful businessman in computer hardware business .

now in conclusion sometines successful people take risk and he lost his money or his credit in market .
he became unsuccessful this happen unusally .
so i gree with the authors claim is that successful people try new things and take risk and become more successful .

11492,1887879.txt,P4,ZHO,medium,"Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
This selling techinque is used to attract customers .
The advertisements mostly over-emphasis the multi-functions , the graurantee refund policy , and the prices of the products .

Most of the products are stated that they have more than one funtion .
For example , there are multi-functions of the most Chinese herbal tea .
If you drink such kind of tea , more than one type of diseases , such as headaches , stomach hurt , heart burn , and even fat burning , you can be healed .
However , most of the products from the advertisements do not state clearly how long the proclaimed effects will be work ed out when you buy the product .

Besides , most advertisemets emphasize that there is a hundred percentage of confidence for the refund policy .
If you are not satisfied with the product after you purchase it , you will get back all your money when you send back the product to the company .
However , such kind of policy has limited return time an specific condition .
For example , if you want to return a bottle of moisturising cream , you will have hundred percentage refunds only within a week of purchasing , and not more than one-third of the cream is used ; otherwise , you are not eligibled to make such kind of claim .

Moreover , the price of the product you seem in the advertisements is much cheaper than what you want to buy .
For example , the price of a dress in the advertisement is about 9.99 dollar per item .
However , this price is only for limited items or limited to specific stores , color or size .
As a result , you will pay more than what you espected .
In addition , most of the price listed in the advertisement is not inculded the tax or the shipping fees .
So you will paid higher prize for the product , rather than it is listed in the advertisements .

So we have to check all the details about the products we want to buy .
Do not believe what you see from the advertisements totally .
We have to become a smart customer .

9574,1545635.txt,P5,ITA,low,"In the next future the number of cars in use will probably fall down .
These thesis can be proofed with some important facts .
Nowadays the cars ' number is getting bigger bigger , congestioning the road and the city .
Move by car in a big city it 's very difficult because of the traffic , and move by car in a metropoli like milan or new york it 's nowadays almost impossible .
In addition to this direct mobility problem , the pollution provided by the elevated number of cars it 's starting to cause very serious problem in city living .

Another relevant problem connected to growing cars ' number is the raise of petroleum price , that makes fuel the car more and more expensive .
To fight this problem many cities are trying to promote the pubblic transport use , to reduce pollution in city area provided by car .
To improve the dismissing of the car in many town expecially historycal town ( like rome and florence ) , the acr acces to the city center was very restriced to a very little number of people with special permission , in other cases the traffic in the city center was forbidden at all .

Many studies about cars alternative car fuel are in act to reduce pollution provided by them , but the continuos growth of city and metropolies , and their overpopulation let see that in a not very far future we 'll not be able to acces city by car .

Nowadays unfortunatly the pubblic transport are not so good at work at your own car is , so many people are also prevented to leave their car in benefit of pubblic transport use .

But also in this case many lot of studies and work are in progress to give the people a very good service that can really answer their needs .
In conclusion i agree with the statement , and in twenty years , i think that we 'll must leave our loved and hated car in garage .

what is the hope of the humanity ?
A world with less polution .

The cars are more and more produced and used in all arround the world without any law for the environement care in some countries wich could be a desastre for the futur generations , for this reason some governments are looking for another ways to solve the transportations problems with less negative inpact on the environement wich is mainly caused by the car 's smok , Trafic jam wich are causing more and more noise into the big citis and some small towns as well .

on top of what I exposed before , people will work more and more from home , so they would n't need as many cars than today , the boom of the internet is opening the new perspectives for the electronique learning , home offices and electronique shopping and buying trought web sites using their computers and internet connection , we can see this alredy in the mature countries where some people are n't leaving homes for days so that 's giving them less stress and more time for home and familly .

To conclude , I 'll say that we have to find a realistic solution for our earth in order to leave it like we had it to the future generations , we have to use the technoligy as much as we can if it 's helping us to reduce using the transportations

The other possiple solution to build more and broader roads is improper due to environmental reasons .

The debate taking place about climate change and the convincing arguments scholars are giving us for the fact that , if we go on emissing such large ammounts of CO2 , we are going to face a serious climate catastrophe , shows that we are forced to think of alternatives to the nowadays used cars .

But I do not think personal transpotation systems in some other way will still be in use in twenty years .
I hope that by then we will be able to use a type of energy that on the one hand does not pollute the air and on the other hand is regrowing .
I am of the conviction that fossile energy is not a technique of the future .

An other point I would like to discuss is the question if people could live without cars , maybe even should .
Taking into consideration the millions of people killed in car accident I come to the conclusion that we should use a safer transportation system like trains .
Of course we face the disadvantage that a given person is way more flexible when taking the car than when taking the train or other public transportation systems .
I would recomment an improvement in these systems , for example a better network and more trains , in order to make the use of safer techniques more attractive .

Coming to an end I would like to again express my hope , that at some point in time we will be independend from cars as we now know them with their noise , smell and negative consequenses on the environment and our health .

By that they totaly forget about their community and the duties that have to do for it .

In our days today we have to give young people the maximume attention that we can offer them , because we live in a society that has many tools to blind them and make them lose the right track .
For example if we ask a young boy weather he likes to go fishing or go clean the beach from wastes , his answer is going to be `` lets go fishing '' , he might not even know that there are some people whom actually clean the beach .
This happens from the lack of attention that we should have given for them to know more about their community and the problems that their community faces .

Another factor which makes a young boy go fishing , is the number of places that we have for children to have fun and play and at the same time the absence of places that tell our children about out community and that we actually have duties towards our community .

It is not easy to make decission to take risk ; however , there is massive chance to be successful after deal with the risks .
There are some advantages on taking risk when people do business .

First of all , there exist your own opportunity to succeed .
If you operate a business with initiated item , there is only success or failiure .
When a person think that the item that he/she has is exotic , other poeple might think it is , or not .
If you read other people 's mind and invent an item that other people could n't think of , then your company will be the neccesary or need to other people .

Secondly , people who takes risks , they can save a lot of time .
As an example of the most successful person in the world , Bill Gates , he quit the college where he studied in .
After all , he invented DOS and Windows wit his friends and coworkers , he became the richest man in the world with very young age .
Therefore , taking risks could make a person become successful eventhough he/she does n't have school grade .

Finally , taking risks not just make you rich , but it also make you facmous and helful for other people .
Most of the successful people who took risk are famous and other people need them .
Being rich with business that other people also do may not be too difficul to attain , but being famous and be needed for other people is not easy to achieve .

In conclusion , people are afraid to take risks , but it is a chance to be more successful than other people .
With advantages above , it is clear that dealing with risks is has more chance to succed rather than do what other poeple do .
Taking risks could destroy people 's life ; however , if you are born in this competitive world , is n't it valuable to take risks if you can succeed ?

In this oultook , in twenty years , will there be fewer cars in use than there are today ?
Will they even disappear ?

I do n't think so .
Our current world lives under the influence of globalization .
Means of communication , physical or virtual , are playing more and more a sizeable role in our daily lives .
We build everyday bridges , motorways , we create networks through internet optic wires all over the world .
We live in a logistical world if I can put it this way .
In this context , I hardly imagine the end of cars , or the decrease in car numbers , which is surely the best mean of transport for all the citizens .
Futhermore , the emerging markets consume more and more cars and all cars manufacturers already produce millions of cars for chinese people or indian people .
In twenty years , we will not ` bury ' the car but , this latter will certainly take other forms , a form that will less jeopardize the planet .
I think about brazilian cars that are already hybrid cars .

Nevertheless , let 's not forget that more than 80 per cent of the population is urban .
And , this major trend will go on .
All the cities are already totally overcrowded by cars , full of congestions .
All the cities try to limit the number of cars .
London has even implemented a tax to prevent people from driving in the city .
In this context , we can think that in twenty years the numbers of cars will decrease .
Thus , clean public transport or even bikes or motorcycles will know a revival , will be born again .
It 's conceivable .

1013,166730.txt,P4,SPA,high,"Marketing is the main factor to make this a rule .
I personaly think that products have to look better in the images because the market competition you can found in the real world .

I have found many times my self with a product that is not event the half of good that I was expecting and this is the result of advertising .
Under controled cirumstances the color , the texture even the results of the product are controled by advertisers whom are responsables for the introduction of the product to the market .
And you belive it .

Some times products realy are what they announce and I think these are the expensive ones , not all the time but frecuently the more you pay the more you receive .
Some brands give us the idea of quality and we buy that because quality is important .

I do n't mean with this that we have to pay extra money in order to get better items , some times a particular brand have `` more name '' than others and this the only reason that justifyes this product to be more expesive but not because is the better .

We can find in the market a lot of different brands and quality equipment that can let us solve our needing .
It is in more of the cases the power of adquisition ( the amount of money ) we have the one that rules our buying behaivor .
You have more money , you can buy more expensive things , but not nessesarily the best .

It is a game that we play very often considering all the time the expese versus the quality , some times we just buy an item that bearly gives solution to our need but we are not willing to expend more money on it .

So it is importat to put in a balance what we are looking for and try not to be catched by the ilussion of advertisements because most of the time they are more atractive that thery realy are .

734,117237.txt,P4,KOR,high,"Advertisements , which are important in selling products , make products seem better than they are in order to make it more appealing to consumers .
Advertisers use many tricks and even false information to make the products seem better .
Advertisements use aspects that appeal to people 's senses , such as the way the product looks , smells , or feels .

Most advertisements use vivid imagery to attract attention .
Advertisers enhance the appearance of the product by different effects such as lighting or coloring .
Commericials for food products sometimes do not use the real product , but a imitation that is made unrealisitically .
For instance , when advertising a hamburger , advertisers might use a bigger or a more fresh looking imitation of the hamburger .
When a person actually goes to buy the product , they will notice a significant difference in the real product in comparison to the product shown in the commericial .

Also , many advertisements use claims that are usually false .
The advertisement might imply that the product makes a person looks more beautiful or has the power to make someone smarter .
A commercial for perfume might imply that the person using the product gains more attention from people .
However , these claims are highly exaggerated to make the product popular among customers .

Advertisers use people 's weakness to appeal to them .
For example , an advertisement commericializing a product that can lead to weight loss might show someone who is obese so that the consumer can relate to the advertisement and be convinced into buying the product .
It is important for the consumer to question the product objectively .

In conclusion , by different effects and methods , advertisements enhance the quality of the product , making it seem better than it actually is .

5091,886710.txt,P7,FRA,high,"In my opinion , understanding is the key to the educational process .
While teaching , a professor not only transmits his knowledge to students , but he also gives them the keys to comprehension .
The most important point is not what we learn , but how we learn .

For example , Education system deeply changed during past years .
If we take the time to ask our parents how was School when they were kids , we would probably be astonished by their answer .
Indeed , they were used to learn their lessons by heart , and this was a very mechanical exercise .
Sometimes they did not even know what they were talking about !
Education system realized its mistake , and changed its technique .

Nowadays , an important role is given to interaction .
Indeed , students have now the possibility to ask questions .
The answers they would get would help them in easily understanding the topic they are discussing .
As they get the meaning of an idea , a concept , they remember it in a better way .

Moreover , this interaction between students and professors allow them to show their interest in some topic .
They are not passively listening , they can bring their opinion , their ideas .
This can lead to new issues , and open their minds .
A concept can be spread from one to another , illustrating the very basis of development .

The thing not only about knowledge , moreover about reflexion .
School teaches the power of thinking by ourselves .
As the students understand ideas , they learn facts , whereas the opposite does not work .

10962,1794708.txt,P5,FRA,high,"The car has rapidly become the main way of transport for active citizens in the 20th century .
Still , some say that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use then there are today .
Of course there are many arguments that support this statement but there are also arguments that refute it .

In effect , the car industry is in no way slowing down it 's production .
On the contrary , news cars appear on the market all the time .
Most car companies are aware of the new restrictions for car owners and these new models work around them .
For example , when faced with the mounting parking problem , a company issued the Smart , whose size permitted the owners to park easily .
Other models use less gas thus working around the pollution problem .

However the arguments in favour of this statements hold more weight .
One of the many reasons the number of cars will go down is that right now , even with small cars , it is too hard to park your car in cities .
Parking is becoming an issue with commuters as it is also a waste of time that many could do without .

Also because of environment issues such as pollution , many governments encourage public transportation such as the train or buses .
In Paris , the mayor has rendered certain parts of the city difficult to access by car .
The bus service is becoming more adapted to the needs of the citizens ' needs such as comfort and availability .
To make trips faster , the street is divided into corridors , one for buses and one for cars .
Of cours there are still many cars so now car owners are faced with monstrous traffic jams while bus users just whiz by .

The metro system covers most parts of the city so many resort to the subway as means of transport .
If I wish to cross Paris rapidly , I know that it is faster to take the subway than to take a car .

Even though a car provides comfort that public transportation lacks and is also easier to use for your schedule the cons are largely outnumbering the pros and with the awareness of all the trouble the environment is having , many are rethinking their frequent car use .

I believe that in twenty years there will indeed be less cars is use , as they will be reserved for long trips or transportation in rural areas .

51,10345.txt,P4,FRA,high,"In an age of mass production and consumption , manufacturers engage in a harsh competition to survive .
The consumer wants to know that he is getting the most out of his investment and may rely on advertisements to decide which product would be the wisest purchase .
It is then no surprise that when companies advertise their products , they focus on its benefits - perhaps exaggerating them - and rarely disclose its shortcomings .

Advertisements of beauty products are a good example of this type of embellishment .
The consumer wants a mascara that will lenghten , define , and thicken her eyelashes without making them appear clumped together .
All cosmetic companies know this and , year after year , advertise a new mascara designed to do all this .
Dramatic pictures shown on television or printed in magazines display its unique ability to thicken thicken , but never mention that this same technology also leads to a clumping or , worse , shedding of eyelashes .
If the companies mentioned these side-effects , who would buy this revolutionary mascara ?
This scheme seems to be working , since the new formulas keep entering the market every year , and women are still buying them !

Diet pills are also advertised as being much more effective and safer than truly are .
The typical advertisement shows pictures of ( pretended ) consumers before and after using the miraculous product .
Of course , the `` after '' pictures are always taken in a more flattering light , with the happy customer wearing better-fitting clothes and often sporting a tan .
They are also digitally enhanced , to the point that one may come to doubt whether these people have even lost any weight or used the diet pills .
In any case , the pictured consumers appear thinner , healthier , and happier .
But do diet pills really bring about such formidable changes ?
Advertisers conveniently omit the need to balance diet and exercise in order to maintain a healthy weight and the customer is more than happy to purchase an easy solution .
Just the same , the makers of these diet pills typically mention the possible side-effects in small print , while the numerous advantages of their products are spelled out in bright , bold letters .
Finally , even if these diet pills are effective , the customer hoping to gain a better self-esteem and happiness may be very disappointed .
After all this person has not changed his or her definition of personal worth along with a new , shapelier waist .

In conclusion , manufacturers must resort to somewhat dishonest practices in order to sell their products .

It remains the consumer 's duty to understand this and to develop a more realistic understanding of what a product can and cannot do in order to critically examine an advertiser 's claims

To put it precisely : Your expertise in a specific subject must be accompanied by at least some broad knowledge of related academic subjects and common topics in general .

6602,1076792.txt,P4,ITA,high,"I totally agree with this statement , although it is rather simplistic .
I think in fact that it is true that most advertisements make products seem much better than they are , but maybe this is just due to the location of the advertisement ( for example a beach or a wonderful house ) or because of the short time they have to present the product , so sometimes a thing is shown really fast , when it is actually not .

Nevertheless I think that these are the only aspects that could be justified , but they are marginal aspects , not the core ones .
It is a shame to make something seem fabolous when it is absolutely not or when it does not function at all .
I believe that the media companies should avoid this kind of `` false advertising '' .

Many surround the product or the brand with fantastic characteristics , implying that the people who wear it or buy it are cool and special .
I strongly believe that this is extremely dangerous for the young spectators , who are particularly sensitive to these aspects and have not a defined personality yet , so they are easily convinceable .

Moreover some could be dangerous even for adults : for example the advertisements on diet products , which are provided with false witnessing and interviews , which explains how many weight they have lost in so little time .
I am personally particularly against this type of advertisements , because it is no more a matter of buying a television or a fridge which does not function , but rather a matter of health , which is much more important and has to be avoided .

In conclusion I think that the only function of advertisement should be that of making the consumer aware of the creation of a new product and not to overwhelm him with false and useless information , although the consumer should be however critic .
"
8820,1393001.txt,P4,JPN,low,"We can see a lot of advertisements in somewhere , such as a food , an electronic , or a glosely company .
People compare all of them and refer to buy infomation for some products .
They might have a favorate brand .
So most advertisements make products seem much better .

First , advertisement has lots of information of some products .
We can compare by an ingredient , a design or a package .
That information serves by company , so we can get absolutely .
If we ca n't get information , we should n't buy or choice .

Second , Most people buy only It 's package design or brand , so company can grow up , if do n't have espescially things of products .
There are lots of company in the world , such as Wal-mart or Target .
We buy only law price .
It is trick .

Finally , it can produce a high cuority things or a good design things by batle of each of some companis .
One company puroduces a low plice , other company puroduce a expensive price , but it has especially things .

In conclusion , advertisement need for us to grow up , enjoy from select .
if it were good thing , it could sell more and more .
So charactristic is most important thing .
"
7829,1203095.txt,P4,ZHO,low,"I agree with this statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
This seems to make sensens to comercial , because they try to persueing better profit from doing it , I am going to make some points to analize it .

First , the better advertisements can deliver a good perspection to consumer , make them believe that this is the right product for them , and to have this item will benifit either thire everyday life or promote thire health , for the company knows that people seeking better by nature .

Additionally , by over describe the item , make the custumer can not resist the merits of the product , in turn they can sell thire item high in quantities and can make more profir from it .

Forethemore , in ths way the company may raise thire reputation by telling people that they are the best one who can provide the public the best thing which are the one that the customer need , and once the company suceessfully gain the reputation , it is more easy for them to do the comercial in the future , for examlpe , the Ford automabile company is not recognized by consumer , by doing advertisement , to introduce thire car charastistic which are very functional which meet the need that people expected , such as the entertainment founction , the power of the engine , as thire statment been recognized by public , they reach thire goal : to make profit .

All in all , I would say that the advertisement make products seem much better than they really are are understandable , the question is that how the consumer to distiguish the real quality with what the information they get from the comany , the consumer need make desision that what stuff is they really need .

778,124603.txt,P8,TUR,high,"In these modern days , every each person wants to be successful .
I do n't know if they want it because of surviving or just for their egos .
I recognized that there are really much more people are becoming successful .
why ?
I think they are doing the right things that they already know how to do well .
There are reasons but first , people can start what they want to do with experience and second , sometimes taking risk can cause to go deep and fail so people would n't have a chance to get things well .

I think experience is the most important issue .
For example my mother always tells me to wear socks but I never do it until I have got a really painful stomachache !
And I always tell my mother not to warn me about anything because when bad things happened to me I understand well .
there 's another example that , my father is a pharmasist and I want to be a pharmasist too .
why do I want it ?
it 's all about my father 's experiences .
he knows everything about pharmact so I can use his knownledge .
I see my father is working and I know how he does it .
I do n't want to be a teacher or engineer while I have already have my father as a pharmasist .

Sometimes people want to take risks but trying new things is not safe at all .
If they want to have a business they have to think about first and they should get informations or help from the people who have experience already .
I think this is such a mindless thing !

Being a successful person is not so easy like leaving everything to chance .
Sometimes people need to be excited , and taking risk is a exciting thing but it may not brings luck .
If people want to survive and have a good life they need to be successful so they must do everything well .
I 'm sure if they have experience they would be lucky because they would make their life easy .

Nobody can say if it is true or false but some arguments permit to support that this statment is not a fatality .

Given that gas is more and more expensive , we can infer that people are going to reduce their consumption by walking , taking bus or using cycles .
This fact can contribute to reduce the number of car buyers , in the short term .
Indeed , people choose to make economies by keeping their car .

7277,1139910.txt,P7,ZHO,high,"In the recent years , many educators , parents and students have discussed how the students learn more efficiently and effectively .
There are two different philosophy that has been proposed in this hot topic .
One is to understand ideas and concepts and another one is to learn facts .

Most western countries like United States and Canada , the teachers encourage the students to understand ideas and concepts first .
The teaching approach is not bound to the fact that the students do not urge to remember a lot of information and facts from the textbooks .
For example , the teachers try to use some daily examples to explain some concepts in science such as physics , chemistry and biology .
At the same time , the students can develop their own creative , innovative and troubleshooting ability .
Meanwhile , it is good for the students to be capable of brainstorming in this very competitive communities .

In the other hand , most eastern countries such as China , Japan and so , the teachers prefer to ask the students to remember a lot of facts and information so as to build up their fundamental basis on their study .
However , most of the students cannot advocate their interest in their study .
In addition , the students are not willing to accept more new concepts or they are not able to develop any novel ideas in their study .
For example , the students are good at memory , but not on any innovation or troubleshooting issues in their living either .
Thus , it is not an effective and flexible way for them to deal with the difficulties and hurdles that they really face in the reality .

To be concluded , I totally agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
This approach would be more beneficial to the students in order to encounter and survive in this competitive world .

10322,1679077.txt,P1,TEL,high,"The issue at hand is whether broad knowledge on many subjects is bettar than specialization in one specific subject .
The issue is important because specialization on a specific subject is a major aspect for students during thier graduation and higher studies .
In my opinion to specialize on a particular subject is much better than to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .

Firstly , if the student specializes on a specific subject , he will be focussed and concentrated in his field of study .
Trying to have knowledge of all academic studies might overburden the student and it might leave him in disarray and in a choatic condition .
Sometimes it may lead to serious consequences of getting very low grades .
Furthermore a subject will have lot of topics related to it .
So a specializtion on such a topic will give an entire knowledge of that subject to the student .
He is definetely going to master the entire subject .

Specialization on a particular topic will lead to research , as many thing are yet to be unravelled in this world .
If the student pays specific attention to the specialization subject in case of higher studies like post graduation , he may face new problem in that subject and result in research related activities which is very good .
Take for example if no one tries to pay particuler attention on a specific field , there might have been no inventions and discoveries by the scientists .
If Einstein had not paid specific attention to his specialization subject of physics , there would have been no development because all human creations of this date are based on his many thoeries like three laws of motion , theory of relativity , quantum physics etc .

Finally I want to conclude by supporting that specialization ona specific sunject is much better than having knowledge of many academic subjects .
As the saying goes `` Jack of all trades master of none '' ; a student focussed on specific subject will be called a master of specific subject .
So students should be advised right from their secondary schooling to pay particular attention on subjects they are intrested in and go for higher studies .

I disagree with this statement .
In my opinion , travelling on one 's own is a better choice instead .
I can conveniently plan my schedule , use my budget more efficiently , and most importantly , learn about the history of the country that I visit .

Firstly , travelling alone means that I can have a flexible travel plan .
I can book my own air tickets , reserve my own hotel room , and decide when to visit places .
But when I am on my own , I do not have to worry about the needs of the others .
I can choose my time to buy a cheaper air ticket , and rent hotels that appeals to me most .
I also do not have to visit places that I am not interested in .

Secondly , I can use my budget more efficiently .
If I am to be led by a tour guide , I will have to pay .
The fee is usually very expensive and will account for a large part of my travel expenses .
And since the quality of the service provided by the tour guide is unreliable , I think it is a better idea to spend the money on the travel itself , instead of hiring a tour guide .
With more money , I can go to more scenic spots and attractions .
I can also afford to buy more souvenirs , and taste expensive cuisine .

Thirdly , I can fully explore the history of the country that I visit when I travel alone .
Tour guides only give superficial information about places , and they seldom tell us about the history .
All they care about catching the coach bus on time , and hurrying places after places .
When I travel alone , I can talk to the local people , and ask them about the local history .
This way , I can have a closer look on the historical background of the region , and learn more about its culture .

To conclude , I disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
I prefer travelling alone .
I can plan my own schedule , utilise my budget more efficiently , and learn about the history of the country that I visit .

Some of the youthfoul of today think they enjoy life alot more than older people .
This is because they are entering a new stage in their lives were independence and fulfillment rules thier chioces .
They feel they have all the power in the world and what is worst they feel inmortal .
However it is not this two factors or the overwhelment of emotions that will decide how they want to enjoy life at its fullest , it is their own attitude .

A girl that just finished highschool , has all her strength to enjoy the years to come and to achieve her goals , but what if she makes the wrong choices and decides to let her college education pass by and ends up working as a receptionist instead of that mechatronic engineer she wanted to be .

Her whole life was marked by this mediocre attitude .
Instead a girl who has her mind always on track and fights for what she wants , letting go of the common momentary human enjoyments and working towards a rewarding end , will find the obstacles on her road an enjoyment as she defeats them .

This same situation happens with older people .
They think that `` youthfoulness is uselessly spent on the youthfoul '' .
An old rich lawyer may often complain about her deteriorating situation an say that if she could turn back time they would do things differenty , make other choices or aim at higher goals .

The truth is that these inconformity is due , again , by the attitude and the wrong choices she displayed along her life .
On the other hand we also have men and wome who have faced maturity with a smile on their faces .
The experiences rich in their minds were achived thanks to their positive and proactive attitude towards life in general .
So , personally I do n't think that something you have no control of , such as age , can determine to what point you enjoy life .
Life may be enjoyed by a sick 80 year old farmer as well as by a healthy 17 year old waiting at the doors of destiny .

We define how to enjoy life and what it has to offer with our character .

The ideas and concepts are actually came into existence after many researches and debates on them .
It appears many ideas proposed for a fact but after numerous academic discussions , some of them achieve while others are eliminated .
These strong ideas help the student to see and invertigate in a different manner from who is only know the fact and applies it .

The learning of ideas behind the facts give the abilty to look at the fact in a different way which leads to improve it .
The ability to look for a different angle is up to those who know the underlying concepts and ideas .

In today 's fast life , as no one has time even for breakfast , and time for more competetion and hurry has come for everyone .

First , People use car for going different places such as schools , colleges , work places or any other place such as going for a trip with family or friends .
Going on a trip with family or friends is not possbile without car , we will not enjoy if we will not go by car .
If we will go by train or any other way , I think we will not enjoy our trip more .

Second , as competition is growing more and more between peoples of the same or different organization , they need to manage their time fastly and effectively so , they use cars and use of car can not be stop in the coming years .

486,87463.txt,P7,ARA,medium,"There are many aspects that are done on the the students to make them learn and tow essential ways that students follow and do while they are learning .
One way is understanding concept while the other is learning facts .
I agree that it is more important for students to got ideas and concepts than learning only the facts without understanding for many reasons like the believe of the subject and aquiring the ability to apply the concepts with the understanding .

If student learn information without understand how it come , there would be apossibilty one day the information would be changed according to the weak understanding of its concepts .
For example , I know an old man who think that the earth is a sphere and he kept this information for many years .
After decades the man changes his mind since he saw prooves that the earth is a sphere even he believed in the past that it is not a sphere ! .
So the understanding of the concepts would make stronger believed than if the information was just learned to the students .

The ability of applying any thing that is in our mind will vary depending on the way that we got the information in it .
It woud not be easy for the students who just learn facts to apply them and imagin how the facts would work on the reality while it would be so easy for the students who know the concepts to deal with any topic regarding it and it would be enthosiastic for them to dael with it and apply it since they already konw where and why it came from .
For instance , there is tow students who want to do research on particular topic .
The one who know the reasons of the topic deal with the research perfectly with the other student does not .

In conclosion , understanding concepts is much more better than learning facts since the believe will be higher and the applying would be more when the student understand ideas and concepts .
I advise all the educational companied to show the facts to the student rather than only learning facts .

Why should enjoying life be based on age ?
Sure , young children have a lot of fun playing around and laughing about simple things and just enjoying mostly everything they do but I also know a lot of older people that still enjoy their life very much .
A good example are my grandparents .
They are almost 80 years old and are happier than ever .
They had to start working really hard when they were teenagers .
Both of them worked almost all the way up to their 65th birthdays .
They have 4 sons together , so you can imagine that it cost a lot of time and work to raise the children .
Now , the sons are adults and already have families themselves .
My grandparents are retired now , so their hard work life is over and they can just enjoy life .
Their usual day includes long walks through the Nature and spending a lot of time with friends and family .
They have a nice hobby : Bowling .
Every Thuesday afternoon they meet with other people at the same age in a bowling center near their house and just enjoy bowling and talking to good friends .
They often come over to my parents ' house on the weekends .
Sometimes the whole family , including all 4 sons and all their grandchildren meets there and we sit together and have coffee and cake .
My grandparents have so much they enjoy .
Last yaer they even made a lifelong dream of them come true , they went on a vacation to the swiss alps .

Facts are fact which can not be challenged or can never be changed .
I believe that learning facts is important but more importantly its the ideas and concepts generated in a students mind which are helpful for a successfully learning .
When a student grasps a concept clearly his able to apply his own brain and produce more impotant concepts which is absolutly non - replaceable by anyother thing .
I understand , knowing and learning facts is impotant but without a good understanding a students knowledge is crippled , he can not shape his own opinion and originate ideas on his own .
His knowledge will be fact based rather than good reasoning .

Its impotant that a student should devote time alone for himself for building and constructing his own ideas , as when he / she steps into the practical world , there one needs to face lot of practical hurdles where facts might not be of any use , take an example when a students grows to become a doctor and is challenged professionaly to deal with some medical issues urgently , I dont think in that situation he can use his / her factual knowledge , because facts will only satisfy his query about the ailment maybe but the treatment would be according to the patients behavior which he has to judge and analyse on his own .
Maybe the process is not same as it was there in the text book .

Also a conceptual knowledge always helps a student to progress and build and provide this world with new idea , it might be possible the possible source of information has any kind of discripencies which can only be resolved when cthe concept is clear .
Then only a student caqn question and probably will be able to look for an answer on his own rather than waiting for someone else to provide him / her with new set of facts and figures .

Sometimes it is a dilemma to say whether successful people try new things and take risks rrther than only doing what they already know how to do well .
As far as I am concerned , I agree that successful people usually try new things and take risks .
I will point out sepecificate reasons as follow :

The main reason I advocate is that the new things and risks promote people work hard .
There is no deny that the new things and risks contains a lot of challenge , we do not know what will happen , what we will face , what result is , as if when we climd a mountain , we do not whether there are huge animals waiting fo us .
This condition inspire us be more carefull , more hard , whithout any careless .

What is worth noticing fact that when we try new things and take risks , we will get more experience .
Because the stuff is new and fresh to us , we have no experience to solve it .
As a result , we have to search new way to settle it according to the knowalage we have learned before , then gather the information to solve it one step by one step .
After this process , we get the new experience .
If we just do the things we already know howw to do well , we only have the way to solve this problem .
Successful carry ot a new way to settle question , this is the reason why they are successful

The future reason I state is that successful people are particular group in the society .
How to be successful people .
Not only do everything well , but also can give suggestion to other people .
Maybe other people can also doo the things well which we have know how to do it , but may can not try new thing or be afraid od taking risks .
Only brave man can be called successful .

To be fair , I must own up to the advantage of doing things what people have known how to do it , such as saving a lot of time , more steady .
But based on the reasons I have mentioned above , I agree that the successful people are who always try new thing and take risks .

5148,895470.txt,P3,KOR,medium,"It discussed that these days , the youth do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I agree with the statement .
Compared to past , yougn people do not have enough time to help their communities .
It is partly due to change of social envrionments .
This esay will discuss two reasons why young people do not give enough time to helping their communities in based on social changes .

First of all , living costs are getting higher than past .
Consequently , young people have to work hard and improve their skills .
For example , in last 50 years , buying a house is not cost alot compared to nowadays .
They do not try to make more money to buy a house but they also want to spend money for their entertaintments .
Most of young people enjoy traveling around country or even overseas .
They take more time to having hobby or enjoy their life .
Moreover , they also improve their knowledge wich is quite related to their job such as computer skills or learning other language in their spare time .
They do not have choice to work hard to living well and a society requires the ablilities from young people .

Secondly , young people do not concern their communities unlike past .
It is because that the social envrionments are changed .
In the past , members of community spend time with their neighbers like a big family .
It is because that they work together to farming or work in the smae company .
However , these days young people are more concerns about themselves than their communities .
They do not go to the same company or even same school .
Developing of communication technologies make possible to communicate with many people including living in distant area .
Ironically , due to the developed technologies such as Internet or video games which most of young people like those people lose time to interact with members of communities .
They can call them or meet up on Internet .
Because of this social mood , young people do not take care about communities .

In conclusion , young people do not give enough time to helping their communities due to .
However , it is not only fault of young people .
It is because of the social changes .
The living costs are rapidly increasing and social moods are changed to care about more individual issues .
In my personal oppnion of this , local communities should try to bring more concern from the young people to help their communities .

Most people may diagree that because they think people will rely on cars more in the future than today .
However , I agree with the statement because I think the technology will create new transpotation tool to replace the car .
I will argue over my perspectives with the following reasons .

First of all , accoring to the insufficient of the petroleum , scitients are eager to device new tools to replace the cars .
Nowadays the oil resources become a searious problem all over the world .
Since the resource are limited , humans can not use it without restriction .
However , people are too late to get aware of that , so the price of oil starting soaring up and it might cause the third world war .
In order to avoid the energy problem become the trigger of the war , every countries will decrease the use of cars .

Secondly , people in the future will develope a more efficent and rapid transportation tool which can replace cars .
Although it only happens in the movie now , the future people will fly in the sky , I still believe it can come true under the scientists endeavor .
People become more and more lazy and the ground get crowder than before , without any space to extend , it seems to reansonable to enlarge people 's living to the sky .
In addition , fly can save more time and also solve traffic problems happens now .
However , this need the technology to reach the goal and I expect that .

To sum up , although cars are main tool that people depend on , with the overuse of cars , there are a lot of peoblems emerging .
In order to release ourselves from vicious circle , human beings will initiate one new thing to help us attain the same goal .
In other words , people is going to invent air-transpoted tools to declin the number of cars .

Humana have achived a great deal of development in each erasin own filed and that cause the miscommunication to each each other becaus the concpt are now reaaly hard to under stand easily .
So , word ` generalist ' and appeard instead od ` specialist ' contemporary society .
by make conncetion in spacial academic fileds they colud play a team work in various projects .

Furthermore , having a broad information can make a `` sinerge effect '' in a specific era .
If the knoweldge intergated with others , the benefits are not only double but triples , even increase inormously , and this ih the reason why trem `` sinerge effect. '' maked .
for that reason , many university is makig a joing coures for their reacherch as a ` inter-displinary ' purpose , and thorgh those kind of effort current stuy are gaining a great deal of accomplishments .
For exem \ mple As a graduate student , I am undergiong that method too .

On the whole , broad knoweldge can make more fluent social communications and make each specific subjects more power by connecting .
That makes cleare that it 's better to choose than a specific subject learing .

9417,1510608.txt,P8,SPA,low,"I really agree with this statement , in life the people who try to discover new things taking risk have one motivation to still becomen better every day , is like a kind of auto motivation .
For example in a Medica Doctor student , the professors has a study plan , but if the student limite to follow that plan he will only adquire the minimal information to become a doctor , but he do not will have the hability to success from over the other students so , the professional doctors not notice him presence to ask him to mbecome a part of their team member .

People need to take risk , try different things , need to look not only that they have in front , they have to explore the world and improve new technology with this kind of activitis they will success more than others that only do that they know how to do well , they never become a greater person , at work they never grow up , they will be confined to their sites for their lifetime .

An example of a success person who take risks and to more could be Bill Gates , he was a simple and normal student that love the computers but one day he has a dream , he begin to contact people , he do things , he promote his product and now , he is one of the most successful persons in world , because they dont want to do every day only things that he know well how to do , he want to improve new things , and he did it

So in conclusion it is pretty obvious that the people who do more that they suppose to do , become much more successful that the people that only do what they already know how to do , and for this I invite to everyone to do more everyday , do all that you want to do , explore the world , enjoy the life , and success .

1575,265309.txt,P1,ITA,low,"I 'm convinced that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to specializing in just one specific subject .
There are several reasons why I agree with this previous statement .

First of all , having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects allow us having a personal culture .
The school give to the students the capacity of studing a substantial number of subjects , so it 's important having a knowledge of them for ourself , as a culture for being well prepared in general .
Because I think that knowing differents subjects open more our mind than just focus in one specific subject .
In fact knowing just a specific subject is like a limitation .

Second , the knolwedge of many academic subjects give the chance to have more chance in our life .
Indeed , knowing a vast amount of informations show your potential with other people .
You are prepared and have what it takes to be considered as an efficient person .
Occasions in life can occur , because you are prepared in many subject so in a future you could do several works .

To sum up , I think that many reasons exist why knowing many object is better than just one

1031,168968.txt,P3,FRA,high,"What is really being young nowdays ?
We often talk of the problems created by young people beaking the law and respecting nothing and no one in the suburbs .
But it is not the majority of young people .
We talk less about quiet young people just trying to do their best in life and who do help their community .
This leads to the last point , even for the ones willing to help , it is not always easy to do so .
They lack opportunity and time .

When we heard about young people nowdays , what do we hear ?
We hear about the laws that were broken , the policemen that were attacked , the cars that were burnt .
Of course it is a part of the problem but as it is often the case , the worse aspect is very well known and many people tend to forget that it concerns only a minority .
So we should focus on the majority of young people , the one we rarely hear of .

In universities or graduate schools , there are clubs or groups .
These are about music , theater , art , sport , games but many concern the help that can be given by students .
For example , in the school I went to , there was at least a dozen of such clubs .
Some students gave lessons to children , some got toys for poor children , some spent time to give food to poor people and some even went to India to build a school .
These clubs were among the most popular ones as many students thought it was normal to give an afternoon per week helping those who needed it .

The last point I would like to develop is that , even it is always possible to say that the young ones do not help their communities enough , it is not always a question of lack of good will .
When you are young , you are explained that you have many responsabilities , a huge number of things to do in order to prepare your future life .
All these problems , that might seem easy to solve afterwards , are difficult to face when you are young and without experience .
They often leave little time available or no strengh to face something else .

The conclusion could be that young people 's reputation suffers from what is being said about a minority of them and that the other most certainly do what they can , even if it might not always be enough .

7371,1147775.txt,P5,TEL,high,"A world with fewer cars !
Sounds preposterous now .
But I think this is going to be a reality in twenty years from today .
There are various reasons why I hold this opinion .
These include population growth , fuel crisis , and popular consciouness about environment .

The population of the world is only growing by the day .
Naturally , we would expect more cars to roll on the roads .
But , we do not realise that land is not growing in proportion to people .
With limited land , there will come a time when we will not be able to find more space for our cars .
Then the recourse is mass rapid transport system , which discourage car-use .
This has already been seen in Delhi , India 's capital city where Delhi Metro Rail system has been created to deal with the stress that increasing vehicular population was creating .
Now , we see that the number of cars have indeed come down on the roads because people find it more convenient to take a train to office , at a negligibel price , rather than maintain an own car .

Another reason why the number of cars might go down is the shortage of fuel .
Oil crisis is here for real .
It is becoming increasingly difficult to satisfy the energy need of the world .
Very soon , the prices of oil are going to increase very highly .
Early signs can already be seen .
In such a case , running a car can be very expensive .
Research on alternative fuels , like biofuels or solar power , is still in nascent stage .
Thus , it will be very difficult for the common man buy fuel for his car .
In India , the price of petrol has been increasing steadily and my family now goes out in car , only when it is really necessary or when all the four of us have to go out together .
Otherwise , we use bikes or , simply , the public transport system .

The last reason why I think that cars are going to be fewer is popular sentiment against environmental pollution .
Cars use fuel which increases environmental pollution .
Therefore , some countries , like those in the Nordic region , encourage their citizens to use bicycles which are more eco-friendly .
They are also a healthier option in comparison to cars as they keep the rider fit .
Thus , concious citizens support such ideas .
This trend seems to be catching up , which makes me believe that it will in future become very popular .
In that case , the prospects for cars look bleak .

To conclude , I believe that cars are going to become rarer in the years to come because of a variety of factors .
These include shortage of two resources : land and oil .
These are going to be scarce because of growing population , in which case cars will not be viable .
Finally , when people become more eco-friendly , they would look for options other than cars , which will affect the prospects of these automobiles .

3566,620203.txt,P7,TUR,medium,"As a student i suppose that it is much useful to understand and learn ideas and to demonstrate on the ideas .
I believe the most important thing that shows if the student understood and learned something is that if a student can put his thought to the thing he learned .
The education i am having now also teaches me how to think and how to express my thoughts on certain topics and fact .
The most certain example is when a student can express his or her opinion on history ; because history had happened in past and a student can change the history by his/her thoughts .
For example if a war is lost and we know how it 's lost , a student can think of what he would do if it was him and how his movement towards things would be in that moment .
If a student can express his thoughts of movement to somebody else i would believe that a student not just learned the facts also understood what happened in the past .
He also learned it and would never forget it because he actually lived those moments in his mind .
This is very important in understanding ideas or things happen .
Student must be interrfierd with the topic .
Another example is that student can learn a bunch formulas in math in a lesson and by using those formulas he can solve every question .
But after a while if that student does n't go back and study the formulas he will forget them .
What happened is student leanred the formulas at that moment but he actually did n't understand them .
So learning also becomes with going back and studying the things that are learned .
Revision is very important in a students life .
In our country most people work before 2 days from the exam and they memorize everything then they get an `` A '' on the exam .
But after graduation there is this big exam OSS and they ca n't memorize everything because they are judged on what they have learned in the past 5 years so they fail from OSS and they ca n't go to a university .
What happens to the things they understood at the time does n't become useful in their future and they ca n't be successful because their education did n't make them learned anything .
As a matter of fact not only understanding is important , but learning and understanding is much more improtant than only understanding .

2240,386725.txt,P6,TEL,high,"I agree that travelling in a group led by a tour guide is beneficial in a number of ways but with a few reservations on group travel .
I would explain my reasoning in the following paragraphs .

Firstly , Tour guide is a professional who knows alot of places , thier history and how to reach the place , where to stay , what food to eat etc . , .
Also Tour guide is proficient in the native language of the place .
These two advantages overwiegh any other disadvantages of travelling .

Secondly , travelling in a group led by a tour guide will be cost effective as more people will share the travel expenses .
Tour guide will explain the history of the place visited which we cannot know unless we do some homework on what places to visit and read through its history which we often donot do .
Travelling in a group will help to build new partnerships with fellow travellers in the group which cannot be done if travelled indivdiually .

Thirdly , travelling in a group with a guide helps us to avoid problems with native language speakers and also fishy shopping tricks by native speakers .
Also as a group , more number of places can be toured with same amount of money if spent on individual travel .

But , there are a few disadvantages for group travel led by a guide .
Limited knowledge of the tour guide will make us to tour fewer places which tour guide is familiar with .
Co-ordination effort among the group of people with different mindsets is difficult .
Privacy during travel will be be voilated during group travel .
Travelling individually allows the individual to see places of his/her interest rather than constrained by the group travel .

In Conclusion , Group travel is advantageous in most of the scenarios in many terms but it depends on the individual preference and his/her fnancial limitations .

1809,312667.txt,P2,TEL,high,"I completely agree with the statement `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
Younger people enjoy their life more than older people because of the fact that they have to take care of lesser responsbilities than the older ones do .

Younger people need not worry much about their future they need to worry mostly about their subjects , while the older people have to worry about a lot of things ranging from tensions in the office to what to cook tonight .
Younger people enjoy life with their friends they go out for parties and clubs with their friends more frequently then the older ones do , even though older ones go out to party their mind is always preoccupied by tensions .

For older people the burdens keep on increasing day by day and they find little time to enjoy , but for youngsters every second is for enjoyment and they enjoy their nlife to the fullest .
Older people also have the problem of taking care of their children .
Older people also are worried about their future the time after they retire .
Younger people also have the privelage of being taken care of by their parents whenever they have a problem and need not have any worries .
Younger people have the privelege of a number of holidays when they have plenty of time to enjoy their life .

Though most of the younger people enjoy their life more then the older ones there are older people who enjoy life more then the younger ones do , for example Dr. Vijay Mallya who enjoys his life more than any youngster does .

I feel that younger people enjoy more than older people do because they have lesser burdens than the older ones .
They have the privelage of being taken care of by their parents and need not worry much but only have to enjoy .

If you want to sail in two boats you are sure to fall .
There many advantages to this belief .
such as a person has will remmember that easily ,, concentrate in it , he can manage it with ease .

Firstly he can remmember the specialized subject .
The other way to say this statement would be he would not forget easily .
As there is only subject to learn .
He can learn it more thouroghly in depth .
For example if a person is learning three classes for three languages i.e he is learning french , chineese , Spanish .
And a person learning only Spanish this person will be able learn spanish more rapidly and the other person will not only get confused with all three languages to learn he will also forget it very soon

Secondly He can concentrate on one single subject .
As there is only one subject to read he can concentrate on and gain expertise in it get a good job with a fat salaryhave ever heard of a person doing PHD in more than one suject at time i no you havent heard .

Thirdly if can management will be easier .
if forexample if campany like Micrsoft starts producing Shoes , grocery items they will have lots of difficulties in managing their productline this may causes huge losses .
This means that Microsoft should concentrate only in Software business which he is the leader .
This Will make their company to prosper m

I agree and disagree with that statement because sometimes you can see an old person is enjoying his \ her life and that depend on his feelings , money , health , and thinking about how he \ she is going to spend the rest of her life either in joy or sad .

There are alot of people who enjoy life in different way , i mean that each person has his own and different way to enjoy life .
sometimes you can see old persons who enjoy life more than a young person and sometimes you can find young persons who enjoy life more than old persons and as i said joyness in life differs in each one and also it depends on the persons feeling , money , health , and his way of thinking .

you can see alot of young people who suffer in life and wish to die , thats because of lack of one of the four things i mentioned above , and sometimes you can see alot of young people who enjoy life because they are still young and being old is still far away from there life and that they must spend each second of his life happely and joyfully .
Sometimes you can see old persons who suffer in life and that is 70 % of them and thats because they are afraid from death or they feel that they are too old and cannot handle and do anything and they want other people to take care of them like small childrens , but still we can find old people who are happey and they enjoy there life alot because its the end of there life and they have to pass every minute happy and that will cause the old persons to live longer .

In my opinion the statement could be both agreed and disagreed as i mentioned above and joyness and happiness can be made by the person him \ her self .

10928,1788085.txt,P6,JPN,high,"I personally do not think that the travel in a tour with a guide is preferrable for several reasons .
Instead , I suggest the travel alone as a best way .
This essay compares and contrasts the advantages and disadvantages of travelling alone and in a group led by a tour guide .

First of all , a tour led by a guide requires a set schedule : tourists cannot go around as they like ; instead , they exclusively have to follow the guide all the day .
By contrast , travelling alone permits a person much freedom : she or he can decide the schedule of that day according to her or his will .

Second , although the existence of a guide might seem to be helpful , it sometimes does not function so .
For example , at the tourist site , the guide gives an explanation to it , and tourists just listen to the guide .
This form of information-acquring is just passive .
Instead , I prefer learning things by myself actively , and I think this is the major advantage of travelling alone because the knowledge or memory acquired by positive attitude should be better than memory got by passive attitude .

Third , the guided tour might not allow people to take a closer look at tourist sites or monuments .
Since there is a certain number of people in the group , it is hard to estimate that an individual can have a closer look at tourist features until he or she gets satisfied .
This is precisely due to the set schedule as indicated .
People have to go around the one place to another in a rush in order to make it on time .
Again , on the contrary , sicne traveling alone allows much freedom , a traveler can take a closer look on the site or tourist features .

Having said that though , travelling in a group led by a guide does have some advantages such as : some interaction and socialised relationship amongst other members of the group ; safety because they travel with other people .

However , as far as the first advantage of travelling in a group is concerned , it is still achievable even if it is a travel by alone .
Being open , friendly and social enables the traveller to have the interaction with other people along the journey : even if s/he does not have any friends or fellows at the beginning , s/he can acquire them through the trip , and this is the exactly exciting point of travelling alone .

As far as the security issue is concerned , the advantage seems to rest upon travelling alone .
Yet , considering other aspects , as argued , travelling alone should be still entitled to be a desirable way of the journey overall .

205,35820.txt,P3,KOR,medium,"It is generally belived that the young people in today are less interested in their neighbor than previously .
Althogh some young people still spent their time on helping their communities , in my opinion young people do n't enjoy their time spend with their communities no more because of development of technology and competitive education .

Above all , the development of technology brings about the indivisualism .
In other words , because each person has amusment things such as the TV , computer , P2P in each home , people do n't need people whom we enjoy time with becasue people can enjoy enough their time using this eqpuipment .
For example , when I was in secondary school , I would rather spend the time on playing game by computer than playing game with my friend in playground or house .
Thus , such a indivisualism allows people concentrate on just oneself , thereby making people spend more time in their house and not giving enough time to helping their communities .

Moreover , the competitive education make young people not helping their communities .
In particular , today 's educaion enable baby go to the private academy to become more smart children .
In this process , young children believe that more important things in success life is concentrating on myself not others .
For instance , parents prefer to their children to concentrate on only study than help other people .
Therfore , because such a competitive education not allow children spend their time on things except study , young people do n't have any chance to help other people .

In conclusion , I agree with this statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their local neighbor any more for the reasons that I mentioned above .
Not only High level indivisualism but also competitive education makes young people not be able to spend their time on helping their communities .

now a days price fare for the airline tickets too have gone down .
its become cheaper and now a days ther are many flights going daily internationly as well as domestic .
like recently i visted madras my family prefered going by plane because it saves time and ther was hardly differance in the cost .
now a days only peole are not having time for their personal comitments and that mens are replaced by machinery .

11182,1832138.txt,P8,ZHO,medium,"I agree successful people love to try new things and take risks rether than only doing what they already know how to do well .
there are few reasons that i support .

First , I think to be a successful person whose personality must be interest in anything .
They like ti take adventatures and to do a lot of new things that are general people do n't want to do it .
For example .
my father is a successful businessman .
He was born in a very small town in Taiwan .
In his family , there are no body want to go to big city to find a job .
Everyone is satisified with their life , thay do n't want to change their life styles .
Even thought they know to stay in the country ca n't be rich , but they still love to stay in the country .
My father is different with other people .
He knows if he work hard and know more about information from world , it must be help to his future and career .
Whatever how hard work , he always wants to try and he never afraid of challanges .
Because he knows that may be a good chance to change his life .
And now he did it .

Second , I think if you never try new things , you wo n't know how will be change in your world .
If you want a successful life , you have to try everything .
To find every possible successful reason and do n't be afraid of to make mistakes .
Because any mistakes can make you find out what 's problem in this situation and improve your ability .

I believe to be a successful person needs to spend more time to do a lot of things and it must have a hard time to overcome .
But one day when you become a successful person , you will know everything is worth .

At first glance majority of people will feel that the young people do n't enjoy life more than older people but if the matter is taken more seriously then people will realise that that 's not the case .

Young people have the advantage of being young .
Age is one thing that 's in their favor .
Even the older people in their younger days would have enjoyed life more then what they are enjoying now .
I feel that health is an issue to be taken into consideration .
Most of the young people maintain better health then the older people and hence they can enjoy more .
I say this because I feel that it 's not possible to worry about health issues and enjoy life at the same time .

I feel that young people enjoy more then older people because with age comes responsibility .
As compared to the older people young people do n't have much responsibility .
Young people do n't have to think of family and jobs whereas older people have to do that .

Stress is another factor that should be taken into consideration .
According to me older people are more stressed then younger people and that affects their overall outlook of life .
I feel that a person without stress tends to enjoy life more then a person under stress .

I also feel that young people have more options to enjoy .
I say this because I feel that health does n't really permit old people to take part in various activities like sports .

So looking at the points mentioned above I am confident to say that young people enjoy life more then older people and among the various points mentioned above I feel that 's health is something thatreally against the older people is their heath .

Some years ago i was in Spain for a trip with my four friends , and with them I went all spain alog by car .

Another aspect where the cars or simila meands of transport are necessary is to solve the important logistic problems like the transport medicines , illness people or for emergency cases like a fire disasters .

7343,1145444.txt,P4,ZHO,high,"Are most advertisements can make products more attrctive and better when they are advertised ?
To some extent , I agree with the author 's general assertion that some advertisements do have some positive effects on consumers ' impressions on products but only through advertising cannot necessarily make products seem much better .
However , the author unnecessarily extends this broad assertion to an irreversible extreme while overlooks some essential factors .
On balance , My points of contention involve the fundamental and deep analysis as discussed below .

On the one hand , I would like to admit that the author 's statement , although suffers from some obivous drawbacks , has some merits primarily in some special cases in which the implicit rationale behind it accords with common sense and our experiences in daily life .
Hence , it is partially correct .
In the first place , I want to point out that advertisements can have positive effects on consumers ' recognition of certain product .
Since clients tend to accept the fact that only firms producing superior products will advertise their products because only those firms can make ends meet or even profit greatly through advertising .
It is true that marketing a product through advertising means investing a lot of money and a firm cannot know in advance whether these advertisements will be useful to the success of a product .
Hence , advertising is a high-risk investment and only big firms are appealed to advertise their products .
For instance , Microsoft Co. or Coca Cola Co. often advertise their new products through all types of media .
This phenomenon makes consumers think that advertised products are good in quality , however , which is often not the case .

Further more , advertisements tend to overstate the quality of a product .
Some words used in advertisements will elaborate the attractiveness of a product and will be unwillingly to admit the defects of a product .
Consequently , consumers who watch advertisements will aptly think that the product described in the advertisement is very good in quality although in reality this product is not so good .

On the other hand , recognizing that a more applicable should incorporate different aspects of the issue as sufficient as possible , I have to point out that the author overlooks some compelling factors that may affect this issue .
In short , this statement is problematic in some ways .
For example , some products do have the same quality as presented in advertisements .

In conclusion , issue of whether advertisements make products seem much more superior than they really are is a complex one , requiring subjective judgment .
Consequently , there are no easy or certain answers .
So different are the personal experiences and emotional concerns among people with diverse cultures that thousand individuals might hold thousand opinions .
According to me , some advertisements do have some positive effects on consumers ' impressions on products therefore can make these products more attractive .

9355,1496739.txt,P3,SPA,medium,"Since I lack of experiences in young people participation in other countries , let me focus the topic geographically .
In Colombia , young people involving into their communities is quite common .
But , it is specially clear to see in low classes people .

This phenomena is not present in high classes youngs , as it is in low classes youngs .
My opinion is , I think the youngs who participate helping their community and contributing to its development are people who see that in their community something is missing and the think , they feel , they can do something in order to improve some life conditions .
For instance , a boy who likes playing football goes every weekend to the field .
Once he sees it without grass , it can be that he encourages other people playing with him to do something for improve this situation .
Then , they can collect some money from neighbors and buy the grass and fix a date to plant the grass and this way the may have a better field .

On the other hand , high class young people are not in touch with problems , because most of the times they are already solved by their parents .
So they do not feel the need to fix something because everything around them is fixed .
Besides , their priorities lie on studies , parties and some other aspects of life that do not include their communities .
Also , somehow their good economical situation makes them more individual , losing in some way the communitiy sense .
Taking the same example like above , a rich boy goes playing football in the social club , where his parents have some share .
This club will have for sure an excellent field with recently cutted , soft grass .
So this boy will not worry about grass .
He probably will worry about wether he will use the sauna or not , and if he will go to the pool with their colleagues after the game .

The situation illustrated is a common example of everyday life and a different way to see it depending on the observer .
For people who likes to participate , community sense is very important .
People who do not , simply do not mind .

7368,1147714.txt,P5,TUR,medium,"It is now the year 2006 .
When today is compared with 20 years ago , it is easily seen that things have changed a lot .
Nothing remained the same but technology changed more than anything else .

When car was first invented , a developed countries president made a comment about the cars .
He said that it was an unnecessary invention and people would not like travelling in it .
They would surely be bored of driving it one day and would return back to the horses they were riding before .
But his comment never come true .
It is clear that he does not like inventions but most people like .

Since technology is getting more advanced day by day , it is not hard to guess that something that will be more useful than the cars will be invented soon .
Maybe in 20 years people will not be driving cars .
I strongly believe that in 20 years a mixture of a plane and car will be produced .
So people will not drive on the earth anymore .

This new invention will be good for everyone .
Since there will be no cars on the earth , there will be no traffic jam and since our `` plane-cars '' will be in the sky there wo n't be any accidents because there will be plenty of emptiness in the sky .
Also this invention will be closer to the sun .
So it will work with sun energy .
As you see there will be no need of gasoline .
People will not have to have a budget for gasoline because their car will work with only sunlight and it will be free !
Also if it is night and there is no sun , it will work with moon light .

The idea of a `` Plane-car '' is just a dream for now but it sounds good .
Maybe it looks like a real fantasy , which is impossible to occur but we should keep in mind that some time ago many technological devices that we use now looked impossible , too .

10346,1685228.txt,P3,ZHO,medium,"Do people nowaday give enogh time to help their comunities ?
I think that people nowaday have tired to give enough time to their communities .
There are several key reasons for my position .

First , people nowaday have work very hard to survive .
They do n't have much time for themselves , not mention about the time for communities .
Compared now to the fivety years ago in Taiwan , people had a lot of time for their communities because people mainly worked as a farmers .
For example , people have to work from 7 to 9 for their companies because the competions nowaday are so keen , however fiveteen years age people just needed to work 9 to 5 .
It is a industry world everywhere and people have to do their best to survive .
People have tried their best to give their leisure time to the communities .

Second , governments nowadays always take a lot efforts to helping the communities so that people do n't have to give too much time to the communities .
Goverments have already made plan to helping communities .
For examples , the government in Taiwan allocates human resources and money to every comminities to help children getting tutoring after schools for free .
There are also a lot policies the goverment paying efforts to help the communities , such as local security durinf nights , providing human resources to help people to solve their difficuties .
People do n't have to worry about that they do n't give enough time to their communities because governments has already took care for the need of the commnities .

Many people do n't disagree with me , stating that people nowadays do n't give enough time to the communities .
I think people nowaday have already spent enough time for their communities since they do n't have much time for theirselves and also government has also put much effort in the communities so that people do n't have to worry about it .
"
5904,1017153.txt,P3,DEU,high,"I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities , but I believe that this problem cannot be limited to young people but extends to older generations as well .

To begin with , from my experience , only few young people are involved in their communities .
Peer pressure , the fear of seeming ` uncool ' to their friends or just lack of interest might be the most common reasons .
This is a very sad development , I believe , since community work brings people of different backgrounds together .
Community work can , thus , contribute to strenthening people 's sense of responsibility and their open-mindedness .

Nevertheless , I do not believe that the problem is limited to young people .
Particlarly in larger cities , where life tends to be more anonymous , only few people dedicate time to the community .

I do not think , however , that this development is inevitable .
My experience is that you can get people involved if you are convinced of what you are doing and you can transport this excitement to others .
For example , I have been working in my university 's amnesty international group for four years now .
In our work we also regularly visit schools to tell students about what we do and to gain support for our group .
The students ' reactions are always very positive in that they are usually ready to help and support our work .

As a conclusion , in my view , this example shows that the problem will not be solved on its own .
In my opinion , the lack of sense of responsibility for the community is not only a problem among young people but extends to our society as a whole .
If we want younger and older people to get involved , we have a responsibility to offer opportunities and to be role-models .
Changes in society are hard to achieve .
We should nonetheless make an effort - every single one of us .

8692,1368416.txt,P8,ARA,high,"To gain a successful life is a very dificult step to take and trying new things and taking a risk is a harsh step to go down .
If someone is successful in something then he should keep attached to it and doesnt risk for trying something new and loosing all his great knowledge .

success is everywhere and it requires a lot of competition so if anyone is'nt willing to be very strongly related to what he knows the most and risks his success someone else might take his place even if he is'nt better .
Being successful is also being smart and wise .
If you are not wise then you might destroy what you built for taking a risk that you might fail .

My cousin , who graduated from one of the best canadian universities , was employed at on of the most popular and famous pharmicies in canada and he was payed applicaple wages which made him have a comfortable life .
Although my cousin was very smart he was n't that wise , he surprisingly decided to leave the pharmacy 's work and find another work in a drug company .
When he submited the information the company needed they did'nt accept him and ofcourse the pharmicy found a new employee to take his place .
Although my cousin had a great successful life and was a promoted employee he lost every thing just for taking a small risk .

If someone is already successful why not continuing in his major instead of taking a risk that might not be gainful ?
Greed is sometimes what makes successful people fall behind , whenever they have something they look for more and this is what makes some people fall in the harsh circumstances of a such a change .

losing all what you built is a great lose so not taking such a risk is a better decision .

Those items sometimes betray people and do not work as much as it says on the advertisement , though it is customers responsibility to choose and purchase what they want , and business companies have right to do so .

First , as I mentioned before , it is customers responsibility to choose and purchase what they want .
If they do not want to try , they really do not have to .
If customers want to know how well it works , they can ask the opinions from someone who had used the products before purchasing it .

Furthermore , advertisement is crutial to business world to attract customers and increase the number of purchase .
If they fail , they will not compete other rival companies , which making the similar products .
In my own experience , during political science , my partner and I had to run for president and vice president .
We had to made twenty plans we will do if we were elected .
To attract other students in the class , we had to make up nice plans that are obviously impossible if we were really running for presidency in real life .

In conclusion , I agree to the idea of making advertisements which make products seem much better than they really are .
Afterward it is the customers ' responsibility to choose what they want , and the business world has the right reason to do what they are doing now to survive .

11138,1825550.txt,P5,FRA,high,"During the twentieh century , cars have been in the very heart of the occidental society .
Since the early 1920's , the number of individual vehicles had increased sharply .
But today , many question themselves about the future of this kind of transportation .
Will there be fewer cars in twenty years than there are today ?
I believe there will , for three main reasons : firstly because of a ressources run out , secondly because of environmental considerations , and eventually for pratical , technical reasons due to the amount of space left .

I would start by pointing out a problem which is widespoken about in the media in these days , that is to say the lack of gas ressources .
A recent study showed that if the Chinese had as many cars as the average American , these Chinese cars will consume all the gas production on earth .
That underlines a serious problem : there is not enough gas on this planet to allow everybody to have one 's own car .
And this , I think , prevents cars from being this century 's personal transportation .
Even though it has been tried to build cars running on hydrogen , the tests that were made have shown it would be much more expensive , much more dangerous , and much less efficient than gas .
The lack of ressources is the first reason for which I believe there will be far fewer cars in twenty years .

Furthermore , cars running on gas have had a terrible effect on our planet 's environment for the last century .
People are slowly getting aware of that , even if it sometimes turns into real chestnuts , especially in French cities where 4x4 owners are told to be the main helpers of pollution , while there are plenty of other reasons .
Yet , it is a fact that cars pollute much , and that we are very unlikely to find a cleaner efficient ressource .

Finally , there is one very simple but crucial problem about cars , that is not as currently underlined as the lack of gas is : the lack of space .
Let 's say that each single person in Beijing , for instance , own one 's personal car .
What would happen ?
We all have in mind the images of Beijing 's , or Tokyo 's incredibly crowded streets .
How will how these people do to park their car , or even to get out milliom-car traffic jams with it ?
Shall we turn the whole world into a gigantic parking lot ?
This problem is already happening in developped countries 's largest cities , such as Tokyo and New-York City .
Let 's face it , it would be a disaster if everyone owns one 's car in less developped countries 's immense cities , let 's say New Delhi or Johannesburg , where the infrastructures will certainly be poor , according to these cities 's development .
In twenty years , th Earth will be crowded enough without any need for hundred-kilometer traffic jams .

By way of conclusion , I would say that cars are definetely not our future , and that one should concentrate on improving public transportation .

8503,1335394.txt,P8,JPN,medium,"It is true that many people succeed by only doing what they already know how to do well .
In fact , the artist or claftmen are successful people .
However , I do agree that if people try new things and take risks , they can be more successful in their lives .
Trying new things creats new inventions and technology and new experience .
Moreover , new things can solve problems in a society .

If people try new things and take risks , they can invent new technology .
Bill Gats is a good example .
His invention of microsoft made people 's life more convinient and easire .
He become a millionare becaue he tried new things and took risks .

If people try new things and take risks , they can have more new experience .
Moreover , the new experience is the key to be successful .
For example , one of my friend from Taiwan trid to come to Canda in order to get PHD dgree .
This was very new expericne for her and took risks because she had to leave her country and live by herself .
However , she become a famous resercher after she graduated from the university .

More importantly , whiout trying new things , many difficult problmes in this world wo n't be able to be solved .
If people can solve the probelms , they can be very halpful and successful .
For instance , the lack of energy is one of the social problems .
My boss at Universtiy has been studying about a fusion energy .
He and his co-wokers try to creat new energy for the future .
Even though his reserch has not complied , he is one of the famous scientists in the world .

In conclustion , many may belive that doing what people already know how to do well becomes more successful .
However , if people try new things , they can invent new products which are necesarry for many people .
Additionally , if poeple challenge new things and take risks , they can develop new experience .
This also made people successful .
Finally , as people try new things , they can solve many problems in the future .

the life of a student is full of surprising experiments that someone get to discover day after day .
there is nothing more interesting that being a simple student who has no responsabilty except just studying a little and spending all his free time getting to meet new friends , partying more often .
I remember when i was a young person , it was the best time of my life i had meet alot a friends , its true am still in contact with them till now but it is just not the same thing when we were young , we dont see each other more often like we use to do , every time we want to meet we have to schedule our meetings in advance , and even when we meet we dont have fun like we use to do .
Is it the age or what ?
Is it because where are old this is happening ?
we cannot stay up late anymore , we are thinking about collecting momey and the difficulties and responsabilities of life .

Another point to be mentioned is the health , i am an athlete , i enjoy doing sport , gathering with my friends around a soccer game , but unfornately i cannot do this anymore .
Every time i do a small effort i stop right away because i cannot continue .
It is all rekated to growing older and older and having alot of responsabilities .

Another thing to talk about it the house duties , shoping cleaning kisd demands , we have to do all of this over the weekend when we have a little of free time

The advertisement companies do this because it is their jobs to captivate the attentions of all human beings .
If they did make products seem better that they are we will live in a world full of boring and unuseful things .

For example , let 's stay on entire day in front of a television watching and analyzing commercials .
How many times people have seen a McDonald 's or a Burguer Kings commercial with a gigantitc , juicy , and the most fresh vegetables ever seen ?
Always .
Why ?
Becuase it attracts people , it makes people want and desire things the really do not want .
In myentire life have I eaten a burguer like I just explaines ?
No .
People often confuse reality with illusion .
Commercial ar specifically made to make people beleive they will find and eat the best burguer they have tasted in their lives .

Another example is the big boards in the middle of the roads .
Those big boards are made to catch , immediately the attention of the drivers and the passengers .
The big board are often filled with announcement of new clothing , a new alcoholic beverage , a concert , new kinds f foods , etc .
I thinks the best way to make products seem , a little more of what they are , by this method .
This methos is simple and acquirate , and will helps us catch the true glance , freshness , originality of the product .

As people know , we live and will always live in a world full of unrealistic and illusory advertisement in order to get people to want , buy , feel , taste the products they are announcing .

Firms try to get their make known so that we buy their product even if we do not need it .
People encharged on making advertisements try to create a need in people of the product his company sells .

Why do we need spensive clothes for example ?

8032,1242840.txt,P5,JPN,medium,"Since main energy source of motor vehicles are fossil resorces , as we can see those resorces are running out and also produce carbon dioxide while consumption , there is enormous pressure to avoid using automobiles and will be more .

Actually , number of new automobile sales is declining for last 5 years because of raise of gasoline price , further development of public transportation and low population growth rate .

However , I also see that investment on new technology and effort to invent new energy on motor vehicles are quite much in automobile industory .
I see hybrid car running like usual car in Tokyo everyday .

People desire to transport will not be extinguished and probably raise more since all cultural and technological development leads to developmento of individuals and individualism at least for a mid-term .

Automobile industory may introduce different style and small sized commuter with eco-tech in near future .
After passing a couple of decades , style or size of car might be changed but , supported by efforts of industory and individualism , I do not think that # of car in use will decline .

Improvement of IT enviroment in daily life , make people easy to access to information which they want or curious about without physically going there , but it also opens up actual desire to be there where they do not know by then .

Environmental problems may be solved or cured , at lease softend by technological effort and investment .
People desire to travel may maintain even in the future .
IT environment and quick approach to whatever information may leave the actual desire to experience , touch , feel and taste something physically away .

They may increase the # of cars , honestly .

9209,1469368.txt,P5,FRA,medium,"Nowadays , oil becomes even rarer and even more expensive and some people believe that in thwenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
We will explain why this statement could occur or not in the future .

On the one side , petroleum is becoming more and more expensive to produce because there are limited areas where we can find it and lots of them are unreachable or unavailable , for instance because they are under big cities .

Moreover , governments are developping tube , train or bus to encourage people not using their own car and to pollute less .
For example , lots of advertisements for taking the train instead of driving are currently shown in the tube in Paris .

On the other side , the population of Third-World countries is growing , and at the same time , lots of people who were using the bike in China are considering bying a car .

Futhermore , lots of workers still need a car when they do not live in big cities because busses are not as frequent .
For this reason , it is still easier for them to rely on their own car rather than on a bus that can pick them just every hour .

Besides , scientists are considering developping cars with hybrid motors , which rely both on electricity and oil .
It could be a very good solution to the cost of the oil .
For the moment , those cars are puchased above all in Japan but thay may be soon be sold in all the countries of the world .

To put it in a nutshell , the issue of the cars is rather an issue of oil supply .
Till hybrid cars are not very fame , the number of cars could hence decrease .
However , it would rather be the case in big cities where people have other ways to go to work .
To my mind , twenty years is a very short time to introduce hybrid cars but it is also a vey short time to make people change their behaviour by not using their can as often as today .

Though he is more physically active , but he may not have the resources to enjoy the way he wants .
His social and personal obligations would keep him occupied all the time .

We can get know each other during the trip .

We might not have enough time to look over everything in a week by ourselves .
We might waste a lot of time on looking for place .
However , if we can travel in the group led by a tour guide , they can arrange the time for us .
We can visit as many place as we can .
We will not waste our time on looking for the place .

Last of all , I like to travel in a group led by a tour guide because they can interduce many local culture , food , building , and many things else for us .
You might have some experience about when you visit some countries , you do not know what can eat and where you can go .
I have this kind of experience , too .
When the first time I went to Japan , I went alone .
I did not know where I should go and what the good food I can eat .
I wasted my time and money on eating fast food in Japan .
However , when the nex time I went to Japan with the group led by a tour guide , I had a good time in Japan .
I went to many famous places in Japan .
I also ate a lot of goog food in Japan .
All of them , I would not know if I did not go with the group led by tour guide .

The techonologhy is getting more modern everyday .

Because of the traffic problem we need to use puplic transporting vechiles like metro or bus .
There are a lot cars on the streets and its really hard to travel by car .

The scientists are working for transporting objects with the speed of light and they succeed about transpoting lights .

Im sure that they are going to solve this problem and then we will able to travel faster , Needless to say , there will be fewer cars than there are today .

Because of this , if all of we have broad knowledge of many academic subjects ( who better of others , that 's clarify ) , we certainly have more problem to find the dreams ' job .

In spite of this , if somebody has a specialistic skill , maybe he 'll find less work announces that respond to his qualifing , but surely he wo n't challenge , such as others with a widespread standard knowledge , too hard to obtain that work .

I 'm an `` almost engineer '' , I see every day on the newspapers , on TV , at my university how hard is today find worthy people : too many people have to broad knowledge of many academic subjects , too many people have to challenge on the same jobs .

This is my personal opinion on this stateme

4374,758402.txt,P8,FRA,medium,"Trying to do your best is what sociey asks you .
So you could improve the knowledges and skills of the country .
Therefore you have to imagine and to create new concept to be said succesful .
Hence to know if it is useful to take risks and tr new things , you have to answer those questions .
Firstly , if you do your job good but not improve it what would be the result ?
Secondly , if you refuse to take decisions because of risks that implie would you give a chance to your company to survive ?
And eventually , if you become successful , would you stop there without trying to do once more time your best ?

Improving your job , your knowlegde and trying to invent new processes , or new way to work are manners to get a better job , to grow up the social scale .
Thus is is required be becme a successful people to reach to top of this scale .
For instance , Einstein become successful afer having develop his theory of relativity which was such a revolution , such a new things at the time .

Then succesful people have to design new concepts in order to be recognized by the sociaty a successful .

Improving knowledges is not the only way to be admitted among successful people .
People such as Gustave Eiffel took risks .
M.Eiffel had to accept to hear many criticises about his tower .
Afterward , he was congratulate abou this construction which has become on of the more relievant French building .

Therefore taking risks such as many architects have done seems a good way to succeded in his field .

But what will you do once you are becm successful ?
u stop and leave of your patterns , not your ae encourage by your relatives and working staff to go on .
Hence , you will take more risks and proving yourself you could be more innovating .

To conclude , I believe that people have to be creative new , not to be afrad of danger if they want to develop their field of specialisation .
However from my point of view , peple who manage in their work have to take care not to go to far , and to be awared that skills of every humans have limits .

10713,1747806.txt,P8,ARA,medium,"As the dictum says : `` hard work works '' .
It is hard to become a succesful person , but there is nothing easier than losing what we have been working for .
The goal of each person is to succeed .
But there is no limitation to success .
As an example , a rich person will always try to get richer .
According to the old philosophies , the human nature is based on desires .
A man or a woman is always in search of new things that will allow him to develop his or her experience .
No one of us is free because we are all conditionated by our perpetual desires .
The satisfaction of a desire systematically caused a new desir .
The philosophy calls this `` the hegemony 's human nature '' .

`` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . ''
Let 's take the example of Alexandre the Great who was dominating all the mediteranean area .
Because of his desire of hegemomism , he wanted to mater the whole world and that led him the the loss of his empire .
Let 's point out more concrete examples : In the capitalist world , a company will always try to conquer new markets ( as globalization ask for ) rather concentrating on his own market ...
this can cause the company 's failure .

As far as I am concerned , I completly agree with the following statement : `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .
This is the human 's nature and no one can denie it .
But humans are trying to decrease these risks with philosophies as the oriental philosophies by defending the next theory : `` control the desires in order to master only what we know how to do well and avoid the risk of losing what we have '' .

8389,1313483.txt,P5,ITA,medium,"I disagree with this statement because I guess that in the future there will be a lot different cars because the industry will produce more different models of cars and the people will be attracted by evolving future technology .
Nowdays the governments are making a lot efforts , but not enough in my opinion , to fight the pollution , and one of these is to give economical support to someone buying electric cars that doesn ' t damage the enviroment .
For this reason I believe that a lot of people will be needed to buy new cars and will be attracted by new futuristic models .

Another important reason of the car ' s number increase in twenty years is that the people , like today , will consider to own a very nice car as status symbol and will try to demonstrate to each other to be the most actractive and respectful person only for having a beatiful car .
Furthermore another aspect that we have to consider , is that our society will be always more sedentary because the people will not tolerate to go to work or shopping by public transport and will like rather than moving towards the downtown driving a very new car with all optionals in order to show to other people .
I think that this aspect is very stupid but I see every day this behavior and I guess that it will not change .

In conclusion I believe that the number of cars will be greater than today , and we will have always more enviromental probems , and the traffic and car accidents will increase .
This is my pessimistic view of the future

5075,884047.txt,P5,TUR,medium,"Since the middle of the 20th century , cars have become a significant part of the daily life of human .
Consequently , most of the people are not able to imagine a life without a car .
In my following essay , i would like to introduce to you my point of few on whether the use of cars in the early future will decrease or not .

In the first place , we should have an in-depth view of the main function of cars .
Like everybody can guess , it is transportation .
A car helps us to reach places , where we want to go in a pretty short time .
For me personally , that means to be independent from others .
The possibility to drive wherever I want to drive and which way I want to take gives me some sort of freedom .
On the other hand , I can drive to the university , without needing to take public transportation , which signalizes once again dependency for me .

Besides of that , we should not forget , that there are also enthusiastic drivers among us , who never leave their cars unwatched .
For these kind of people , a car represents a hobby , in which they like to invest all of their free time .

The last , but I think most important fact is , that research is working on finding out alternative energy sources .
Examples , which are already in use , are electronical or solar drives , which do not need the `` classical '' petrolium .
Through these and upcoming future inventions , car driving will become much cheaper , which will have the consequence , that more and more people will decide to drive cars .

maybe petrolium and gas will get more expensive , but in maybe less then 20 years , there will be created cheaper alternative energy sources for car .
"
7376,1148255.txt,P8,KOR,high,"Before deciding which side I will stand , I would like to querry what is defined as successful people .
If successful people mean people who made a big advance in our life , I agree that successful people try new things and take risks .
However , if successful people mean people who live well doing their jobs well , I think successful people are those who only do what they already know how to do well .

First , you should know the history of human 's first exploration of the moon .
I think the people who were involved in that momentous event are those who are successful .
Unless did they plan to travel to the moon and enact their plan , we could have made no progress in our knowlege of the universe and our technology in relaion to aironaut .
With respect to human knowlege advance , I believe that successful peopel are those who try to do what has not been done .

Second , I even can observe how people move towards what they want .
For example , my husband make seemingly unfeasible things possible .
When he faces a barrier , such as dealine , facility unavailities , and job opening , he tries evey means .
He call to companies that do not announce any jod \ b opening .
But , he advertise himself and get a position .
He enjoys his way of life , which seems to make him as a successful person .

However , I also can find people who lives well without a big challenge .
For example , medical doctors seem to live well following well-defined paths .
Although they have to study had in roder to get into a medical school , I think they do not have to try new medical procedures .
On the ready-established path , they are considered as successful people .

In sum , it is difficult to devide people into successful and unsuccessful people according to whether they try new things and take risks or not .
Rather than , I think successful peole could be defined according to whether individual lives the way of life they value .
If a person who pursues taking a risk lives by trying new opportunities , he would be a successful person .
If a person who pursue a challenge lives in a way that is already established , he would not be considered as a successful person .

1279,212983.txt,P5,FRA,high,"First of all , it 's hard to say if there will be or if there wo n't be fewer cars in twenty years than there are today .
This issue has to be discussed , and both points of view have to be advocated through good and reliable arguments .
On the one hand , I think that the number of cars will increase in the next two decades .
Indeed , there will be more people allowed to pass the driving license .
Everyday , the earth population is increasing so , it 's mathematicly logical that there will be more cars in the next twenty years .
Furthemore , I think that there will be more automobiles because of , or should I say `` thanks to '' , the development of tourism .
Along the years , people have used to use the cars for going on vacations for exemple .
As well , the more the society is changing and evoluating , the more people can provide them with a car , this locomotion mean is no longer a good for rich people .
As well , we live in a period where it has become natural to use our cars .
Nowadays , we take the car to go to the supermarket as well as to go to the butchery with is 500 meters far from our house .
Because of the development of the automobile industry , we have become completely lazy or , at least , we tend to become very lazy ...
On the other side , I think it 's possible that there will be fewer cars in the next twenty years : as a matter of fact , people are more concerned about the environment and we can see the emergence of new environmental organisations struggling against car pollution .
Furthemore , the governement might have planned to make downtown Paris , a discrict where people will have to pay for entering it .
In London , the congestion charge was implemented a couple of years ago and there is fewer cars and less pollution in the center of the British capital city , according to the environmentalists people .
Moreover , a lot of people take the commun transport to go to work , to go out at night so , why would this change ?
A lot of inhabitants of Paris have understood that it was more simple to move by the subway or bus instead of by car .
My last arguments will be that the cost of oil will increase for sure ...
That will be prevent people for using their cars as they usually do !
"
3220,558426.txt,P5,SPA,medium,"If we are taking about the whole world , in my oppinion there will be at least as many cars as today .

It is a possibility that in modern countries , we will use the car less and less with the pass of the years .
We live in growing cities , every day a higher pertentage of the population lives in cities .
And every one that live in a big city can tell you the unusefull and expensive bussines is to have a car .
Is much more eficent to take the public transportation system or even a motorbike , or even a bike .
Any of this solutions is cheaper and faster than moving thoughout the city by car .

In addition we have the problem of the petroleum .
We are aproaching to the famous peak oil .
Some day in the close future we could not attend all the energetic demand of the world just with oil .
So oil and fuel will enhance his prizes , and having a car will be more and more expensive every day .
So not every one will be wealth enough to have a car and use it as today .

But in the other hand there are a lot of high populated contries , developing countries .
Is reasonable to suppose that many people of these contries will be rich enough to pay for a car and its manteinance .
Also , it is important to be aware that having a car , is one of the most tipical of symbols of wealth and social success , and for the people of these contries , to become a car owner will be surelly prioritary .

So although in Europe and the USA , we will probably have less cars , in China , India or Brasil the number or cars will certently increase a lot in the next few decades .
So this is the reason I do not agree the statement above .
"
790,127325.txt,P5,TUR,medium,"Cars are the indispansible part of our life .
I ca n't imagine how life would be if there were n't any car .
They are like the member of our family .
Because people like cars even more than it used to be .
They are trying to make their car more comfortable and beautiful since they spend so many times at roads .

Some people consider that cars wo n't be the part of our life in twenty years because the oil reserve of the world is decreasing very rapidly .
So maybe only rich people will be using cars in the future .
Can you imagine this , maybe there wo n't be traffic jam .
And also this is not a real proof .

I think we wil be more dependent on car in the future because our life is changing in so many ways .
The density of population is considerably increasing .
So these people will need cars to go somewhere .
I am totally disagree about the idea that we will use less car in twenty years because people have began to use new sources instead of petrol such as biodisel and electrycity .
From my point of view that will help humanity to save the environment since that does n't give harm to environment like petrol .
And also technolgy is still trying to develope new kind of things to support cars to work .
What is more , what will the people do if there will be fever cars .
Are we going to fly or something like that .
I think what is said about this is not based on scientific evidence because we need cars and we will drive them at least a hundred years .
We can also say that the woman driver are more than in the past and they will be more in the future than now .
So the factories take these kind of things in to account .
Nevertheless they do n't seem to stop producing cars .

To sum up , I believe that cars are the part of our life and people do n't seem to leave them for a long time .
Although the bad impacts of cars to the environment we ca n't disregard how useful they are .

2060,354992.txt,P3,ITA,medium,"Nowadays communities are at the base of our society , which is made up of children , young prople , adults and old people .
Adults and young people are the most active part of our society .
The statement ca n't be taken as an absolute , I think that It depens on the society in which we live .
At different societies corresponds a different way of thinking .
First I have to point out the importance of the education .
As a matter of fact especially in Europeans countries and North American countries , where education is a fact of great importance , young people are more involved in our communities in order to help them .

It is a biunovocal relation as the more young people can help their communities the more can be both educated and help in their growth .
There are some activities such as parish activities that inovolves young people .
For instance I usually help children to sudy as a volounteer .
That is a good way to help our community .

Nonetheless I have to state that in some delevoping countries young people have no much freedom and that causes many problems in the relation between communities and young people .
Moreover all people tell them what to do without giving them reasons .
Besides there is some young people who do n't figure out why they should help communities .
This is due to the fact that there are egoist and they do n't like to help others .
But It 's not completely thei fault .

There are different outlooks in the education of a person .
One can choose not to force his son and let him stay all day in front of a computer or in front of television or one parent can make the choise of spend time explaning to his son the importance and the lovely sensation that hammer out in helping others , that i sto say in helping communities .

In conclusion I support the idea that if It seems that young people nowadays do not give enogh time to helping thier communities maybe it is because they had never seen adults do that with passion and love .
So we have to own out our resposabilities and never give up in front of unforeseeable hindrances , instead we can change our outlook and we can share our sparetime with young people in order to focus togehter on the big opportunity we have to help our communities .
"
6933,1107099.txt,P3,ITA,low,"Nowadays is more difficult to find young people that give enought time to helping their communities because they have a lot of things to do .
For exemple , if a studend go to the university he will not have the time to spend for anything because he must study and he must do the homework and in particolary case he have to caught the train .

young people spend also a lot of time to do inusefull things like smoking and staying in a bar .
I can say with may experiences that there are a lot of young people that spend their time to helping their communities .
I usually go to hospital as volontian and I can see some gay like me .
There are different way to help the communities : it is possible to help some people that feel ill in a hospital but sometime you can not see that there are some people near you that need your help .
You can go to the church and give your contibution for the poor people and if you want you can prey for them .
Now I can say that is truth that some young people do not give their time for different motivation but I sure that also only one little help , like a sweety word is important to help someone .
You can not see a little thing but is very important .
In conclusion I hope that there are young people that help needly person in different ways .

9824,1589957.txt,P2,JPN,medium,"Young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I disagre to this statement .
I have 1 reason to support my opinion .
The way of younger people and older people has diffrent ways of enjoying there lifes .

From younger people , what the olders do does n't look so enjoyfull .
I think that is because youngers have many things diffrent from the olders have .
Like strenth and ideas they have .
When a younger people spends a day , they can do lots of diffrent things .
For example , they can do any sports they want to do like soccer , tennis and any things even hard sports like american foot ball .
But when a older people spends the day , what day can do is limited .
For example , they ca n't do hard sports that move around lot , they ca n't travel as much as the youngers and lots of ather things and what they can do is like sleep , have some walk , have a chat with freinds , stay home and somethings like that .
When people look at this and had to choice from two of them , I think allmost all of the people will serect what the younger does because it looks more intertaint then what the olders do .
Allmost everybody thinks young people enjoy life more than older people do but it is n't right .

3049,528462.txt,P1,JPN,medium,"I agree with the statement that it is better having broad knowledge rather than supecialized in one specific area .

This is because everything in this world is related with each other and you cannot solve any problems or do something new without having other knowledge .
For instance , cooking , chemistry and biology seem all different subjects which does n't have relationship with each other .
However , they are strongly connected with each other and you wo n't be able to do any cooking without having knowledge of chemistry and biology .
You might think not all people cooking at home have had class of beth chemistry and biology .
I take your point ; what you have thought is absolutely true .
What I want to say is that you do n't need to have professional and deep knowledge of them .
For example .
if you want to cook meat , what do you do first ?
This is maybe depending on what meat you are going to cook and how tough it is and how big it is .
If this meat is too big to cook or eat , you need to cut the brock into smaller pieces .
This process involving in biology and chemistry , I do n't think you have niticed about it , but when you eat meat smaller pieces are much more digestale in the body system and it wo n't put stress onto the organs .
In the chemistry side , small meat can be quickly cooked and easily killed bacteria .
Now you can see , thousands of different areas are involved in just cooking a brock of meat .

The above is just one example of advantage of having wide knowledge .
How about in the career side ?
I suppose if you have a variety of knowledge you wo n't get bored in the whole life because if you get bored what you do at the moment you can move to the other areas and do whatever you want .

I think it is a easy thing to do new thing with having interest rather than do something which you do n't have any interest at all .

Overall , having wide knowledge helps you to make enjoyable life and live clevaly .
The above example of cooking is a example of this .

10640,1734751.txt,P1,TUR,high,"I both agree and disagree to this statement .

First of all , I believe that a person who lives in an academic environment should have a broad knowledge on a number of subjects .
Because the solutions to todays problems require a broad knowledge from various areas of science .
And those areas are usually interrelated to each other .
Whilst trying to find a relevant solution to an issue , a person could face many problems from a different area of science .
So , the person should at least be familiar with the most basic principles of the related areas .

I also believe , people with a broad knowledge on various subjects can easily understand the problem , find out the relevant options to solve it , and refer to the right fellow academics to get the right answers .
If one does not have a broad knowledge , he/she cannot find the way out of the difficulty he/she may face .

On the other hand , the in depth specialization in a subject is a must in todays academic studies in order to be able to get to the right solutions of the problems in a particular subject .
Todays scientific problems require so good and in depth knowledge that one should be a subject matter expert to conduct relevant procedures in order to get relevant solutions .
Who would think , without the special knowledge in the subject one could be successful ?

So I disagree with a statement `` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' .
Travelling in a group with a tour guide poses problems like following a schedule and following suit .

First and foremost , I travel to visit and experience places first hand to visualize beauty in my own way .
A tour guide will not only force me to view the sites through his eyes but also hinder my experience and impose other unnecessary constaints like time and schedule requirements .
The tour guide will be barking orders and giving all sorts of information that I will hear from one ear and forget it from the other .
I would like to take my own time when watching the breathtaking Niagara Falls or the mind-blowing Egyptian Spinx .

Group travelling will force me to do the same activities others are doing and so , will not allow me some time on my own .
I would be very disturbed with my loss of command over myself .
I would like to be my own boss and do things my own way .
Just because 10 people want to visit the Eiffel Tower for the second time does n't mean that I would waste my oppurtunity to appreciate the Romantic art at the Louvre .
I am just one of those people who love working and doing stuff outside a group .

11859,1952524.txt,P6,SPA,medium,"I disagree with the statement .
In my opinion the best way to travel is alone by yourself .
Travelling alone you can wander for many places knowing the culture of the place that you visit .
Also you can spend your time with native people who show you the identity of such society .

When I go abroad I try to travel alone because you can know the culture and the way of life of the people .
If you travel with a tour guide you could probably know about the history of the place or other topics that you can read in a book .
When you travel alone you can wander for several places not only to the common places such as landscapes or museums .
You can walk throughout the city without a fixed schedule visiting the places that you want .

I like to travel alone instead of travel in a group .
If a travel alone I can spend a lot of time knowing native people .
I can share their customs or their way of life and learn the native language as well .
When you travel in a group you should do anything that the majority want .
If you travel in groups you would spend more time with your group than native people .
I have visited several countries and I have tried to spend most of my time with native people .

I believe that is not the best way to travel led by a tour guide or travel in a group .
If you travel alone you can learn the culture of such place like a native .
You can know many issues that you can not know if you travel like a tourist in a group .
I like to travel alone because I can spend a lot of time with native people knowing their problems and thier way of life .
Therefore , I prefer to travel alone by myself than to travel in a group led by a tour guide .

5590,981322.txt,P8,JPN,high,"There are many successful poeple in various fields in this world .
It can be business , sports , arts , or science .
However , there is a common thing that those successful people have : successful pople try new things , take risks , and also respect the traditions and the old ways that have been known for a long time .

For example , a tennis player cannot start creating a new way of hitting spine serve without knowing how to hit the ball properly .
The player has to go thorough the tough steps of learning basic hitting techniques before doing something new .
Therefore , knowing and respecting the traditions and the old ways is the fundemental step for the person to be successful .

However , just knowing about the past is not good enough for most cases .
Here , I will use an example of a researcher in biology lab .
Even if the researcher obtained good grades during his/her undergraduate level and have great ability of learning what other scientists have done in the past , the researcher is not granteed to be a successful scientist if she/he lacks the ability of creativity .
So , the ability to apply what the person have learned about the traditions and the old ways into new things is the second important element to be successful .

Taking risk may be the third element to be successful ; however , it is not the case in some fields .
For example , a doctor with a great knowledge and ability to adopt it cannot take risks to cure his/her patients if the doctor 's attempting and taking risks result in a number of patients ' death .
However , it is also true that surgents and physicians often take risks in operation room in order to help thier patients .

Finally , being successful is not neccessary important , and maybe it is not something other people judge if the person is successful or not .
As long as the person is satisfied with his/her life and provides a great influences for the world , the person can be considered as `` successful '' .

10612,1729831.txt,P1,TEL,medium,"Specialisation and having a broad knowledge of many different subjects are both equally important .
Both specialisation and general knowledge should co exist together for a society to evolve Specialists are the people who study deeply about a specific subject .
They try to gain as much knowledge of the subject as possible .
Specialists are needed where the surface knowledge about the subject is not enough .
For example if a patient is having a skin problem , initialy a general practioner will try to find a cure , but if the problem is too deep then a skin specialist comes into the picture .
So a specialist is needed whenever a problem is too specific .
But a specialist has a danger of getting isolated in his own work and miss the big picture Having a broad knowledge helps a person to see the big picture .
It helps a person to see the co relation between different things .
The problem is viewed from every angle and also in corelation to other things .
A generalist is needed to see in which direction the society is moving .
He is needed to address the bigger problems of the society .

Thus both general knowledge and specialistion are needed and should complement each other for a society to function successfully

First of all , there are many active , fresh , lively older people .
They have many hobbies , friends , family , so they are enjoying their life .
Some older people looks like so yong !
My grandfather is also one of these people .
It seems to me he is enjoying his life .

Second , there are many yong people who do not enjoy their life .
Some yong people have no hobbies and they are not interested in anything .
For example , today , the number of NEET is increasing in Japan .
They do not want to work and stay home watching TV or eating snack and so on .
They depend on their parents completely .

So , I think that sometimes older people enjoy life more young people .
On the other hand , Some people may say that older people can not move free because of disease or injuring .
So , if they want to play sports , they can not .
But yong people can play actively .

I think this is also true .
But there are also many young people who have disease or injure .
I think it is not true that these people do not enjoy life .

8117,1259835.txt,P1,ZHO,medium,"Developing a broad knowledge base on numerous academic subjects rather than specializing in one specific subject implies acquiring knowlege for the purpose of striving for quantity rather than quality .
In my opinion , broad knowledge complements or rather acts as a foundation of specialization rather than being more favourable than specialize in one specific subject .

Broad knowledge of many academic subjects have been emphasized during our early years of education since it provides students a basis or tool to raise awareness to things occuring round them and a backbone to further develop their knowledge database .

It also acts as an appetizer for people to explore different areas of knowlege and discover one that they are willing to dwell deeper into .
In addition , it secures a certain level of literacy among the population since people have sufficient knowledge to handle daily matters .

However , knowledge is about gaining in depth rather than having a broad yet shallow base .
Broad knowledge is similar to information which is easily lost and can hardly sustain .
It is by specialization in one specific subject that knowledge can be thoroughly researched , experimented , evolutioned and make a difference to the world we live in .

Civilizations take huge strides forward due to the innovation of pioneers who are specialists of their respective subjects .
Multinational pharmacuticals invest billions in research and development to sponsor laboratory experiments in developing new medicine that can treat diseases such as AIDS and malaria .
Lives are saved by the specialists ' efforts which can not be substituted by people having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
Laws and constitutions which act as one of the four pillars of a society is established by lawyers who are also specialists Possessing a wide breadth of knowledge is appreciated as it supports the development of specializing a specific subject which can bring paramount improvements to the world we are living in .

9717,1570522.txt,P2,DEU,medium,"I think its true that most of the young people in an age of 20 bi 21 enjoy there live more than wsome old people in an age of 70 bi 75 .
young poeple have all there power and do n't have to thin about there health an death .
old poeple have not so much pwer and some are rearly frightend about theire death , so they life with thoughts all around there death and so they are not so happy like young people .
But if somone is old but still hase enough power to do sports and if he will be happy too .
When the person hase an religion and believes in an life after death , it would help him or her much not to think always about there death .
So I think that young and old poeple could both be unhappy or happy in there lifes .
when I think about it I 'm comming to the result that yuo ca n't say that old people do n't enjoy theire lif as much as young people do , its different from person to person .
young people have more power than old poeple have but old people have seen more in theire lif than young people , learned more and know more .
young poeple have more problems with love , school and selfconvedence and old people have more problems with death and staieng alone .
Young people and old people enjoy there lifes otherwies .
young people make more sport or go to the disco and dance , but old people can read and learn and have no work to do who says that they ca n't enjoy that .
i think you ca n't say that young people enjoying ther lif more than old people do it i think if you enjoy your lif or not is only on evryone himself .
So if I want to enjoy my lif i 'll do it and when I 'm old I 'm the same person like now

5784,1006883.txt,P8,FRA,high,"I do agree with the fact that successful people have challenging careers that conducts them to have risky positions .

A successful person may be qualified in that way because he or she has been distinguished from other people who has not faced the same success .
And someone has of course many more opportunities to be distinguished in a challenging and difficult environment than is an simple one .
Actually in that last kind of environment , a lot of people may fullfill the duties in a cogent way and we generally expect them to do so , consequently it is a normal situation that does not lead to any particular kind of success .
At the opposite , by having a challenging carrer someone may face many quandaries and diverse kind of problems .
The exposition is bigger .
By being in risky positions , people are not expected to success every time , they may fail but when they manage to solve a problem or develop a difficult or new business , then they are distinguished and become successful people .

Another important point is that being in a challenging environment and taking risks allow people to break the everyday life routine .
Actually , by facing new and difficult situations , people do not have time to get borred .
Their motivation can be very huge considerating the stakes .
By following that idea we can assume that people may fullfull their duties with more enthusiasm that in less risky positions .
Actually , we can easily get bored by doing something we know well so we could give less importance for our job and replace it with other things which is not at all to be unerconsiderated .
People may have different priorities or qualities in life that are not suited to a complex environment .

For these reasons I do agree with the statement , and my opinion can be easily verified with successfull people such as politics or businessmen who faced difficult positions .

532,96442.txt,P6,ZHO,medium,"I 'm absolutely agree with that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .

Travel in a group can solve the problem of boring because you can talk to people who share the commom interests as you are .

Furthermore , travel in a group will be more secure rather than travel alone especilly to those chaotic areas in the destination .

And travel in a group led by a tour guide will reduce the rate of missing famous places and worth seeing sceneries .
Because guide is a person know the place well and he know at which sesason , at what time , where is beautiful and he also can lead tourists to visit avoid the peak time which is very convient for tourists .

Then , travel in a group can make a lot friends during the vacation and can enhance the relationships .
OUr human beings are not isolated ones , we need to communicate .
And in the modern society , whatever organizations or bussiness companies oe even universities all require people have the abilities to work or study as a group .
I had an experience which was impressive .
When I was a junior high school student , my teacher asked us to draw a pitcure which we though is the most beautiful one .
So we began to draw seperately without disscusion .
After a while , each students showed their pitcures which all presented very pale in meaning except one which combine the work of two students and which showed a more meaningful and more various color in it .
Yes , the teacher wanted us to know sometimes work with our partner and shared both valuable things would attribute a amzing result which maybe could not predict .

If travel in a group , we can exercise the ability to be more cooperative and willing to help each other which will make our society more colouful and more competitive in the long run .

I highly recommend to travel in a gruop led by a tour guide .

In fact tey have to do that to attract the customers .
As a customer , we have the choice to buy the item or not .
As i said most of the time the usually products looks much better than the are .

Every comany or shop does that .
It is just part of their business .
The more they sell means the more they are successfull in their work , and in their business .
These kind of adertisements became normal and common in these days , even though there are a few copanies say the right things about their products as they seem .

Anyway , since we know that issue , and we are so familier with it , we should buy what is good for us .
As we know each comany has its own plan to attract the customer .
In these days they even try to call you , and introduse their items to you .
You would see alot of advertisements on internet , in newspapers , in magazines .

Sometimes you might even laugh , when you see something is free .
That thing happened to me , when i was going to buy a cell phone , which has a sticker on it says free .
I was suprised , then i asked the seller he said it is not free , you just pay monthly or weekly as you like .

We see strange things that has to do with markting , because everyone wants to be the best .
Since that they try to do anything to show their items as they want .
In my openion they have the right to make products seems much better than the really are .

2808,486681.txt,P8,ZHO,medium,"I totally agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing familiar things .
In my opinion , successful people , especially in a business world , usually can imagine things that will happen in the future .
They can also see the trend of life therefore they can prepare for the change of life and try new things that may lead them to success .

On the other hand , people who only do what they are familiar with do not have this kind of sight and ability to create things .
To be a successful people , you have to be a pioneer to try new things .
In the business world , `` Time is Money '' .
People do not only compete with others , they also fight for time .
Time is the factor that determines success or failure .
Therefore , trying new things is the key to success .
People who do not take this kind of risks can never be success .
They are just followers following the trend that the successful people created , which makes them always a few steps behind the successful people .

Risk taking is also an important part to achieve success .
Taking risk does not mean not caring about the probability to success .
As i mentioned , successful people have the sight to see future things .
The risk taking is based on what they see in the future .
Some people just do not have this kind of talent , if they do not think things over before taking a step , they will never be succeed .
Therefore , risk taking is blended with the ability to notice how the world is changing , not just taking risks randomly .

Based on my knowledge , I totally gree that the difference between successful people and the people that will never succeed are the gut and knowledge to try new things and take risks .
Those are the keys to success .

He is japanese who I met in New York .
At that time when he came New York by ship , it was n't common at all .
Just few japanese were living in New York and nobody had n't tried to come studying hair cut .
When he came New York , he was so poor and could't speak English at all .
He did n't know how he could learn hair cutting .
So he just went into hair salon and asked to teach .
And also he tried to make friends little by little .
After few years later he got chance to have a shop .
Now he has many salon all of the world .

My father is also one person who took risks .
He is living in small city in Japan .
He is an archtecter and he has a office by himself .
So he has to do all works by himself .
I think it is a risk .
He can do everything how he wants , but when he is sick nobody do n't his job .

7088,1122260.txt,P2,ITA,medium,"I think that it is a common opinion that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
In my opinion this is not so far from the real situation , but it can depends on what you mean with enjoy .
There many different aspects in this statement so I think that it is difficult to give a unique and clear opinion .

For instance , if you like play football you will not probably enjoy yourself if you are an old man .
A young boy is more powerfull and he can play for a long period of time , while an old man will probably lose his energy in few minutes , not so much time for a good and amusing match .

On the opposite , if you like to play your guitar , your age will not be a real problem .
Even if you are ten years old or seventy years old you can enjoy yourself as you want .

Maybe we can say that a young boy may have less problematic thought than an older person , so his innocence can let him the possibility of enjoying much more his life .

For example an adult man has many more things to do than his son .
He may have no free time so the young child can do anything he want to enjoy himself , while his father has a life full of problems , so he can not enjoy as his child .

There is an another aspect in this discussion that is of relevant imporatance .
Older people are often more rich than young people are .
So they can do anything they want , because they have much more money .
For example if you are a twenty years old boy and you like yacthing you may have some problem to buy one yacht .
Maybe you will buy it in your adulthood .

At the end I think that the foundamental aspect of the topic is the possibility to be sick when you became an old man .
This is a big problem and makes me think that if you are a young person you will enjoy much more your life .

3147,546031.txt,P4,ARA,high,"I totally agree with this statement because many were those who were the victims of t.v ads , in advertsements the only intrest of the advertiser is to promote an object , an idea or a newly launched product not caring whether it might affect the consumer in a positive or negative way or if it was a product intended for internal , use if it might cause any bodily damage .

Ads are the best way also to increase the sales of a product so overall it is mainly to increase sales and thereby profit .
For example i have seen many ads on tv promoting for weight loss pills , or even shorts that when worn during exersice increases prespiration .
Some weight loss pills are FDA approved others arent which might cause severe drug - drug interaction or even food-drug interaction resulting in severe damage to health .

As for the shorts if not washed frequently , might also cause severe skin conditions .
Other things like topical creams that when applied can redeuse 1 or 2 or 4 inches from the waist or hips as stated by the ad can just make people more lazy , by believing the ad they buy it and use it then sit around the whole day snaking and watching tv thinking that a miracle will happen .
When the results are negative they just loose hope and look for another product or quit trying altogether .

Other products include skin care products that make wrinkles disappear , they have the same harm if they are not approved and if they are not being officially sold in pharmacies .
There are also ads promoting for long vacations in some luxurious resort , the idea may be appealing but on arrival there might be lack of facilities and some problems that were not specified in the ad which might make the holiday tiresome .

Young people like child or teenagers migth expect life to show many ways to make them happy or funny .

In the other hand , older people should make ends meets to life , if they did colect enough money , or life by their jobs , depends the case .
Most of them have on their mind the way to spend life , that is way , they do not expected the life to show an enjoy life .
They might think to spend a good life trying to enjoy , however it is too difficult , enjoy and spend good life everytime , than the most of young people are able to get .

2112,363617.txt,P5,ZHO,high,"Today , the world has grow on a rapid pace with fast development and high technology .
Through the innovatives of scientists and engineers , cars become part of our everyday life .
In my opinion , the numbers of cars would increase instead of decreasing in twenty years ' time because cars are convenient , traffic systems are improving and lack of alternatives .

On average , each house has at least two cars in my neighbourhood .
This example applies to most of the urban and sub-urban cities around the world too .
I strongly think that cars are the most convenient and easy means of travelling on roads .
Compared to motorcycle or bicylce , it is less dangerous and it could accommodate more passengers .
These qualities are equally important to the people in future whether the distance between one place to the other is short or long .
Consequently , the number of cars would easily increase .

Besides , cars are undeniably the most important vehicle in the world when it comes to travelling on road .
As countries all around the world racing to develop their traffic systems , it is proven that cars serve as the best travelling medium .
With the government working on ways to reduce traffic problems and improving the condition of roads to facilitate more cars , it is believed that the usage of cars are highly encouraged .
Therefore , more people would remain or resort to cars as their main vehicle when it comes to travelling .

In addition , there is no adequate alternatives to substitute the usage of cars .
Due the convenience and easy-accessible of cars , many would resort to cars instead of other forms of transportation .
For example , the train .
Although it is an environmental friendly type of public transport , the construction of the stations and railways would costs the government an exorbitant amount of money .
It is rather impossible to connect the whole country with train services .
Thus , cars are still the main option for the people in twenty year 's time .

Despite the forever increasing price of gas or petrol , and also the number of road accidents , in twenty years there will not be fewer cars in use .
With the cooperation between the government and the people , those minor factors could be resolve while the people could enjoy fully the benefits of using cars .

885,144911.txt,P3,JPN,medium,"I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
That is because young people are busy on their business time and on their private time .
Let me explain why young people are busy on those two time .

On business time , young people are apt to have a lot of tasks comparing to a business person in 20 years ago .
In this two decades , most of companies in the world have been decreasing a redundant costs .
So a lot of workers is dismissed .
Consequently business persons who can avoid lay off have a lot of tasks which dismissed workers have .
In my case , I work at a famous bank in Japan which is Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi .
I always work from 9 am to 22 pm because of having many tasks .
Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi made lay off in last year.2000 workers were dismissed .
In my department which is composed of 8 bankers , two old bankers were dismissed .
So the tasks for 6 bankers increased .
Therefore I do not have a enough time to helping my communities in weekday .

On private time , young people are also busy .
Young people have a lot of media , for instance mobile phone and internet , comparing to a person in 20 years ago .
So young people are apt to spend a lot of time for using those medea .
For my experience , my mobile phone ring 20 times in a day .
My parents and friends always telephone me .
Additionally I was recieved 50 e-mails in a day .
So I need a lot of time for responing those calling and e-mails .
I do not have a enough time to helping my communities on my private time .

As a mentioned so far , I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
As developing of business and techenology , we are tend to be busy

6999,1114352.txt,P1,KOR,medium,"Is it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific suject they choose ?
It is not so easy to say which is more desirable .
Often it seems to be dependent on the characteristics of the person .
But I disagree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge concerning many areas than to specialize in one specific subject for the following two reasons : firstly no one can reach the full knowledge of every aspect , secondly it is more profitable for each person to study in his or her own area and then share the result .

At first , no one grasp the entire knowledge of every subject .
What is easy to scientists may not be easy to sociologists .
Also What is natural to sociologists may not be natural to scientists .
We have the limitation of intelligence , thoug we do not have the limitation of interest .
So if you try to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , eventually you can find your knowledge very superficial .

In addition , it is more desirable for each person to study in his or her own area and then share the result .
For example , life scientists concentrate their capacities on studying the system of life .
Their result helps many people who do not know about the system of life .
That is more helpful for our society .

All things considered , it is better to specialize in one specific subject thant th have broad knowledge of many academic subjects in respect of individual ability and social advantage as well .

It is certainly true that taking risks sometimes scares person and make hesitate to doing something new .
However , I have seen people who get to succeed due to taking risks in thire life .

First of all , It is often said that high risk makes high returns .
My father-in law invest the almost of his saving and posetions on bigining a new bussines when he was in mid twenties .
It is really challneging incident .
He resighed the company he worked as a employee .
It meaned he lost his stable and countinus income .
If the invest was failed , it is difficult to live form tommorrow .
He could not afford his wife and children at that time .
However , he 's bussiness was succeed and he earn much money than before .
He could make his children to take a good education and he is living without financial worries now .

Secondly , this is not such a successful story but may be my trivial experience .
I tend to try new things always .
For example , I often go to the new restaurant to seek the new receip and taste .
Sometimes it ends to fail because new taste was not suitable for my favourite .
However , I feel very excited when I looking for new rentaurant and this proccess makes me happy .
I lrealized from my experience that seeking for something new makes people happy and excited .
I think that this is essential and important atittude to lead success in one 's life .

Finnaly , I think that it is boring only to do what they already know how to deal with .
It would make your everyday life routine work .
We feel excited only when we have some stimulates from new things .

From avove three reasons , I definitly agree the idea that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .

Although they do n't much more spirit than the young people , they value enjoying life more than young people .

Older people cannot live in the world with a long period of time , so they try to enjoy life with their sons , daughters , wives , or husbands .
They try to spend much more time on their families , besides spending time on working .
It is because many of them are retired or work less than young people .
Young people always spend their time on their works , without enjoying life with their families .

Moreover , older people realized that they have so many things , which they want to do most .

10627,1731993.txt,P5,DEU,high,"In the following text I discuss the question if in twenty years are fewer cars in use than today .
First of all you have to take into consideration the country you are talking about , because I am sure it is too difficult to discuss the development of car sales for all over the world .

In my case , I am going to talk about the amount of cars in Germany .
As far as I know , Germany is already one of the countries that has a very high rate of car users .
That is why it becomes harder to sell more and more cars .
Moreover it is important to know that cars are not cheap at all .
Thus , the wealth of a country influences the car sales as well .

In Germany there is one more factor .
The greens are an important power in the german government .
That can be explained by the wish of minimizing the pollution .
People do not want to see their children growing up in a world full of cars which pollute the air .

On the other hand scientists always try to improve the quality of cars and it is possible , that they will invent a car which will not pollute our environment anymore .
So I am sure , such a car would lead to more cars in twenty years .

One huge disadvantage of cars is the trouble on the streets .
In my opinion it is horrible to cross a bigger city like Berlin or London by car .
It usuallz takes several hours and even if you have been in a good mood , you will be in a very bad mood after the third traffic jam .
Compared to cars it is so much more comfortable to take the underground in a big city .
More and more young people want to live in the city and they grew up with ideas of how to avoid pollution and that is why I think in twenty years will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

Facts are things that are true no matter what and in pretty much every scenario .
Although ideas and concepts can vary .
Ideas are what a person or a group of people believe and may not be one hundred percent concrete .
Concpets can be altered , modified or even proven to be false .

A fact would be , what goes up must come down .
That is a proven fact .
No matter where you are on earth , whatever is launched up into the air not matter how high , it will eventually come plumitting down back to earth due to the gravitational pull .

1539,257665.txt,P1,FRA,high,"According to me , I think that it 's better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
It allows us to have knowledges in differents domains , to understand so many things and to posses all the basis in order to choose a specialization , in case of one .

Firstly , I think that a broad knowledge of many academic subjects gives us a very wide range of informations .
This range of informations permits us to become aware of a lot of things , subjects and topics .
We can learn so many notions that it would be a pitty of not integrating various knowledges .

Second , I think that there are a lot of things very intersetings in this world .
Knowing thoses , allows us to understand the place and the world where we live in .
It gives us a different perception of the life , not a focused one as if we are specialized in a particular subject , that could be a very deep one but not very large .
Be this way of thinking we become more open-minded and our place in the society will be a result of that .

And finally , by having broad knowledges of many academic subjects , a specialization will occur alone and naturally .
We all have affinities for a specific domain , so by knowing a lot of things , one points will appear as more captivating than the others .
This view demand more research than if we want to specialize us in one domain , but it also permit us to compare diferrents subjects and then choose the best one for us .

To conclude , I would like to say that a wide broad knowledge of academics topics is decidely better than a specialization .
We live only one time on earth , and knowing things in a hudge range of domain is a possibility that we have the benifits of .
So , why being closed-minded and focused on one thing we suppose the best for us when there is too many fascinating things to know ?

7003,1114626.txt,P6,ARA,high,"The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide is a statement I can totally agree with and my opinion is based on several factors .

First off , the main reason of traveling usually is to explore the place visited , and see the beautiful attractions in it .
That 's why it is necessary to find a professional and experienced local to guide you to the places because he knows his job and he knows what he 's doing so he would with no doubt take you to the places often tourists admire like : beautiful scenes and natural beauties .

For an example , I remember when I went with my family to Egypt .
I remember we met this young woman who was appointed to meet us as our tour guide .
I ca n't find words to describe how excellent were her choices and how greatly were we satisfied with the places we have seen and the activities we 've taken part of , since we saw most of the breath-taking attractions in Giza like : the Pyramids , Sphinx and the national museums in that area where we had this short lesson about hyroglyphs .
Also getting a tour guide who 's also local can make a splendid combination because you ca n't find someone who 'd try hard to show you places in his town to make you love the place like a local .

Second off all , by getting a touring guide you can avoid some great deal of trouble you may face if you were all alone .
Touring guides often accompanied with security guards who 're common and familiar with situations that can cause some tourists a kind of unhappiness , or make them uncomfortable or in worst cases be in danger such as : getting caught in the overwhelming traffic , being lost , get a good deal of disturbance by beggars , or even in worst cases being endagered by tourist-targeting criminals .

So that 's why I do think that tour guides are a must , instead of going solo , getting unsatisfied with what you see and give the place you visit a bad name as a result of that choice you 've taken .

First of all , most of young people do not have enough time for using their time for enjoyment .
Young people need to work to obtain saraly and they have to support their family .
As they are very busy to work they do not have the time to do something enjoyable .
To make matters worse , they need to rest on holiday because they are often tired with daly work .
On the contrary , older people do not have to work because they can live with social security system .
They can spend their time for enjoyment instead of work .
In Japan , for instance , a lot of older people go for a trip , concentrate on hobby , excercise in park with thier friends .
As a result , I can say that older people actually enjoy life more than young people .

Second of all , older people generally have the money for enjoying the life .
As I mentioned above , older people can live with social security sysem .
They can obtain money for living from government ( as least in my country , Japan ) .
The money which is offerd by government so enough that old people can use it for enjoyment such as trip or shopping .

Finally , older older people are experienced man who know how to enjoy the life .
As they live longer time than younger people , they actually know the way to use the time effectively .
For example , older people have a lot of memories by which they can enjoy to talk each other .
They also have familes include grandson .

It is true that there are some older people who do not have enough time , money , and experience for enjoying life .
All in all , though , I think that older people have advantages for enjoying life .
That 's why I disagree with the statement .

9504,1530737.txt,P6,KOR,medium,"First of all , I totally disagree with the following statement .
And the reasons follow .
One , by my personal experience , traveling by a tour guide is way more expensive than by on own .
Because the travel company which the guide is associated in always suggests expensive hotels with bad status and flights .
In that case we might not able to chance to stay in nice hotel with cheap price and have no season discount on flight either .
For example , one of my friend went Germany from Korea with a flight costed more than $ 1000 through the travel company , but I went same country following week , less than $ 850 with getting season descount on my own .

One more thing is that guide always lead the travelers only to famous spots which are listed on the itiniery .
In that case you wo n't get chance to visit some nice place that only few people know .
I once had a chance to stay on a nice old castle in France .
Most of friends are jealous and are dying to visit their after saw the picture I took .

Two , traveling in a group may be safe sometimes .
According to the 8 years of personal traveling experience , most travel accidents occur in a group traveler .
Because when we travel in a group by a tour guide , people are always crowded and they are usually paying attention to the guide .
And that causes accidents such as robbery .
One of my roommate once traveled Spain in a group with a tour guide and the guide said pay attention because they were passing the important spot the guide stated .
And he had paid attention .
But while he were doing so a stranger cutted out his camera .

Three , if we travel alone we get a chance to make international friends .
I still keep in contact with them and when they visit my country I guide them .
Finally , traveling in a gruop is not always good in many reasons .

2756,479359.txt,P2,TUR,high,"It is an undeniable fact that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
There are so many reasons that influence their point of view about life ; their social environment affect their life and they have so much energy and time .

It can be said that young people generally attend the school and they have an environment in the school ; in other words , they have so many friends .
Therefore , they can go to the cinema or theatre together and also , they can just sit in a cafe ; however , old people do not have an opportunity for these activities .
These small things make young people happy and enthusiastic about the life ; that is to say , they do not become pessimistic about life .
Moreover , they can come together and play a game such as taboo or scrabble ; on the other hand , you cannot see old people while playing such games .

Another issue is that young people have so much energy ; therefore , they choose some sports in order to spend their energy .
For instance , they do extreme sports such as bungee-jumping .
Can you think that most of the old people can do such a sport ?

Finally , time can be considered as an important reason for young people in order to enjoy the life .
Older people have to work most of the time and they do not have so much time for entertainment .
They can get bored from working but , they do not any time for having a rest .
In contrast , young people can spare their time for enterteinment .
They have a certain school schedule , but they are free after the school .
They do not have to consider the director or manager like old people do .

For all of these reasons , it can be indicated that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Their social life their energy and time make them enjoy the life .

In addition , we often see a lot of advertisements .
Some of people accept the advertisement , that you see easily .
But some of them hate it .
Because most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

First , I am going tell you about food in advertisements .
The food , that we watch on TV , is more better than they really are .
There are a white fogs and moving something and other good food in addition to the food on TV .
That things make you feel that you want to eat that food .
But acutually if you eat them , you would get mad against the cooker .

Secondly , the house in advertisement on newspaper .
The houses in the picuture is great in newspaper .
They are clean and big and so on .
In addition , the background of the house is very beautiful in only newspapers .
For example , when I was in Japan , I had a habbit .
The habbit is to see some newspaper .
Then I found the very great and beautiful house .
There were near to my house .
So I went there to see it .
But it was different from the house in the newspaper strongly .
Thus , the products that advert is very different from real product

5808,1009359.txt,P6,JPN,medium,"A tour guide have a lot of information about travel , but my opinion is if we do n't trip with a tour guide , the trip will be more exciting .
There are two reasons .

For the first , tour guides know very well about where to stay at night , what to eat , what to buy as a survenior and where to visit .
On the other hand , group memmbers have limitied information about the area where they are taveling .
From this point , it seems better that traveling with ` well informated ' tour guide , but if we travel with guide we depend everthing on the guide .
Without a tour guide , a group can try any thing .
Ofcouse sometime the group may wrong choise , but that is more exciting than just do as the guide said .
Traveling is knowing other food , scene and even air which we ca n't see ordinally life .

Forethermore , traveling in a group without a tour guide will strength relationship of the group .
Since the group does n't have a person who knows what to do , such as leader , they have to think each other for their group .
Every group members must use his brain and discuss in the group about where to visit , what to eat and where .
This way might take more time but the more the group talk each other , the more thier relationship will be strong .

From these two points I prefer traveling without a tour guide to that with him .

11408,1876624.txt,P7,JPN,medium,"Although some students cannot understand ideas and concepts until they learn facts , ideas and concepts have more value for all students to learn than facts .
Understanding ideas and concepts is the first step of studying .
For example , at the beging of studying new thing , a teatcher may give its concept first and then tell facts as an example .
This can happen many times especially in chemistory class .
Firstly a teacher tells a theory , and then students clarify that the theory is correct in a lab class .
This is because to understand chemical experiences , understaning the theory is the neccessary step for students .
If students take a lab class first , they cannnot understand anything even if what they are doing in the class .
Thus , teacing concepts and ideas must be the first step of classes .
However , it is also the truth that there are some students who cannot under stand concepts only in explanations by theachers .

For the students who cannot understand whole of a lecture , this sequence can also work because there is no students , who cannot understand any part of leacture , in class .
During lecture , all students can catch at least so words , which are mainideas and helpful to understand ideas .
If a teacher write these important words and drow some pictures on a black board , all students can write and drow them on their notes .
After a lab class , they can review their notes and will be familiar with the ideas .
Therefore , for this kind of studens , this is very helpful .

5982,1024522.txt,P7,TUR,medium,"Learning mechanism works in different way person to person .
Some people choses to memorise the facts some people choses to learn how the facts can be produced .
Learning concepts and ideas are important because ; you can remember the facts by the brainstorming about the concepts and ideas , and you can be familiar to learn new facts about a different topic .

First of all , it must be accepted that , memorising the facts can be a fast way to learn .
It can be work in small period of time .
You can pass the next examination , for instance .
On the other hand , When you forget the fact , it will be very hard to remember if you dont know the ideas belong them and concepts .
if you learn the ideas and concepts , you can guess how the fact is provided .
So , learning the ideas and concepts can be work on keeping in mind the data for a long time .

Furthermore , once you get used to learn how a fact can be provided from an idea , you can easily learn an unfamiliar topic .
Every lecture has facts and the ideas ' and the relationship between facts and ideas are the same .
Firstly , you will try to understood the ideas .
According to the ideas in the concept , you can learn the facts as stable as you provided these facts .
You can use exactly the same method on learning the new lectures .

As a result , learning the ideas is better than memorising the facts even though it needs larger time to understand .
The datas will be more stable and to remember will be easy and learning new topics will be easier than memorising every fact of every lecture .

5455,955295.txt,P5,SPA,medium,"Nowadays the society is concerned about the increase of oil demanding .
One of the most important oil uses is the transportation , including the people tranportation .
The car presence in the next years , the most commun trasnport for people , could change if new technologies are not developed .

Although cars are getting more and more efficient in the oil spending , the truth is that during the next twenty years the costs of oil will increase a lot , so the cars will be fewer .
On the contrary , the development of alternative energy supplies , like hydrogen , or the use of clean thechnologies like solar energy , could stops the decrease of the number of car used .
Besides , these are nowadays very well acepted by the citizies and the sensibility to the enviromental probles thar oil burning probokes is higher and higher .

Another important question to take into account is the increasing development in high velocity trains with could transport people from the neightbourings to the centre of the most populated cities very efficiently .
This , obviously , will decrease the number of car used .
However , as it can be infered from the last train accident in germany , the safety of the speed trains is one of the main worries people .

As a conclusion , if the clean thecnologies are developed and are capacle to supporte the cars demanding in spite of the costs , the number of cars can could increase .
Nevertheless , if the cost are so high that ordinary people cannot stand them , the technology will be focused to the public transportation .

1206,198232.txt,P5,HIN,medium,"I agree with the viewpoint that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

There are many reasons to prove my viewpoint .

One of the main reasons for fewer cars in use in future may be the crude prices .
Crude prices are increasing day by day which results increase in petrol and diesel prices .
Increase prices will affect the use of the car because it might be very difficult for normal person to cope up wit increase prices .
There is lot of demand for crude and as it is non renewable source , it is going to become expensive in coming future .
Increase in petroleum products have major impact on sales of cars .

Other reason may be increase in traffic due to high number of car sales .
People may get frustrated because of traffic and may prefer using public transport rather than cars .
For e.g most people working in london city travel by train because it is more convinient for them to use train rather than car .
It will be more cheaper for people to use public transport rather than using a car .
Even government is trying to improve public transport which results in more convenience to people .

In future may be prices of cars may rise due to increase in raw materials for making a car .
To compensate with the increase prices of raw materials , company has to increase price of the final product , so this increase in prices is passed on to customer which may resist customers to buy new car .

Increase in pollution due to burning of fuel in cars may push government to impose new laws which may add additional cost to customers and they may get reluctant to buy new cars .

So , in summary there will be fewer cars in use in future than today .
Neways it is very difficult to predict a future but according to me car sales will have negative effect because of the reasons that I have mentioned above .

11830,1948238.txt,P2,ZHO,medium,"The way that the young and the old living their lives are totally different nowadays in China .
And what I agree is young people do enjoy life mor than older people do .

Maybe the most important reason is that young people spend more money .
Almost every young students have some technological instrument , such as CD player , digital camera , mobile phone , MP3 player , or even MP4 player .
But that 's not so popular in adults .
They may only have a very old type mobile phone .
The computers in everyhome have almost become toys for the children , the only function is to play game .
Compared to my classmates , I 'm a saving boy , but compared to my parents , I 'm wasting .
Once , when I was having lunch at a out-door restraunt near my schol , many adults passed me by .
What they do is just leave , because they think it was too expensive .

Another unforgettable reason may be the different style of education we get .
Our parents were told to save when they were at school .
Save , save , save .
All they knew was to save , and they really met some problem , which `` save '' really helped them .
But what I learn is `` Enjoy your life ! '' , so I do .
I enjoy my life so much that what I have enjoyed maybe more than my parents .

Also , love is a factor , maybe someone will ignore .
Adults have many people for them to love .
Their husbands or wives , children , parents .
But for we , we only love ourselves .
We have n't got so many people to love , and we are still do n't know how to love , and who to love .
So the olders want the people they love to enjoy their lives , not themselves , which is completely different from us .

Last , there are some kind of joy that the elder ca n't enjoy , such as some physical sports , such as football , basketball and some dangerous stuff .

So , in my point of view , the youth enjoy lives more than their elders do .

1712,292890.txt,P5,SPA,high,"Over the time , technology has always tend to improve .
It is human nature to improve and become better .
Even the greeks believed that ; As an example , Chronos , cut his father Uranus genitals ; the son would always defeat his father in some sort of way .

Cars present to society as an issue to be discussed .
In fact , cars have been discussed already and are changing as I am writing .
Different asian companies such as Honda , or Nissan have already developed a hybrid car .
This car is based on a mixture of electric power and fossil fuel or commonly known as gas .
This only represents a change along the car product and not just on the industry as a whole .
However , this represents the beginning of the cars death .

Technology has changed massively over time .
Type writters have been replaced by computers , in a matter of 30 years .
Computers would also be replaced in some sort of way in the future .
Cars would also be replaced by different methods of transportation that are more friendly to our globe .
The earth is everyones house and therefore it must be clean and taken care of .
Cars represent a threat for this and therefore they will dissapear .
It is only a matter of time .

People are starting to be more concerned about the enviroment .
Finally some common sense is shown by the population of the world when a newspaper showed that the ozone layer had increased its area over the last year .
This news would follow the partial abolishement of cars as a way of transportation .
Countries like Switzerland , using electric buses show concerns about it .
Cars however , would not be able to dissapear totally .
There would always be someone who would have a car .
However , the rate of cars per country would massively decrease during the next 20 years .
Again the companies stated above are already thinking about diversification and even massive producers of cars such as Ford or General Motors are making huge amounts of losses for this last quartiles .

It should therefore be concluded , that it is only a matter of time for cars to decrease in number .
The enviroment would finally take over car pollution over the next years .
Countries would also agree and help citizens improving methods of transportation and new companies would come out with new goods that would substitute cars .

2487,432143.txt,P7,JPN,high,"Personally , I agree to the following statement : It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
Many students tend to only memorize the facts and formulas when they study for a test and do not try to go more in depth to understand the meaning behind it .
However , memorization of facts only limits that person 's knowledge .
Although to learn the facts of a particular lesson is very important , a student needs to realize the greater importance of fully understanding the ideas and the concepts .

For example , when a student learns new formulas in his/her math class , usually he/she undergoes a process where the teacher explains how these formulas work .
If the student is only taught to memorize the Pythagorean Theorem , he/she will be missing the important value about the theorem .
It is after the teacher has fully explained on how Pythagoras discovered his theory when the students are able to understand the value and the use of it .
They also will able to understand the `` why '' question .
Without the knowledge of why mathematicians use this formula , many of the students will not be able to distinguish when to use these formulas on a test or on a problem .
This is not only a case in a math class .
In many of the science books , students are taught vast amounts of scientific facts such as friction , gravity , and light .
However , to fully understand what these facts mean , they must understand the concept of it .
It is best for the student to understand why friction occurs and how it happens rather than learning what is is .

By learning facts , the students can learn the concerte , objective portion of the subject .
However , through ideas and concepts , they are able to further learn about other possible solutions and perspectives .
When a student fully understands the knowledge and the concept of it , he/she can use this new knowledge in other fields .
For example , just memorizing the facts of sine , cosine , and tangent formulas does not help the student to answer some of the physics questions about angles of light incident and refraction .

Learning the facts only give shallow knowledges .
When the students understand the ideas and concepts on how scientists and researchers came up with the facts , it means that they are truly learning .

It is a fast way of transportation , but cars increase day by day which also increases the pollution and the park problem in modern cities .
Finding an alternative to cars as transportation vehicles may decrease the problems of air pollution and parking place .

The air pollution is a real problem especially in big cities .
There are a lot of cars which is polluting the air with poisonous gases .
Besides many other air polluting factors , the gases from these cars make the cities ' air unbreathable which is very dangerous especially for children .

Another problem caused by the cars is the lack of enough parking places .
Working people prefer going to their jobs with their own cars because it is faster .

There are not enough parking places for so many cars .

The heavy traffic is another problem of the modern man created by a lot of cars .
Traveling by car is time consuming in the high tempo of the working life in which time is precious .
Besides ; it is very stressful .

The solution to all these problems caused by the increased number of the cars may be promoting the public transportation .
By increasing the number of buses ; trains and subways and quality of the servicethe problem can be solved .
The public transportation vehicles may go more places than they go now .
And if the number is increased the service will be faster and better .

2188,378701.txt,P7,TEL,medium,"Yes i agree with the statement , it is more important to understand the ideas concepts of a particular thing .
Because it is more important for any one to have an clear idea about that particular thing to work on it .
I would explain with an example , when i am doing my first semester of my under graduation i use to do my assignments with out understanding them and with out any clear idea about the topic given .
i use to submit my assignments in this way only .
when my examination is nearing , i dont have any idea about the topics because i did n't work on them clearly .
Because , i thought just submitting my assignments in time would help me in the examination , but when i appear in the exam i could not do well because i dont have any idea of the concept of the work .
this makes my grades to be lower .

when the next assignment is given i used to work on it for a long time and tried to get a clear idea about the topic and made my assignments .
this helped me a lot in the final examination to succeed and got a better grade .
this is because understanding the concept of that made me to do well in the examination .

Another example is that , when an experiment is explained in an class room it is again asked to make the same one in laboratory .
i used to neglet to concentrate on the laboratory class .
when i used to revise the topics covered after so many days , i used to forget the particular thing expalined in the class room and i again should see the particular professor for the left over one .
If i would have performed the paritcular thing in the laboratory i would get the clear idea and the concept of the topic and would have remembered the thing in that topic .

so i conclude that it is important for students to understand the clear concept than it is for them to learn facts because understanding the ideas and the concept of the topic would do more than fact .

6385,1058201.txt,P1,ARA,medium,"Broading kowledge of many academic subjects is much better than specializing in one specific subject in my opinion .
Not only because it will be more interesting but also because people will benifit more if the subejects are varied .

The main reason that broading knowledge is more helpful is that people will be aware of many things in this world .
they can expand their knowledge in an easy way too .
If the subjects are limited , a lot of people wont care to know about other things in the world or in the kingdom which we live in .
They will be satisfied to have the informations that are circuld around the environment they live in .
I cant judge and say that all people will have poor knowledge , but i 'm sure that the majority wont have that good knowledge .
In other words , our society will be weak .

Also if knowledge is limited to omly one subject , scientist would n't have reached the success which they have today .
For example , if Nuoten did n't bother to expand his research on the gravity and stayed on figuring out why the apple had fallen toward the ground , i do n't think he would have known the formula of gravity at all .
he could have spend his whole life thinking alone and not knowing the reason of gravity .
I think that his effort in studying every single detail made him conclude the concept of gravity .

If i were given the choice in any university or in any school whether to study only my major or have additional subjects , i would choose to study both my major and other additional subjects .
that way i will be not only well educated but also my mind will have a good understanding of the world which i 'm living in .

According to my own experience i 'm sure that the better way to create and improve my student career and first of all my personality is to have broad knowledge of many academic subject .
I refuse the idea that the best way is to specialize in one specific subject .

I 've grown up into an academic system that has always gave me all the chance to learn about everything I 've wanted .
During these years i spent a lot of time to read about a large amounts of material as scientific papers , historian ones , literarian ones and much more .
I think that for a person with a broad knowledge is easier to find job , to create relationship with other peole , to follow the most part of television , paper , and book discussion .
Moreover if you do n't close any doors on your back you can always come back and start with another subject .

By the way I trust that also is important to specialize in one specific subject , because nowadays the world of work requires more and more specialistic workers .
For example i 'm attending a course of biomedical engineering and i know that the society wants to hire personal specialized the deepest as possible .
And the world of science is not the only one ; also in economic field there is a great specialization .
The university are following this way of learning proposing a large number of specialization courses .

In conclusion it could be seem a contradiction but for me the two ideas are related : I believe that before is more important for a student to have broad knowledge of many academic subbjects , and then , only at a second moment , to specialize into specific one .

634,108118.txt,P5,DEU,high,"There are many reasons why the number of cars in use today will not stop increasing in the future .
Just judging from the way cars have become more and more popular and common over the past tweny years it is unlikely to expect a sudden change in that area .

Another point supporting that theory certainly is that cars have become more affordable for everyone and also very easy accessable for young people .
Most people in The United States of America posess their first own car bz the age of sixteen .

Another problem that in my opinion is directly linked to the number of cars and that we are facing today is the problem of obesety in sociey .
In most developped countries peolpe are getting bigger and bigger , become more and more lazy and therefore more likely to drive a car .
Simplz because it is more convenient .

Then again , people are also starting to be aware of the direct link between cars and the effect they have on environmental changes .
Some strongly object to the idea of having a car because they simply can not live withe the thought of destroying the planet out of egoistic purposes .

In a television transmission that i happened to watch a few days ago i also heard a discussion about tha earth running out of natural sources such as oil .
If there is no more oil we will have a huge problem supplying our cars .
Although that is not expected to happen anytime soon scientists are trying to find alternative by developping more natural and environment friendly ways to make an engine work .

But I believe that this will take a huge amount of time and not be presented to the public in the next years .
So , no , i do not believe that there will be less cars in 20 years

5265,914790.txt,P4,KOR,medium,"I think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
In three reason , it can be proved , exazageration , repeating , and useing famous person .
First of all , exageration is good evidence .
Some company can not lie about the its production .
However , they usually use other factors in advertisements .
For example , there are many heathy people and they always smile in the madicine advertisements .
Even though people usually get a medicine when they sick , the advertisements always shsw healthy and happy people .
The consumer might think that they could be healthy if they get the medicine .
But , it is wrong .
This is exageration of advertisements .

Second , many company usually use famous person for advertisements .
If a famous person says '' This is good product .
And I am useing this product everyday. '' , people believe it .
People believe it because they are famous person .
But , usually the product is not concerned with the famous person .
People think that they can be nice if they use it .
But it is wrong because it is just advertisement .

Third , repeating is one of methods many company can use in their advertisements .
When people hear a prase again and again , usually people remember the word and praise .
It is not necessory to say that they will buy the product when they see it .
For example , my wife and I usually go to shopping together .
When we see the same product which we saw in advertisement , we usually buy it .
Because the product is only one thing that we have a information about it .
Even thouth it is just the product 's name or praise it often make an important roll in my decision .

In conclusion , I think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Because many company use exazageration , a famous person , and repeating , people buy the product .

Young people are just trying to enjoy their lives .

They olny enjoy a little in their freetime .
There are a few reasons why they do n't enjoy good enough .
First , they have a lot to do .
They have to study more and more .
They have to go school for their future .
If they do n't study , they ca n't get the garranty for the future .
A lot of new knowlodge come up to the world everyday .
If they want to win the compititions , they have to study more and more .
That 's the way to survive .

Second , they do not have enough money to enjoy .
In generally when they want to do something fun , they need money .
If they travel their country , they need money .
Whatever they want to do , they need money , except the part-time jobs they want .

The last reason is the tons of items to enjoy .
Now they have a lot of things to have fun .
Some young poeple get confused among them .
They do not even know what and how to enjoy .
The floods of things to enjoy can make them hesitate what to choose .

If so , can older people enjoy their lives well ?
My answer is `` Yes '' There are some reasons to say that .
First , older people have enough time to enjoy .
If they retire from their jobs , they can do .
They do not spend their pretty much time to prepare fot the future .
They can just only enjoy their lives .

6917,1106499.txt,P6,SPA,medium,"I disagree with this statement because there are a lot of way to travel .
You can travel alone or with a gruop , with a guide or without guide , all of these depend of the motivations of your trip .

I think the best way to travel will depend of the motivations of your trip .
Maybe if you want to expend so time quitely to relax yourself or maybe to meditate , you will prefer travel alone without guide .
The motivations in that kind of trip is only relax and have a good time .
Some people need these time , in this rush society where all the things pass very fast .
Some poeple need space to enjoy and have time to theirselves .
For these reason I believe if you decide have your time the best way to travel is alone .

But in other way is you want enjoy and take a trip for education reason you will choose go with a group and guide .
The guide will give direction and inform you about the places you will go .
In this ocasion I think the best way to travel is in group because in the group you can share ideas , information and you can learn in social enviroment .

Other example that ilustrate my point is this : supose two men decided make a trip for El Yunque ( forest in Puerto Rico ) .
The motivations of the first person is have a good time with friends and explore all the forest , but hte motivation of the second person is pass a good time reading in the high of the mountain .
The first person will agree that the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guide , but the second person will agree that the best way to travel is been alone , without guide .
For me this example ilustrated my point .
This statement depend directly for the motivations or the intentions of the trip .
I could n't decided until I can figurate why I want make this trip .

Perhaps I decided that the decision depend of your motivations , most of the time I choose travel in group and in my experience a enjoy a lot when I travel in group .
For me is great go with my friends to other contries to explore .
This is my experience but in conclusion I agree with this statemen : `` The best way to travel is travel that are accomplish with your motivations '' .

If you have experienced this case , It is because of a drastic advertisement .
People who live in modern world are members of capitalistic societies .
An advertimest has a role of making consumers buy its product .
So , I think that advertisements usually make people overestimate the prices of products .
It is because of the purpose of advertisements , the models of advertisements , and the indirect feature of advertisements .

First of all , I think the purpose of advertisements is the important reason to make people misjudge products .
The roles of advertisments are to urge consumer to buy everything the companies sell .
In order to fulfill their goals , companies is going to whatever they can do .
Therefore , most companies merely want to emphasize the good aspect of their products .
As a result , products look better than they pratically are .

Secondly , I believe that the models of advertisements make products look much better .
Usually , most advertisements tend to hire famous stars , sport players , and any super stars as their models .
People can believe whatever super stars say in advertisements because super starts so famous that people regard them as reliable humans .
So , Using super stars for advertisements is another reason for overestimating .

Thirdly , It is obvious that people ca n't esimate any products directly by advertisements .
Through any advertisements , everything look good all the time .
However , all aspects of the products are indirect experiences .
People ca n't touch , use , smell , hold and even see directly through any advertisements .
Therefore , it makes products look better to consumers .

Most people live in capitalistic society .
Every company wants to make consumer buy their items by its advertisement .
because of the purpose of its , the models , and indirect feature of a advertiment , people can overestimate the qualities of products .

2030,350570.txt,P8,HIN,high,"Successful prople try new things and take risks and not just confining themselves to fields they already know .
They do use their existing knowledge to try new things .
Using their existing expertise they develop courage and bent of mind to look into new aspects and find out the new things .

Successful people try new things .
They look into other aspects and do not fear from looking deeper into that .
Every body knew that apple falls towards earth but only Einstein aked the question `` WHY '' and dared to find out the reality .
He didnt simply accept that things are like this .
He investigated into this and today we have the explanation for many phenomena based on his theory only .

Today we have many technological advancements going on .
Many scientists are working on those findings .
If these scientists had not taken the risk of exploring new things we would have been still in the same state as our ancestors .
These scientists were successful as they tried new things and worked hard to find them .

All the discoveries owe their allegiance to successful scientists who tried to find new things .
Had the columbus not set on a sail to prove the earth is round he would not have discovered a new country .

Success always favours those who take risks .
Industrialisation is occuring at rapid pace .
Persons setting them up are not neccessory technocrats .
But they want to try new things and hence taking risks .
Ideas are no one 's property .
Every one can think new and work for them .
But only those who beleive in them and work on them are successful .
They work and gain the expertise slowly .
The fear of being getting failed and not taking risks cannot bring success .
If a child doesnot take the risk of running he will never become good athlete .
All the successful businessmen are there as they tried new things that were later on accepted by the whole society .

At the same time some may say that if a person works on what he knows he will be more successful .
This is true to some extent but in the same field also he needs to think differenly and try new things .
If a persn continues to work on what he knows , he will not be able to expand his horizon of knowledge .
To gain perfection also he needs to try new things and take the risks .

Thus it can be said that for success in any field whether known or not there is need to try new things nad take risks .
The fear of being failure and not looking at new aspects can not bring success .

3643,634426.txt,P4,ITA,medium,"I think that the greatest part of advertisements give an idea of the product that is not true .
Industries are only focused on their business , on money and for this reason they are able to do anything .
In addition I would like to put in evidence the fact that sometimes annuncements are realized in a particular way aimed to provide not real characteristics or trying to hide other ones .

Clearly I belive that statments are developed only after a deep and long period of studying and reflection about which can be the better advertisement , the proper way of underlying something .

Moreover i belive that sometimes theese kind of statements do n't make sense .
For example , some years ago my family decided to buy a new bike and we considered differents opportunities .
After a few , we thought to have the just product for our needs .
We watched that bike during a programme on tv .
It was fantastic all of my family desired to have one of that incredible bicycle with that cool color .
Suddenly we decided to phone and we had to wait for two weeks .
We were waiting anxiously , imagining what we could do with the new bike , when it arrived .
Immediately we tried it .
I cannot explain how much astoniced and alo worried we began we at the first curve my father broken the wheel .
It was incredible but it happened .
In that moment all of us realized why that bike was so cheap .
From that moment I do n't belive in any kind of advertise since I ca n't see and test a product by my self .
Concluding I would like to suggest to every one to follow my advertisement , in this way we can oblige industries to realize true annuncement .

Some people are young , and others are old .
Sometimes , we can hear that older people say to young prople `` I envy you because you are enjoying your life so much . ''
However , I doubt the idea which young people enjoy their lives more than older people .
As far as I am concerned , they are too busy to enjoy their lives because young people have a lot of responsibilities to have to do .

First , young people have to study for their future .
For example , high school students in Korea spend over 15 hours to study every day .
In my case , I have been studied Toefl over 10 hours a day after I decided to go a university abroad .
Do you think that we seem to enjoy our lives ?

Second , young people have to earn money hardly to support their children .
One of my friends hate his job .
He is working as engineer , but he actual dream is to be a writer for novel .
However , he can not quit the job becuase his son was just born last year .
He does n't think that he can afford his family doing what he really wants .
How sad it is !

Finally , young people a lot of concerns about their future .
For example , according a research , 80 % of Korean junior high school students answer that they are not happy to the question '' Are you happy ? '' because they get tons of stresses from study and feel nervous about their futures .
It is not diffrent for people who work after graduating school .
Many people are not satisfied with their lives and are worried about their future .
They are young ; it means they have a lot of difficulties for the future for them .

Therefore , I ca n't agree with the idea which young people enjoy their life more than older people .
Actually , I belive that they could more enjoy they lives when they get older after they are done on their responsibilities .

9642,1556590.txt,P1,ARA,medium,"I am writing this compositon to argue about the statment that says `` Is it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject '' .
In the next paragraphs I am going to state the advantages of having broad knowledge in many acedemic subjects and the disadvantages of it .

Every single person all around the world wants to be a person with knowledge a person who has a good average and all the family is proud to have a person like that .
Studying many subjects in school and in university and getting low marks is useless there would be only one advantage and that is that this person will show that he is able to study so many subjects at once .

On the other hand side .
there are many disadvantages of having broad knowledge in so many subjects .
First of all studying physics chemistry along with business and economics needs both learning and thinking , i do not think that there is a person who is able to study these subjects together .
Studying all these subjects will not make a person work in a company which has engineering combined with journalism .
A person can only work in one of these companys .

Almost all the people who work in companys now graduated from universities and all of these people studied a specific subject .
Studying a subject you are an expert in is much better than studying many subjects that you are not good in .
Many people who study many subjects are doing that just to get more money , these people should know that money is not more important than having a job which you are expert in , and at the same time you are enjoying yourself in this company .
Another reason a person would want to have this knowledge in many subjects would be that this person just wants to show off infront of friends and family that he is working in two companys at once .
My cousin was one of those people that wanted to have broad knowledge in so many subjects and he suffered a lot studying in university .
On the other hand his brother studied Finance only and now his brother is happier than him in his work and he is also getting a higher salary .

I disagree about this statement `` having broad knowledge in many subjects is better than specializing in one subject '' .
I think specializing in one subject is much better and i advise every single person who is planning to study many subjects to think before making this desicion because nothing is more important than your future .

6568,1075178.txt,P4,KOR,medium,"I agree to the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
I will explain the reasons why .
First , the purpose of advertisements is to make people buy or consume those products .
To accomplish this purpose , the weaknesses of the products should be hided and the strengths of them must be emphasized .
For example , in an TV advertisement for a medicine used for impotence , the people makes that advertisement try to persuade people with impotence by using different stimulations such as visual signals and sounds .
When I watch it , I think I should try some day even I do n't have that problem .
They comment some side effects at the end of the advertisement in very fast speed and use ambiguous words such as `` may '' , `` some '' , `` rare '' or `` most '' .
Second , through advertisements , the qualties of the products will be exaggerated because the producers of the products try to beat their competitors .
Let 's think about the competition between coca cola and pepsi cola .
They use different advertisement strategies to beat their competitors .
They add nice-smelling cherry flavor to attract the people like sweet taste .
They develop a low calorie cola named `` diet coke '' or `` diet pepsi '' even these products do not contribute reducing weight .

In conclusion , I agree to the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

11054,1811066.txt,P1,DEU,high,"I think that the question to either have a broad knowledge of a variety of subjects or to have a good and specialised understanding in one subject is a difficult one .
I agree with both of the points to some extent .
First of all , it is important for a younger student to have a broad knowledge of many subjects .
Schools , in particular primary and secondary schools should try and give their students a broader overview of many subjects .
This is also important in the younger years of a students life , because most of the students have not decided what they will do in their future life .
They are not really sure what they are really interested in and in what area they want to specialize .
When it comes to secondary schools , students should be given their first choices , based on the knowledge they haev already obtained .
They should be able to limit their subject choice and cut down on the number of areas where they have to study in .
Of course , this would also result in deepening the knowledge in the subjects chosen .
When it comes to the last two to three years of school for students , they should be given lessons in only the six to seven areas they are really interested in .
Whereas , I think that certain subjects do not even have to be taken .
Currently , Mathematics , German , a second language , History or Politics and Biology , Chemistry or Physics have to be studied .
I think this is not needed , as different students of course have different strength , not only in life , but also in their academics .
I have attended a German `` Gymnasium '' until Year 10 , where we were not able to make any choices whatsoever .
Studying 16 to 18 subjects was not an exception .
I have also attended an Australian school , only studying 5 subjects .
The coice was widely open and no Mathematics or languages or any subjetcs were required to be able to do your exams at the end and gain university entrance .
However , for certain university courses , students also had to take certain school courses .
One such example would be Medecine , where students had to have Biology and Chemistry , as well as taking the UMAT test , to see if they are suitable for such a course and also later on such a job .
I think this is a successful approach for students , which not only gives them the motivation they need in school , but also the requirements to successful results at the end of their school time .
On the side , we also have university students who have to be taken under consideration .
Of course they are a different matter altogether .
I hold the opinion that the less subjects they take and the deeper they go into details in their study , the better it is .
At the beginning of a three to four year study period for their first degree in that area , university students should get a bit of a broader overview of the area for one to two semesters .
In that period of time , they get the time needed to see what specifically they want to do and with what exactly they want to continue .
The rest of the remaining study period , university students should be prepared for exactly the field they are interested in and want to get a working place later on .
This is neccessary to make sure that every one of the students is really good at what they are doing and can prepare well for their choice of job .
This would give the university students not only more choices from which they can choose their courses , but it would also prepare them better for what they will do later in their life .
It would also be a positive criteria for employers when they take people , because then they can be sure that they know what the person is doing and that the person knows as much as possible about what he or she is doing and also the background information that is needed .
Time and money is saved as well , as people come into the workforce and do not have to get an introduction how everything works over a long period of time .
Therefore , I would say that there is not a totally clear answer to the question , but the tendency in the later years of education for me is towards a specialization in one , maybe two subjects .

9828,1590216.txt,P4,DEU,high,"The development of mass media was the beginning of a new era of avertisement .
Virtually all companies make use of advertisement using the possibilities given by the new forms of mass media as for example the TV or the internet .
I agree with the statement that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

First reason for my point of view is economical .
Given the fact that firms take their decisions on the basis of rationality there has to be an economical icentive for them to invest in advertisement .
And so it 's quite obvious that the firms intend to increase their sales by the way of advertizement .
And the consumers are now buying more from the firm 's product for one simple reason .
The firm 's product seems to them much better than it really is .
And the firms knowing this fact make use of this by advertizing .

Another argument is psychological .
I personally have made the experience that the way one consider the value of certain objects is highly influenced by the way that other people talk about these objects .
For example , once most of my friends bought a new video game .
And whereas I had n't liked this certain game a short time before , from this moment on getting this game seemed to be the most important thing in the world .
And this process is now linked to the effects of advertisement , because the advertisement for a lot of products is made by very popular people like a tennis star or show master of an TV show .
And this effects how people think about the products .
The product seems in most cases much better than it really is .

Even if advertisement often conveys true information about a product awakening the interest of the people .
I believe that there is mostly a strong effect influencing the people in a way , so that there is difference between the true value of a product and the value the people think .
And this means that there takes place an alienation of the peoples preferences .
And from an economical point of view this ca n't be good for the welfare of the society .

302,54377.txt,P3,DEU,high,"Unfortunately I do not spend much time helping my community , but I admire everyone who does it and try to support these people in other ways ( e.g. donations ) .
There are many reasons for young pepole to spend time helping their community .
Some of them are listed below .

On the one hand a commonly held view is that there is a growing solitude within our society an young people are looking for a family an friends .
In Germany every second marriage is being divorced and many children grow up in torn families .
But as children need support and a person they can admire and they can identifiy with , they sometimes look for this support outside their family .
Therefore , there should be a growing number of young people joining organisations as the red cross or the local fire department .

On the other hand , one has to constate that there is a growing lack of time that hinders young people to join these organizstions .
Due tu a sharpening competition within society and due to a sinking number of job offerings , children and young people might be forced to qualifiy on a vide range of sectors .
In order to get a got job nowadays , you have to be excellently educated , speak 2 languages , have a lot of job expererience , be very young and pass at minimum one year abroad .
As a consequence it seems more attractive for young people to spend their time maximizing their chances of getting a good job than to spend time helping their communities .

Another point to consider is that helping community often goes with a job which is not only requiring time but which is also not paid .
It seems easier to do a job in a company .
In a company you get paid for your work and it might be useful for your curriculum vitae having worked for that company .
Nevertheless , our society needs people who work volunteerently in order to support their community .
When your house burns you will be glad that some people work volunteerently for the lokal fire department , even though it is not useful for their curriculum vitae .

To sum up , there are various reasons for young pepole to give or to not give time to helping their communities .
My view is that there are still enough young people being engaged for their community and doing this for a number of different reasons .
As this work is very important for a society you should be very grateful these people spend their time helping their communities .

There are three advantages .
First , as you traveling in a group led by a tour guide , tour guide will let you know every single thing you need to see in the journey .
For example , if you want to go sightseening , a tour guide will escort you to the sight .
The tour guide will be resopnsible whatever traveler wants to do .
They just don ' have to worry about reserving the resturant or doing some speacial activities .
Espeacialy when they cannot speak English or German or whatever the languages are spoke in the country where they travel to .
Second , since go traveling with group , they will definately get along with each other and have fun .
If traveling alone , it wo n't be able to have much fun as traveling with group .
Third , traveling a gourp with a tour guide is much more safer than traveling alone .
Of course a tour guide knows about the location where is not safe enough to go so they wo n't go to the dangerous side of city .

Ever since transportations developed amagingly , the world gets closer .
We can go to the another side of world by airplane in ten hours or it may take a day to get there .
It used to take about two , three months to get to the other countires .
The world is getting more dangerous , most of people have guns and knife .
so traveling with a tour guide is very helpfull to the traveler .

In my experienses , I have gone to Australia by my own .
It was still scary to go there by self .
Espeacialy in town side .
When I went to town , I lost my wallet .
i did n't lose my passport , thougt .

4923,859305.txt,P1,JPN,medium,"Although it is good to specialize in one subject , I agree with the opinion that people have to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
First , even if you are interested in that one subject you study , you had better to see other subjects .
Seeing other ranges will be helpful to enlarge your knowledge .
If you see many things and read many kinds of books , your brain and feelings will be soft and you can learn more things than before .

Secondly , it will also help you to make it sure what you have learned .
In one way , you can not know what is correct or not because your sight is narrow and small .
If you learned something about the one specific subject , you can not say that in other subject the same .
You have to see it from many ways or you can not judge it .

And also , all academic subjects connect to each subject .
We exist in this world and many materials exist together in a complex way as well .
Although each subject might look different at all , in fact , they are telling us about this world .
Unexpectedly , all subjects are same things .

In sum , I support the opinion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects with those three reasons after all .

Of course , to know a lot costs time and energy .
It 's a provement of one 's ability .
If one does have broad knowledge but not specialize in any subjects , does it good for him or her ?
I do n't think so .

If one has broad knowledge of many academic , he or she would n't have enough time to specialize in any of the subjects as the human-being 's ability and energy are limited .
But the fact is , most people should or would have works in a certain period of time .
A certain work needs one to own a specific ability to solve certain problems .
That means the one who have lots of knowledge of many subjects ca n't do anything at all .
Their knowledge are too superficial to deal with any problems .
So this kind of people are likely to loose their jobs as their knowledge ca n't help anything .
They are like some old-fashion liberaries .

Another inefficiency is that they do n't gain as much satifactory feeling as the people who are specialize in one specific subject .
Their broad knowledge may come from books , lectures or internet .
But they just recite the things which are provided by others .
They ca n't make up anything or develope any ideas as they spend all their times in searching other 's comments or points of view .
In contrast , the people who are specialize in one specific subject can think of ideas they are interested in more thoroughly and deeply than others .
They may gain something by their own .
We all know that creation can make one pride and content .
Of course , repeating others ' things ca n't be called creation .
So the people who have broad knowledge can never feel this kind of feelings .

What I mean is not to suggest people to study only one subjects .
To know many things can bring benefits to us .
But at the same time , you should specialize in one subject or you 'll find there is nothing you could do in the future .

Factors make students to face on the reality , help students to understand ideas and concepts better , and make student more attention about the field .

One of reasons I desagree with this idea is because students should know the reality .
If students just study about ideas and concepts , they can never lean what is going on in the real world .
For example , in business class , students will learn about stocks .
If students do not do a similation game of marketing stocks , they will never know how it is diffecult to guess what is going to happen next one second .
Facts help students to learn the real world by themselves .

In addition , if students learn many facts , it is going to help students to understand ideas and concepts more .
For instance , in business class again , through a similation game of marketing stocks , students understand what stocks are about , why companies have stocks , and so on better .
It is more effective than just learning ideas and concepts .

Finally , learing through facts can make students to be interested in that field .

I had never been interested in business at all untill I did a similation game .
I knew the facts of business world and it caught my mind somehow .
Besides , I am majoring in business in college now .
There are more studets who had the same experience .

In conclusion , It is better to learn more about facts than ideas and concepts .

It is also important to understnd ideas and concepts .
It is just learning facts is more important than understanding ideas and concepts .

3922,680557.txt,P1,TUR,medium,"The way of doing academic researches is always developing and dividing into new branches throughout many years .
As scientific and technologic innovation develops very fast , things to be researched are getting more complex and hard .
Due to this , academic subjects are increasing and their context are complicated .
In my opinion , specializing in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects for several reasons .

First of all , by specializing in one academic topic you have the opportunity to discover new things in science .
When you are interested in a specified topic deeply , it is possible to consider the details carefully .
For instance , human genome project is divided into several groups and every scientific group researches a detailed part of the project .
By doing this , they can rapidly get results and combine them .

Secondly , working with specific subjects gives you the chance of developing new scientific groups and working in coordination .
Research groups have the opportunity to study properly and organized .
If one scientist have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , he can not afford to concern with all problems and fails .

Consequently , specializing in one subject for academic researches is important to the development of science and technological innovation .
As we share the problems , we will be succesful quickly .

The role of media has reached its zenith in this age .
Right from a common daily-need item like a toothpaste , to a something more in vogue like a new designer brand apparel , or of technical importance like a new TV , a automobile , or a Computer-all need the media to make them appealing , or to lure people to buy them-irrespective of whether or not people need them .
Infact , these advertisements `` create a need '' rather than catering to the needs of those who are in the process of making a decision on something they already need to buy .

Advertisements , more than often , project a product in a way that the actual effect of the product advertised falls short of the description !
For example , the advertisements on body creams project such flawless , smooth , enticing bodies , although when used , they do not caste the same glow and charisma to the bodies of those who use them !
Another example is of a stain removers .
Most of them are ineffective , and if they are effective , they ruin the very color of the garment itself along with the stain .
What is annoying is the way they are romanticisedLet aside the ideas presented in which using it would mean adding romance to a moment , or finding the right guy !
Such deceptions of adding extra charm to a product entices buyers .

Advertisements cast a halo around an item , adding glamor to it by choosing attractive models to sell for them .
People , especially younger generation to be more precise , get very affected by looks-outer appearance .
They tend to copy models and movie stars etc .
They are in an age that is very influential .
When these individuals watch their favorite model seeling for something , their first impulse is to buy that item .
In the process , they seldom realize whether the product is worth it or not .
At times it is of no use what-so-ever .
For instance , recently there was an advertisement that flashed on the TV screens , which was unnecessarily glamorized , although the product was anything but glamorous or flashy .
It was an advertisement for a pain relieving pill !
Is it necessary to romanticise something like a pain reliever ?
And who is being targetted ?

Unfortunately , the more vulnerable part of the society-the younger generation becomes a victim .
In my view , such deceptions are harmful .
They do nothing to bulid a society , rather making it dependant on items people would never have needed otherwise .
This does n't mean that advertisements do n't have their place at all .
But if they are more discriminative in their depiction , it would be more fair .

In my opinion , old people can enjoy life as the younger ones do .
In fact , older people enjoy a lot of free time which they can use to take part in various leisure activities .
For example pensioners have a lot of time which they can use to travel not depending on their company or school vacations which makes their travel more relaxing and their destinations less crowded .

Furthermore , a majority of the elderly possess large amounts of money which they can spend on their hobbies .
Having probably paid off most of their debts and not being forced to raise their children anymore they can use their savings for themselves .
For example , older people can buy goods which they have always dreamed of while the younger ones still have to work and save money .

Additionally , As medical treatments are more and more developed , the older people can still enjoy their lives by continuing to do sports , improving their quality of life and health .
For instance , compared to drugs in the past there are more soft treatments , suppressing the disadvantages of the aging process by using hormones , enabling them to do many sports the younger ones can do , too .

Lastly , more and more products and services for the elderly are created , making their daily life more enjoyable .
Older peolpe are seen as `` Silver Market '' by several industries , being offered many products developed exclusively for them just like group travels in which people of the same age meet and explore foreign countries .

All in all I think that I have shown that being old does not mean that older people cannot enjoy life .
They might even be able enjoy life a little bit more than the younger ones do .
"
4514,785164.txt,P2,TUR,high,"Do the elderly enjoy life as the young do ?

From a psychological standpoint , it can ben claimed that the way people perceive the world changes as they get older .
In other words , they get more realistic as years pass .
Thus , I am inclined to believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

To start with , younger people expect more from life , and , to a great extent , people believe in the possibility of realizing their dreams in younger ages .
As a resut , this inner drive makes people to enjoy the life in all means , since they feel that they still have time to do what they want to do .
However , as they get older , they start to think that they will never be able to be the person that they have dreamt of .

Secondly , younger people have the energy that is needed to enjoy the life .
That is to say , they do not have to worry about their health situation while thinking about an activity .
For example , it is almost impossible for older people to attend activities that need more energy and attention such as surfing , rafting , and skiing .

On the other hand , some people claim that older peple enjoy life more than young people do , since they have more time than the young .
In other words , they do not have to worry about anything else apart from making themselves feeling better , and enjoying the life .
However , this argument can be considered as right only for a small percentage of the elderly , since they are not even able to find someone to accompany them for most of the time .

Taking these points into consideration , obviously , young people have more opportunity , and chance to enjoy life when compared to the old .
However , I strongly believe that this situation can be improved in the future for the advantage of the elderly .
"
9536,1537208.txt,P2,HIN,medium,"I do agree with the statment that young people enjoy their life more than an older person .
Every individual in more efficient , strong and lively in the earlier span of life , so its quite obvious that anyone with a wish to enjoy , can really enjoy life at the maximum in his/her early age .

Also one main aspect is the responsibility and work load .
These are the two important features that an old individual has truck load on him/her but a young personnel hardly carry such loads .
They are least with the responsibilities and in turn have a handful time to put in something interesting and adventerous .

Other major reason for young to enjoy is that young age is considered to be the `` age of moulding '' , thus he tries to learn more and more of the things which in itself is an interesting affair because gaining anything new is always fun , even though at times it might be leading to the wrong side of the track , but here we are discussing about enjoying life , so anyone in this young age could easily deviate to a path which might be misleading but still enjoying while on the other hand , an old individual is prone to be afraid of going for something new as he has a lot of responsibilities on him and would have to think about it a hundred times before going for it , so he usually sticks to the orthodox schedule which make make him further more reluctant for going for fun filled part .

But everywhere its not that they dont have the oppourtunity to enjoy instead many-a-times they sacrifice their pleasure for their young ones to enjoy as they also feel that they already have had enough and now its their young ones ' turn to capitalize on the life .

In the end , we can conclude that for many physical and mental reasons old people enjoy considerably less than the young ones .
"
9972,1617101.txt,P2,DEU,high,"You often see old people on the street who are either angry , annoyed or very sad .
By contrast most of the young people I know are very cheerful and relaxed .
Apparently , most of the young people are much happier than older ones .
Therefore , I personally believe that young people enjoy their lives more than older people .

Evidently , older people have more maladies and painful physical problems .
The body gets weaker when you become older and often causes horrible pains .
Generally speaking , children and younger people are healthier and consequntly fitter .
My grandfather for instance , had belly cancer and therefore did n't relish eating anymore .
Being traumatized by horrible memories , many old people get more and more depressed in their old age .
This causes difficulties that force old people to renounce many pleasures in life .
For example , it becomes more and more difficult to travel .

In addition , younger people still have a lot of wishes and ideas of what they want to accomplish and experience in life .
Whereas old people tend to be frustrated because there is nothing new to discover .
They have experienced nearly everything in life and do n't have any future plans .
Young boys and girls can look forward and are still full of hope , whereas older people must look backward .

In conclusion , I personlly believe that it is much easier to be happy when you are young .
On the one hand , being young and fresh normally leads to a happier life because the body is generally fitter and painless .
On the other hand , a child or teenager still has the opportunity to discover many things in life .
Given all of these reasons , I recommend everyone to learn and experience as many things as possiple during his youth , since for most of the pleasures in life it will be too late one day

8733,1378204.txt,P7,ITA,medium,"I agree with the statement , I think that for the students is more important understand ideas and concepts , because when a person understand ideas ( he or she ) can applicate this in real life or can teach to ather people that concept .
But I think also that for understand better ideas or concepts a person must learn facts , bacause facts rappresent a great example about ideas .
At school students study a lot , for example , history because this subject is very important for understand a lot of today things from the past mistake .

If you know the human history you can do the best choise , but a lot of students stady the history but sometime they ca n't understand the real meaning of things that they have just read on the book .
For this reason , for me , it is very important learn ideas , because not all people can interpretate in the right way the facts .
It is much faster study a fact then understend correctly concepts .
The real problem about this learning metod is that there is n't a single way to interpretate facts , all people have a different mind and not always they give the right sense to things .
A professor can interpretate in wrong way a fact and tell to his students wrong things .

9692,1566515.txt,P8,ARA,medium,"Successful people are full of life and they are always ready to learn new things , either to improve their professional or personal lives .
In their professional life , for instance , they are continuously trying to be on the top by not accepting only the paper adhered to them by the company .
Rather , they starve to learn new things because discovering a new life is often advantageous .
In general , successful people do not fear being exposed to new things in their life because it is their way of living .
Just to give an example , a successful people may work in different companies or in the same company but changing their activities .
In so doing , they improve both their personal and professional lives .
As a result they become men of a lot of experiences in life .
Sometimes , you even find them working for a company and studying a career .
This is good for them since it allows them to have better jobs , after all , there is a very high competition in our professional life .
On the contrary , people who do not want to experience new things normally lead one-style life .
For example , an accountant may spend his lifetime as so not trying to have another profession .
This attitude limits his possibility to learn more about life

9128,1453127.txt,P7,SPA,medium,"Well as a student I will say and understanding is basic not matter if is and idea concepts or a fact , the point is all depens if is for a comon use or for a class , or living .

What I try to say is all are important to undestand , what difers is who we use sometimes is better to have the idea of something becouse it let us our mine opend to descover more and undestand better becouse is how we undestand or persive the idea .
When we have a concepts is not much that we can change becouse is that way it is exemple a concept of a anatomy where blood are red cells , is not much that we can change we leran like that .
Now if we talk about facts is something proved by cientific laws , gravity is a fact .

As a student we need to accept some information as idea where can be personal or toughts form someone , concepts where we need to learnd , and facts .
I thing the diference in all is facts you can not change , concept you can learn in diferent ways and finally understand , and ideas is what you creeat , form something you see , you hear or feel , and can be change .

Facts , concepts and ideas are importan for a student , not matter what is study ,

For sure the person that study chimestry facts are every where , and it may be learn and no so well undestud , and other case a person that study politic science , what matters more are the ideas how interpres tha concepts , and maybe for someone that study biology concepts are really important and must to be undestud .

For more or less , Ideas concepts and facts are importan when we are learning , I thing how it works is we get the idea , then we analize then we undestand .
wether is a idea , concept or a fact .
"
8378,1311489.txt,P7,SPA,high,"I completely agree with this statement .
There is no point in knowing facts without capturing the essence of the ideas .
This applies to all fields of study .
As a civil engineering student in Mexico City I had to learn many formulas and techniques to solve many problems .
We would concentrate mainly on structural design , having to learn to apply these methods by heart .
There was not much sence in learning the formula because in the real world we are able to open a book .
The real important part came when we had to understand the effects and the causes that interact with the structure at study .
A good engineer is the one that really understands the structural behavior of what he is building .

The same applies to a history student .
There is no point in knowing all the exact dates of historical events if there is no understandig of the essence of the study .
What good would it do if the student does not have a feel on how a culture lived , what they ate or what they thought which lead to the historical event .
The dates will stay in almanacs forever but the real learning comes from understandig the ideas and the concepts .

Schools today tend to lean towards a more understanding way of teaching .
They focus mainly on atracting the student 's attention by taking them on field trips or by having more interactive materials to teach with .
Computers and the internet help to visualize and understand concepts that would have been difficult to explain without them .
There are also easier ways to obtain factual information now than before .
This makes it almost useless for a student to learn the facts .
They have to focus on understanding the ideas and be able to apply their knowledge in real life .
The only way to do so is by having the right education .

In my opinion , young people are quite naiv and not realy aware of their environnement .

While competing with other companies , companies tend to make their products look better in their advertisements .
I agree the fact that most advertisements make products look much better than they really are , but I do n't disagree with the way companies do it .

The same as a movie preview , the director always want to show the most exciting part of the movie .
Companies tend to skip the inconviency and disadventige of their product .
Instead , they always show the best of their products .
Sometimes , the companies will use special editing and filming skills to make their product look even better .
For example , when the new I-Pod nano first came out in the comercial , people were amazed by its pretty disign and how small it was .
However , buyers soon realized that the I-pod nano was very easy to be scrached .
Moreover , the I-Pod nano has a very small menmory compare to other I-Pods .
The funny thing is that I bought a I-Pod nano right after i saw the comertial .
Of course , the nano was not as exciting as the ones in comertial , but it was not much worse .

However , I was really angry when i saw the first scrach mark on my I-Pod nano .

7072,1121083.txt,P7,TUR,high,"The aim of the modern education is not making the students learn or memorize the facts .
Instead , it is introducing them ideas and concepts .
Teaching ideas and concepts will make the students understand the underlying reasons behind the facts .
They will gain a broad vision which is based on ideas and concepts .
Through this vision they can understand and eveluate facts in a more comprehensive manner .
It is more important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn the facts because it is more meaningful and more practical .

First of all , without ideas and concepts facts are not meaningful .
The ideas and and concepts make the facts meaningful .
For example without knowing the ideas and concepts of early twentieth century it is not possible to understand First World War .
The dominant political idea was nationalism which resulted in the deep hostilities amng the nations .
There are concepts such as imperialism , struggle for market expansion etc .
Without understanding these ideas and learning these concepts one can only memorize the chronolgy of the war but can not understand it properly .

Secondly , it is much more practical to make students learn concepts and ideas rather than facts .
It is impossible to make a student to learn all the facts .
But if he or she is given a theoratical perspective based on ideas and concepts , he would be able to evoluate facts that he faces .
Ideas and concepts would turn out to be useful tools in h 's hands to interprit the facts .
The facts are written in the books .
If one needs to use them he can open a book and read it .
It is very easy .
For this reason it is not practical to learn them by heart .

It is better first to forge a theoratical framework with ideas and concepts then evoluate events in this framework .
It is both more meaningful and more practical .

7392,1149918.txt,P4,DEU,high,"Advertisement is the product of highly sophisticated marketing techniques combined with the knowledge of the human psychology .
Knowing how to advertise under these references makes it easy for companies to sell products that look very appealing but in actual fact are not their money 's worth .
Throughout the history of industries , stores and products there have been unthinkable numbers of faltey and bad products that have consumed the markets and their customers in a raid .

For the famous company Apple who have produced and advertised an array of incredible products , there have been some along the way that were purely insignificant in contrast to their price .
The first release of their Ipod was one of these products .
When the Ipod was primarily released , the sales numbers hit a continuoes high that has not ended till today , but these `` first year '' Ipods were full of technicall errors .
The Ipod batteries ( that were concealed in the inside of the Ipod ) broke after two weeks and lasted for an hour when they were maximum charged .
Since the Ipod is one of the highest produced gadgets in the world , this problem occured with every Ipod within a few weeks of it 's purchase .
Second , the Ipod headphones that came with it , blew out after listening to music the music with the maximum volume on your own Ipod .
This was a big issue , since this showed that the headphones were not designed accordingly .

Although all of these faults were known , the Ipod sales did not decrease because it was the most prestigious gadget to own at the time .
The design and marketing strategies led by Steve Jobs ( Apple 's CEO ) have influenced such emense groups of customers , from all ages to all places that the sales did not decrease .
The fantastic and slik design contributed to this .
The Ipod was three to four hundred dollers at the time and compared to other Mp3 players that were less expensive , it was not of higher standards and therefor not worth the money .

The marketing strategies that evolve around the advertisments of new products exceeds the basic knowledge we have about a product and makes it look of higher standards than it is .
The products therefor are sold at prices that they are not worthy of and therefor corrupt the average customers payments .
It is unfair but at the same time the customers fault for not researching the products enough before they purchase them .

11390,1872730.txt,P1,DEU,medium,"In my opinion it is in general better when you have a broad knowledge of academic subjects .

Firstly , in many academic subjects , you need a overview about several topics to understand the relationship within one topic and between different themes .
I study economics at the University of Applied Sciene in Nuremberg .
For example in Finance I have to know the theoretic basics in Finance but I also need the knowledge of mathematics , tax and law .
So I am not only specified on one subject .
During the semster , we have many differnt subjects which all stands in relationship to economics .
For example , marketing , finance , law , tax , accouting .
english , general mangament etc .

Secondly , it is not sure , that someone always get a job in that subject that he has studied .
So it is possible , that he had studied Finance but now works in a marketing department .
The situation on tte work market is not so good and so it is better to have a broad knowledge .
My friend studied logistics and now he is working as banker , but while his studytime he must vistited lectures of finance and assurance .
So he has not that problems to work in this field .

But there are also subjects in which it is better , when you are specified .
For instance in medical : It is not possible , that every doctor knows everything .
You need someone for skin deases but also someone who has knowlegde about cancer .
In this case it is of advantage , when you have a specific knowledge .
On the other hand it so for the human brain impossible all to know .

In a conclusion it is to say , that it depends on the subject and how deep the subect is related to others .
On the one hand it can be better to have a wide knowledge , on the other hand it can be useful to be specialise in one academic field .

9083,1445771.txt,P7,ARA,medium,"I agree with this statement for allot of reasons and arguments .
The first reason for this statement why its important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts is because its so much important to understand it then learning it and forgetting about it in the future .
The main idea for this statement is a student has to understand wats he 's learning because it helps him in lots of ways instead of just helping him in one day just to get it over with and done .
Me as myself its better for me to understand it then to learn it and not know it .
I think its better for a teacher or a proffesor to explain wat he or she is talking about exactly instead of writing and writing on a board and the students not understanding a thing .
Its better if he or she ( teacher ) goes in details and explains everything for the students so the students will actually understand the topic and what there talking about .
The idea 's the teacher give students are really important for them because they 'll get and idea of the topic i mean the main idea and the concept of it .

In conclusion of all this i agree with this statement because of allot of stuff such as what i said for example its better for students to learn what the teacher is actually talking about then just learning the facts of it , because the facts will not take u anywhere becuase you will forget them but in the other hand learning the idea 's and the concepts and actaully understanding it is much better for the student so he wont have any difficulties in the past about the main topic given in class .
So thats about it about whats important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

6466,1065347.txt,P6,JPN,medium,"I desagree with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
I have several reasons why I think so .
First , travel lad by a tour guide is titely scheduled so you are not allowed to spend time freely .
As a result of it , you can not experience the real life of the people who live in the place you visit .
Tour guides show you only what they want you to see .
There are many other places you should visit to understand local peoples life .
For example , the houses they actually live or parks local children gather in , not the places such as famous temples or historic buildings .

Second , it is better to travel alone than being in a group .
To travel with your friends may make you feel relaxed , but , especially in the case of going abroad , you can learn how to deal with troubles by yourself .
It will make you tough and much more self-confident .
It is true that traveling in a group led by a tour guide banefit you much in terms of seculty and safety , but one of the most important things you can learn from traveling is to acquire the ability to handle the problem even if you are in a strange place .

Third , traveling in a group led by aguid tour is passive .
If you go abroad , it is bettter to study the language that local people speak .
Language can not be separated from calture so in you would really like to understand its culture , you need to learn their language too .

11596,1906708.txt,P3,ZHO,high,"People respond to this issue differently .
In my opinion , I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping thier communities .
As a young girl , I do n't think that I can give enough time to help my community .
Here comes some reasons .

First of all , young people nowadays have more vivid personalities than decades ago .
In this situation , young people try their best to be themselves and do everything they want to do .
So they may have fewer time and may be unwilling to helping their communities just because they think it is stupid or rediculous if they help thier communuties .
In other words , they think that helping their communitis is not the thing that a young man should do .
For example , young people in my country indicates that young people should go outside and try something new and exciting , not just stay at home or in communities .
Participating activities of communities is the thing that old people do .
Although this may not be a correct idea , it really influence you

In addition , as advanced technology is invented and applied , there are more and more activities that young people can do .
But we only have 24 hours a day and it led to a fewer time to hepling our communities in contrast .
For example , we can go see a movie or go riding , go kloofing , or even attand to a big computer game competition .
There are too many things for we young people to try and to experience .
That is , we can hardly get eough time helping our communities because there are more and more interesting and exciting activities that appeal to us .

To summarize , young nowadays really do n't give enough time to help their communities .
But this does n't mean that we do n't love our own community , afterall , there are too many things enchant us .
We have the right to participate an activity that is really interesting to us and this may help us to learn more and experience mor from it .

1947,336218.txt,P3,FRA,medium,"In our days , the young people seem to be concerned only by themselfes .
Between helping their community ortake care about themselfes , their choice is usually the same : do what they enjoy .
But people should not sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing ?
Do not the society provides also this behaviour ?
In our days , the society is one of leisure .
The most important thing is to have fun when you can do it during the sparetimes .
Young people live in another world , a world where everithings is possible and where everythings have to be funny .
As many adult do , young people do not take care about their environnement and also about the other people .
But it is an especially behaviour of young people or it is the most part of the population who do that ?
For me the probleme comes from the mentality .
They have changed .
Before we did not refused to help our neighbours and moreover that was perfectly normal .
Now , if somebody does that , it is like an miracle .
Why this change ?
Maybe due to the new dream of the life witch is to know the happiness or maybe it is only a losing of the closness between people hat we had .
Many possibilities are true but i thing the most importante one is that we changed into a society where we are more lonely and we do not like who we do not know Thus , I agree that young people do not give enought time to think about something else than them .
Although the conditions of living have changed as the mentality , I thinkit will be very harmful to become to individual .

3238,561155.txt,P7,FRA,high,"I globally agree with the quotation above even if I think that some precisions should be add up to complete it and make it more realistic .

First , the purpose of studying is to gain a rational mind so that you can apply it to resolve and analyse various issues .
Therefore , it is compulsory to be able to quickly understand concepts and ideas so that you can discuss them and give an opinion without necessary having any related knowledge .

In addition , facts are often the aftermath or the physical consequences of ideas or concepts .
In other words , facts convey ideas and concepts , that is why they are inevitably of a superior value .
For example , the Castro revolution in Cuba is a fact while the marxism ideology is the logic behind it .

Second , a reason that can explained why facts are sometimes seen as important or even more important than ideas is that facts are extremely efficient to convey an idea .
People are generally more receptive twhe they can link an idea to relevant fact and great speakers often uses facts and examples to support their saying .

Therefore , one could wrongly think that the message is more interesting when conveyed through facts whereas it is the combination of ideas and facts that makes it so appealing .

To conclude , there is no doubt about the superiority of ideas and concepts over facts .
However for a student to be successful in life , he or she needs to be able to link ideas to facts and point out the existing interactions between them .
I therefore think that the sentence should have been written like this : '' It is important for students to understand ideas an concepts first and then look for example of the aftermath of these ideas throughout the history '' .

The person health is every thaing to any person .
For example , if some one has a lot of money and some day he or she get sek because some thing and he or she can not do any thing because that in all his or her life , so he or she wo n't enjoy life any more .
Moreover , there are a lot of people who have a good health and they engjoy with their life because that , but they are a lot of people do not have a good health , so they do not enjoy with their life .
For example , if someone has a problem with his or her back he or she can not play football or walk for long way .
Who usually has big problems with their health ?
Young people have more health than older people .
Foe example , if someone go to any hospital , he or she will find a lot of older people in that hospital and some young people .
It is fact the Young people have best health than older .

I agree with that statment which it said young people are happy and funny more than who their age is more than 50 .
They are a lot of reasons and the health is one of them and it is most of them importent .
I disagree with that person who said all young people enjoy with thier life and that person who said there are no older people enjoy with their life .
They are , but they are not many .

2007,345667.txt,P8,KOR,medium,"Some people might say that try new things and take risks to suceed .
But i agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they alreay know how to do well .
Because those who are working like professional , they have confidece and dream when they work .

First of all , they are not always successful either they try new things or not .
I think the most important thing is confidence for success and without knowledges , it is hard to try new things and take risks .
For example , one of my friend studied economic but now he wants to transfer to art school .
Does not it make sense ?
he had not been drewing about 20 years , so that he gave up .
Like i said , when we try something new things , even we should have basic technic or knowledge .

In addition , we have to have dreams for our successful life .
There are so many people who try to new things without dream .
In my opinion , If we just work without dream , we need more time to suceed than peolple who have dream .
For instance , In korea , people try to suceed everyday .
But it is extremely hard to suceed , even they have skills .
Thus many koreans surrender their job then they have their own business and they are more successful in life than people who go to company everyday .

In conclusion , we all want to suceed .
But in order to suceed , we have to have confidence and dream in our mind and also we have to know how to do very well .
If we always try new things without know-how , we always might be behind .

7551,1164969.txt,P4,ITA,medium,"Today advertisement can convice consumers that every kind of product is the best one and that you ca n't live without it .
There are a lot of tecniques that make a product irresistible for consumers .
But is always true that all advertised products are so good like it seem to be ?
I think is not : they seem much better than they really are .
Last week I bought an apple pie that I saw on a television spot .
In the images reported on tv it seems realy testy and healthy , but when I eat it , it was not so good and I got sick .
I could n't sleep all night long .

In my opinion it would be better for food or dress companies to spend their budjet improving the quality of their products or decreasing the prices instead of invest it on advertisement .

The problem is that business rules are different from what is better for the people .
But something has to be done .
I think that certification of qulity are a very good investment for the companies to show the real value of their product end in the same time a good way for consumers to verify the quality of what they are buying and choice better between different brands .

11238,1843663.txt,P2,KOR,medium,"It is important that everybody enjoys their lives .
But who enjoys more , young people or older people ?
In my opinion , older people enjoys their lives more because they know what the true enjoyment and freedom to do anything .

Firstly , adults enjoy their lives more because they are more experienced and know what the true enjoyment is .
Youngsters call playing computer games , going to the movies and partying with friends enjoying life .
However it is too small to be an enjoyment of one 's life .
Older people enjoys their lives in a greater range .
For example , a head of a certain factory would enjoy his life by making profit , directing people and going to dinner with his family , which are far more enjoyable that playing computer games .

Secondly , Adults have a freedom to do whatever they want to enjoy .
For youngsters to enjoy their lives , there are numerous thing that are not permitted to do , such as drinking , traveling without parents .
However , there is no such barrier for adults .
For example , my uncle is now 38 years old and one day he told me that he is going on a trip worldwide for a month to get rid of stresses he got from his business .
Then he told me that he would go to these beutiful places and would come back with better future .
I , after listening to him , immediately thought of all the stress that I am getting from school and planned a travel alone .
However , I could not make the trip because of my parent 's disagreement .
From that moment I deeply realized that I can enjoy my life when I grow up .

People say that enjoyment equals happiness .
However , it is not always true .
People can get fall into a trouble if they only seek for pleasure .
This happens to young people a lot .
However , older people are able to differentiate between enjoyment and temporary pleasure because they know more and experienced more , which is why they allowed more freedom .
Therefore , older people enjoy there lives more .

644,108983.txt,P1,KOR,medium,"Some people said specialize in one specific subject is better than have knowledge or many acadamic subjects .
Both opinions are good ideas but I agree with it 's better to hav broad knowlege of many acadaic subjects because thats helpful to meet varity of people in my life and every major is relative each other .

First of all , broad knowledge is helful in society .
I 've been in New York City for 3 years now and I met a lot of different people during my New York life .
I met a lot of people from other country , I could try differents food , I saw different customs and I saw a lot of different religens .
That was the very first english class in New York I had 10 class mates in my classroom .
Everybody was from different country and they introduce each other the first day of class .
I thought I have enought knowledge about other country but some of my classmate , I hadnever heard there where their country is .
That was very big shame for me and felt sorry to them .
Our county also very small so some of our classmates did n't know where Korea is also still some peolpe ask me which part of Korea am I from .
When they asked me I got shocked because north Korean ca n't move to other country .
Korean who live in other country is all South Korean .
For me that 's very basic knowledge but other peolpe does n't know .
That time realized I should learn other culture because I was feel bad when they do n't know about my country .

Also , every major is relative each other .
My major is interior design .
Before I start to study interior design I thought I will learn only drawing and masearing .
But when I start to study I should learn mathmatic , history , and art everything .
I was wonder why should I have to take all this classes ?
But after I start study , I realized why I have to study .
I have to learn history how interior became and who start to design rooms and why .
after learn history I could understand easily and faster .
Also I took mathmatic classes that helped me to carculate all my masearment when I draw .

In conclusion , I agree with it 's better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because that 's helpful to meet people in my life and every majors relative each other .

4750,828862.txt,P6,TEL,high,"I strongly opine with the statement that it is best to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
If you visit a new place , it is always better to consult a guide since we will be ignorant about the historical information .

There are lots of benefits when you have a travel guide around .
The guides will have vast amount of information regarding the place .
For example , they could give you historical significance of the place or any other important reasons for the fame of a particular place .
It would be of no point in visiting places when you are completely unaware of its significance .

And also , the guides will have vast knowledge about the places around so that we will not miss any of them and repent later .
It is also convinient to interact with people when guides are around .
There could be huge linguistic difference and also cultural difference .
Also , there are all possibilities of getting cheated by people when you are a foreigner .
Usuaully , the guides are multilingual and hence there are no chances of getting cheated .

In India , a south asian country , there are many historical places famous for its magnificient architecture .
There are stories depicting their significane .
It would be of no point if we look at the work without any knowledge about it .
It would merely be a piece of work .
But instead if we know the story behind its significance , we will be in a position to appreciate the work .

I could give a good example to support this point .
One of my friends had been to a historical place in India .
When she returned , she told me her experiences and the work she saw .
She did not feel anything special about it .
I then , explained the significance of the place .
It was then she really appreciated it and felt that she should have known it then .
She then appreciated the culture and did further research on the topic and the culture .

Hence , i feel that it is always better to have sufficient knowledge while visiting any place .

3597,625768.txt,P2,KOR,high,"Some people may think that young people can enjoy their life more than older people while others think that older people can really enjoy their life without restraint .
I disagree to the idea that young people can enjoy their life than older people because of time constraint , insufficient money matters and a sort of the burden such as study or job .

First , young people generally do n't have enough money excluding small number of fortunate people .
Especially in the case of young students , they have to get the money from the parents or make money by working as a part-time jot .
In order to enjoy the life , it takes a lot of money .
For example , many young people would choose traveling as a way to enjoy the life .
To buy airplane ticket or driving car need fair amount of money .
Therefore , since the young people cannot afford to pay for travel cost , they cannot enjoy their life to their wish .

Second , young people are pressed to time .
In general , young people are students or worker .
It means they belong to the certain schools or workplaces .
In this sense , students are pretty much busy in keeping up with the course or school work and young workers should work on their job at their workplace .
For example , as a student , I have been always busy to do homework and I cannot imagine enjoying the life specially during the semester .
Therfore , because of the time constraint , young people have many limitations on enjoying themselves .

Third , young people have lots of burden or obligations compared to the older people , For instance , young couple who have two boys cannot relax themselves or enjoy themselves even when they have free time .
Taking care of the chilren and doing house chores can be on-going job for the young people in the stage of life .
Besides this , they have to support their children by making money .
Therefore , with the burden and obligation , young people who have family to raise cannot find time to enjoy themselves easily .

In conclusion , young people can be the generation to work rather than enjoy .
Enjoying onself needs , in general sense , money , time and freedom of any kind of obligation in life .
Considering the special nature of life style of young people , they seem to be more difficult to enjoy themselves than older people who are free of the burden for raising the children and then have enough time and money to enjoy .

3775,654424.txt,P3,KOR,medium,"When I was young , I used to go to a church and help older people who were living in my communities .
Since I was young , helping tasks were not that serious but I still remember that I had felt good and great whenever I helped them .
However , as I grew older , I had to focus on studying high school subjects such as math , history and chemistry to enter a prestigious university .
Naturally I could n't spend my `` important '' time to help my communities .
Now I regret that much and think young people should give enough time to helping their communities baecause of the following reason .

First of all , We are able to feel how happy we are right now by helping our commnunities .
There are a lot of ways of helping communities .
Among them , taking care of older people whose sons or daughters do n't live near is an important task .
They feel lonely and isolated so they need intersts of others and giving some intersts and helps to them are not that hard .
During giving them helps , we could feel how happy situations we live in now and love our own parents more than before .

In these days , young people do not give enough time to helping their communities because they have lots of thing to do .

10341,1684782.txt,P4,FRA,high,"Advertisements should present a product on an objective way but most of them make products seem much better than they really are .
By definition an advertisement should make the public buy the product and so present only his better aspect and properties .
Moreover , since they are a lot of company producing the same product they should emphasize the properties of their product .
And eventually , there are always differences between a photo or a film and the real product .

First , the purpose of an advertisement is to create a need by convincing the client that he should have this product .
Therefore the product should be perfect without any disadvantages .
But reality is different .
For example when you buy a computer , advertisement show you computers as objects everybody should have .
You could have access to internet , a lot of information , it will simplify your life .
However , they never tell you that sometimes the computer should have some problems like virus , that by using it for buying some products on internet people could see your credit card number .
All the bad aspect of the computer are forgotten .

Nowadays , in our society there are a lot of companies producing the same product .
So each company have to make the difference with the others by emphasizing the properties of their product .
they should show that their products is better than those of the others .
For example , cleaning product for cloths all clean the clothes .
but one company will show you that our product is better than the other one for several reasons such as using less product .

Eventually , there are always differences between photo or film they made that are taken in the perfect condition to make the product seems perfect and the product that you received .
For examples the color of clothes are sometimes different due to light .
So you could see on the television a perfect black skirt and eventually have a grey skirt .

As a conclusion , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are by emphasizing their properties , not talking aboute the inconvenients and showing the product in the perfect conditions that you couldn'y have .
However in the way we always want perfect products are n't we a bit reponsible of this phenomenom ?

3621,629293.txt,P6,SPA,medium,"the best way to travel is in a grup led by a tour guide

I agree because if you have a person that know about the place that you are going to or you are visiting , he can give you an explain about the history , about the lifestile , the culture , the food , etc. in the other way if you go somewhere and you do not know nothing about it , for example where is a museum , a typical place , a chuch , etc. then you have to search for yourself all the places that you should visit and it problably will take you some time , that you can spend in other places .

For example if you go alone to the Mexico city i am sure that you will lost on the center town , although Mexico is a very small city .

in addition if you have a tour guide , you can ask himfor everything that you want. a tour guide is a person that knows the meaning of the places .
is was for they are working and they enjoy explay people about the places they have known and learning .

if you are thinking on do a travel without a tour guide you have to study perfectly the place where you want to go just for you can find all the thins that are representatives in that conutry .

other reason is bacause all the people do not act in the same way .
i mean taht if you nedd some help or ask about a street maybe you do not have someone to ask and ypo will be alone .
if you have a tour guide he takes you everywhere you want .

the condition of have a tour guide is only tha t you have to pay for their service , but i think that is more important have a nice vacation without troubles or accidents than have a vacation where you were all the time stressed .

5325,928007.txt,P7,JPN,high,"Although understanding the concept and organize the process of the study is always necessary for the student , still the learning of the actual facts and examples is even more valuable .
The reason can be divided in two main points ; studying has to be more practical and useful for the student , and they have to get the ability to develop the idea for the real study .

Understanding only the concept is not practical .
Student have to be able to reflect that concept in the actual example .
When we study the Sonata-form in the music theory class , the first idea we get is the form of exposition , development , and recaputuation sections .
Then we get more detail , which is the key-relationship and even more structual matters such as introduction and coda .
However , to really understand this formal structure , we have to look at the actual Sonata-form music .
Where the exposition starts and ends , how the development is ...
etc .
Music is maybe longer than you think , or more complicated than you think .
To deal with that , not only just memorizing the form , but also we have to handle how to discover them in the actual music and how you would musically response when you actually play that music .
Then , we can be confident to say `` I know what the sonata-form is . ''

Consequencely , the actual studying always require how to develop the idea by our own way .
We cannot do it without the acknowledge of actual facts .
Studying the concept of Schubert 's songs in the music history class is quite interesting but they are usually introduced really brief - students do not even know the German language , which the texts are usually in .
It is good to get the idea how Schubert linked the text and music , but to play it , we have to develop the idea even more .
Finding where the text and music matches , and then , you need to think `` Why Schubert did this ?
To get the answer , maybe we can look at another example or other music too .
What did he tried to imply here ? ''
When you get the answer for that , you can really say that we could develop the idea with the facts .

Neverthless the understanding of concept and idea is very necessary to organize the studying process , still the details - facts and examples - has much more important role in order to get the real knowledge .

8251,1284227.txt,P8,ARA,high,"People 's personalities differ between each other , and so do their sklls and habits .
What one person maybe bad at could be another 's field of experties .
The human nature drives to explore what is un explored , to experience what is unexperienced .
We try new things and take risks every day at home , at work , and among our friends , to find ourselves and to improve our charectors , and that is what create successful people .

Trying different things improves our charector .
You may try different recipes for dinner , recipes you had never tried before , making mixs your self .
That , for example , improves your taste and creativity .
It makes you experince things you thought never existed .
When you choose to start your own business but fear the loss , going on with your plans builds up confidence in you .
When you travel by an airplance , eventhough you fear it , that gives you courge .

We are good at what we already know , but are we at what we never tried ?
That is the thin line that differs seccessful people from those who are not .

6853,1100270.txt,P3,ZHO,high,"As a young person myself , I often feel guilty for spending so little time with the community .
I had often noticed that the social bonds between neighbors have diminished in recent years , and people are becoming less caring than before .
That 's why I think we should definitely spend more time helping our communities .

But how ?
The main reason nowadays that young people does n't spend much time with their communities is that they are crammed with homework , extracurricular activities , entertainment , ...
etc .
They are simply not spending a lot of time strolling about the neighborhood .
Without any interactions with their neighbors , young people will easily neglect their role as a member of their community .
Although they read about community service in their textbooks , few actually participate in it .
And when you ask them why , they simply reply : ` I do n't have time . '

So if we wish to solve this problem , the first thing to do is to decrease the amount of burden on young people .
Schools should end earlier so that young people can spend more time inside the community .
Teachers should give their students less work on weekends so they could have adequate time to conduct effective community service .
Parents should relieve their child of to much activity and they should not force them to go to cramschools .
Without these corrections to our education system , schools would end up to actually teach young people not to spend time with the community .

Of course , one might contend that young people will end up spending the extra time playing computers and not doing community service at all .
That might be the case for some kids , but in my opinion , if people felt they are involved in their community , they would try their best to make it better .
This sentiment can be further enhanced by government propaganda and social education .

It is everyone 's responsibillity to bring young people back to community service .
They should not simply put their blame on laziness manifested by the younger generation .
I pray for a day when the old bonds between neighbors can be re-established .

1974,340486.txt,P2,FRA,low,"In my point of view , old peolpe are more happy of there life than young people .
There are three reasons to this opinion .
First , young people have a lot of problems .
Then you study you have all the stress of the examination .
Furthermore , it 's in this perdiod of life that you have to decidate of your future and you know it .
You are conscient that all your decision will have a very big effect on your avenir .

Second , older persons are more able to appreciate than the young generation .
The oldest genaration have experience so they are more able to take in account what happen .
They already achive something in there life so this people are more confidente .
For exemple , when a 18 years old man felt in love we certanly not realise the chance that he have .
On the over hand a 45 years old man realise exactly the chance that he have when he is in love .

Finaly , although some people think that because students make more party they enjoy more there time .
It 's well know that alcool , who is to much drunk at this party , covert only the problems of this persons .

In conclusion , I will said that because of the too stressful situation that is accepted with alcool and the security and experience of old generation ; young people do n't enjoy life more than the older people do .

261,45347.txt,P8,TEL,medium,"I agree with the statement mentioned .
Beyond every success there is a risk associated with it .
If we consider our renowed scientists and researchers , behind their every success there is a risk .
They keep on doing risks in finding out new inventions and new discoveries .

Successful people probably will not wish to do the things which are well known to them because they think in a different way , aiming high to achieve something which is new .
In these aspects they do greater risks to find out new things .
They are very much dare enough to do any sort of risk in achieving a positive result .

For example i consider Madam Curie to be the most risk taking and a most successful scientist .
As she laid path in the discovery of `` radium '' , a radio active material she took a greater risk in the discovery of radium .
She had done a lot of experiments in finding the radio active material .
Her experiments involved many risk taking factors in which they are very dangerous .
At last she found out the radium after a series of experiments and reasearch .
The discovery of radium thus involved many risk factors and atlast she has tasted the success .
If she would not had taken the risk means the radium would not have been found till now .

In the same way as mentioned above , successful people always try for new things rather than doing the things which are already very well known to them .
Successful people always try new things and new tasks .
Its incorporated in them to try for a new one .
In this process many scientists have laid path to many inventions such as Marconie invented a radio , Grahambell invented a telephone and so on .

So i conclude the essay by stating that risk must be taken by every individual in achieving success and try out for a new thing rather than doing the thing which is known to us .

Will cars be such important than today or will they lose their significance and replaced by other kinds of movements ?
Will it be possible to use a car in twenty years , at all ?

When you take a closer look to that question , you will realize that the human population on earth is growing rapidly and thus the demand for cars will increase , too .
Furthermorem , production costs on cars will decrease because of the growing globalization , so prices for cars decrease and more and more people can afford them .

Moreover , another important fact is that our knowlwdge on new technologies is growing very rapidly , as well .
Maybe a totally new kind of a car will be invented and everyone wants to buy one .
When I take a look on the streets of my hometown I do not see any cars older than a few years .
Thus , the quantity of cars will not decrease .

But there are also arguments which supports the statement above .
Oil is more and more getting shorter .
In a few years there will be much shortage on oil so gas will get more and more expensive .
The poor people on earth will not be able to spend their whole money on gas so the quantity of cars in use on earth could decrease .

Furthermore if there are no inventions which makes it possible to reduce air pollution caused by cars there will be probably some restrictions relating to car production to slow down changes in our climate .

All in all , my opinion is that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use because oil will definitly get short .
There are no signs that the car building industry will make such a new invention which changes our lives - related to cars - significently .

7176,1131180.txt,P7,ITA,high,"I think that both understanding ideas and learning facts are equally important for a students , but if I were forced to choose between the options I would say that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning a list of facts .

The comprehension of the idea that gives the meaning to a fact will enable the student to understand all the facts that are based on that same idea .
For example : teachers teach the children how to add numbers by explaining them how addition works , not by telling them that 2 + 2 = 4 , that 2 + 3 = 5 and so on .
When a child has understood the idea and the concept of addition he 'll be able to make all sorts of addition .

What i really mean to say is that the understanding of a concept will lead you to the full comprehension of several facts of the same kind .

On the other hand i can not avoid to notice that we face a big risk in focusing too much on ideas and concepts : the risk of leaving out the reality .
Reality is very important because it 's the point we tend to : all ideas and concepts are studied to give reasons on things we 've seen in our experience , if we do not refer to reality we would be just speaking about nothing , our talking would be only speculation which is not usefull to us .

I would say that we need a balance between the two things , because they are both important to the students : i think that a good method of making them understand a theory or a concept would be giving them examples , because talking about experience is effecive in making them realize what concept we are dealing with .

On the other hand I think that when a teacher talks about a specific fact he should always say what is the idea that stays behind that fact so that he woul obtain two important results : fistly the student would fully understand the fact in its implications , causes , consequences ( for example why a war was declared , what consequences it had . . )
and secondly the students would be able to understand many facts of the same kind because they may recognize the same ideas behind other facts .

The fist tought I stand on this oppiean is they are not afraid of challenge , because of that , they will want to try anything new , ti find out which thing is better , they are not afraid to fell down , because they will stand up again .

The seacond reason is the desire of success .
If you want to be succesed , you must take risk in lots of new things , to find out which one is good which one is bad , find the good one to stand your work your bussiness , after that you will learn a lot from that experence , be stranger to face more things , that really makes you to be successful .

3023,525210.txt,P7,JPN,medium,"I disagree with the statement showing `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' .
For example , why do all of us deeply study about history ?
This is because the knowledge of facts which happened in the past may lead us to think of how to think or how to act , now , and in the future .
There is a famous Japanese sentence shown as `` Open your future by learning from the past '' .
This exactly explains why it is important to learn facts .

Furthermore , I think that any kind of idea or concept is created by an event or fact which happened in the past .
For instance , the idea to launch the United Union , involving all nations in an organization to build an organization for them to solve national conflicts by preventing war , was created after the big event , the 2nd World War .
After learning that this kind of war means nothing to whole of the world and all of the population , the genius leaders had reached to this idea .

Therefore , I think that it is also very important for students to learn facts as much as understanding ideas and concepts .

However , the best way to travel is to go on a trip with a group led by a tour guide .
There are three reasons for that .

First , if a person is traveling in unknown area by the traveler himself or herself , then it is more safe to go on with a group with a tour guide who know the area that the person is traveling .

Second , if the person is going alone , it is better to go on a trip with groups of people .
That way , the person can have the opportunity to meet new people as well as see new places .
Also the traveling with a group can more safe , because in case a person is lost during the trip , then he/she can get help from other people that the person is traveling with .

Third , going on a trip with a group of people will be more fun .
If there is more people , then more things you can do with lot of places .
For example , if a person is going to Las Vagas , then it would be whole lot for fun to go with lot of people to play poker together .

In some cases it would be the very nice if a person could have some own personal time for himself or herself during the travel with the group led by the tour guide .
These days , lots of tour guide provide free time during the traval for the travelers who would like to have some own personal time by themselves .

In conclustion , the most ideal way to travel is to go on a trip with a group led by a tour guide for safty and to enjoy , and if a person would like , then he/she could take some free time from the group and the tour guide .
"
9180,1464190.txt,P6,ARA,low,"i agree with that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide for several reasons such as , to discover new places , to feel safe and get good prices .

first , in any where or place need to be with someone who knows the place where you want to go because he can take you to places as you wish .
for exaple , last summer i went to japan by myself .
so , at that ti me there was a friend who knows me .
after ward , he took me to many beautiful places in Tokyo .
so if i was alone i would n't feel enjoy .
that person was really a good tour guide .

second , in any country even in USA which is one of the safest countries around the world , you will feel unsafe if there is no person can tell me which places should i go or not , which time should you go outside or not to go .
meanwhile when you have a tour guide , that means you are safer especially if he from the area which you will go that will be better .
as a result , he is going to be your securty because the people will know that you have a citizen who works as a guide .

last point , is getting good prices and that is true .
for instance , in Africa specifically in Egypt , if you have a taxi 's friend , that means you are strong person .
morever , nobody will sell you by high prices or take much money from you without doudt .
other ways if you are alone there almost all the theifs and sellers will take money from you without anyright .

in conclusion , if you do n't want to think a lot and you want have fun , to feel safety and to be smart by the dealing with the people , just travel with a tour guide .

7655,1173480.txt,P7,ITA,medium,"In student 's life learning is very important ; the tipical day of a student consists mainly of learning .
Although almost all students learn a lot and consider learning an essential factor , it is important to analyze how they learn .
That is , one should consider the objectives and the focus of a student who is learning .

Quite often students learn new topics but forget them after a while .
The reason for this might be the way how they were learning .
In my opinion , it is much more important for students to understand ideas and concepts that is it for them to learn facts .
In the following I will give reveral reasons to support my statement .

Firstly , learning does not mean learning by hard , that is `` memorizing facts '' , but understanding of ideas .
If a person learns by hard , he will tend to forget the notions learned as soon as he does not need or treat them anymore .

Secondly , learning should not just be finalized to get high scores in a short time , but should enable students to apply the concepts they have learned and extend them also to other situations .

Tirdly , learning constitute the basis of research .
In order to be able to make research in a given area , it is essential to understand all what is connected to it .

If I consider my experience , I think that understanding ideas is really essential for your profession later on and I would suggest to support students .
For instance , common discussions help students to verify if they understood a concept correctly or not .
In some other cases , it could be helpful to apply a concept in a study , in a use case or in the laboratory .

In summary , I am convinced that learning facts is not sufficient for students .
It will not enable them to proceed on their own in an area .
On the contrary , I consider understanding of ideas and of concepts as beeing essential in the learning process .

Cars have an important place in our life .
I 'm almost sure we ca n't think of leaving our cars at home and go to work by bus or simply walking , if we know that we have the possibility to do it by driving our car .

We trust cars , the majority of us believe that cars have been the best invention of ever and that anything will ever substitute them .
If nowadays cars are so important , thinking of the next twenty years I 'm sure that they will gain importance instead of losing it .
If a family is composed of four people , we will have as many cars as the number of people having a driving license .
This means that if each of them can drive , we will have four cars .

A possible explanation is related to our need to have our own car .
Cars help us to feel indipendent .
We can leave and we can come back whenever we want and the only thing we need to do is to drive .

However , car means pollution .
There have been a lot of promotions thaht have tried to prevent us from using our cars but they have failed .
Everyone of us know cars damage the environement because of the toxic gas they produce .
Sometimes , when something reminds us of it , we even think about catching a bus or going for a walk but we never do it .
Car is comfortable , it can take us everywhere and we ca n't stop from using it .
The only possibility we have to leave our cars at home is to find a faster , cheaper and more comfortable way to travel .
If we find a valid substitute for the car , perhaps in the next twenty yars there will be less cars than today .

However , I ' sure that nothing will ever been as perfect as the car .

1131,186616.txt,P5,TUR,high,"Since the ancient times , man has investigated ways to improve the ways to explore the world and cover great distances with minimum effort .
From the invention of the wheel , to the establishment of the trade routes via ships , transportation has come a long way and gained even more importance .
In todays world , being able to travel freely is no longer a privilage , but a basic right for all human beings .
And , we simply would not be able to fully appreciate this right , if we did not have cars .

Cars give us the ability to travel individually and freely , assuming that we can afford to buy one and operate it .
They are essential for people who work , have families and have busy schedules .
One must also remember that for some people , their cars are essential in their struggle to make a living .
For instance people like taxi drivers and transporters rely on their cars .
As a result I believe that no matter how well the public transportation gets , in the next twenty years or so , there will still be a demand for individually owned and operated cars .
I belive that the need for cars will even be more significant with the expected increase in human population expected within the next two decades .

In todays modern world , twenty years is a long enough time for significant technological achievements to take place .
As a result , I also believe that these achievements will have a remarkable impact for cars as well .
I think cars will be a lot more different from what we have today .
They are going to be more efficient , more cost effective , less polluting and safer to operate .
Thus , more and more people would buy cars , or whatever replaces them , and as a result we will have more cars in the future .

People like cars for the things they offer us .
Things like freedom , independence and ability to make a living It is very important for all of us to have these things in our lives and cars can make this a reality .
By improving the means we produce cars in the next twenty years , it is possible satisfy the ever growing human population with the finish form of cars technology has to offer .
As a result I belive that the need for cars will be increasing in the decades to follow as well as their numbers in our lives .

1929,332739.txt,P5,ZHO,medium,"Cars which are the most typical transportations are widely used by the people all over the world .
But lately people found that cars also should responsible for the serious air pollutions .
So , according to this reason , many people requires the government to restrict the number of the cars and they believe that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years .
I do n't quite agree with this statement for following reasons .

Though too many cars will pollute the air , it is a convenient way to travel by car .
And this thought will not change for only a couple of scores .
There may be many kind of transportations , such as bus , subways , planes , ships and so on , but not can be compared as cars .
Take me for an example , if I want to go to a supermarket which is 4 miles away from my home , what transport would I first consister ?
Of cause the car !
I do n't want to waste my time to wait for a bus , it is unable to take plane or ship and the subway station is far away from my house .
In conclution , unless we invent another kind of transportation , cars wil still become the best transportaion in decades

The biggest problem of the car , everyone can tell , is the waste air and smoke .
Cars use gasline as their power and release harmful gases which pollute the air .
Gasline may be run out and air should never be polluted .
However , this problem can be solved .
Recently , many car builders have invent new cars that use solar power rather than gasline .
This is sure to help protect our natural resources and our environment .

The overcrowed roads may be the second biggest problem .
Many of people think that we must solve it , otherwise we will hard to move efficiently .
But this problem is due to the over-growing population , it 's not the cars ' fault .
If the population decreases , this problem will not exsit .
So this is not the excuse not using the car .

All in all , we must find a positive way to solve the problem .
Using the solar power and solve the road problem , the car will still be useful and helpful .
As a result , the car will not decrease in twenty years .

549,99231.txt,P2,ITA,high,"A lot of Greek lyrical poets wrote odes to the beauty of youth , and elogiated it as the highest , most rewarding stage in life .
When the time came for them to deal with the old age , all their words assumed negative and dark implications , their rhythm slowed down , their optimism faded away , as if the wonderful joys that they had collected during their youth had completely disappeared , leaving no good memories , no sign at all .

In my opinion , this is the best feature of the years that I am living : the great sense of expectation that I feel every day .
When you are young , everything seems easy to reach , possible .
It is as if you are given all the opportunities you want , and you can even dare to refuse some of them , to pick the ones you prefer .
And then , you are still at school .

Studying definitely brings along a big amount of new , different and stimulating experiences that hit , strike and confuse the students with fantastic , oniric ideas of what the world could be .
This is the period in which they - we - inhalate the greatest part of images , sounds , colors and words , our own heritage for the rest of our life .
This is the time when our minds are completely open .

On a more pragmatical side , youngsters ' physical constitution allows them to do more activities than the elders can do .
Young people can run , dance , play every sport they want without having to worry for their backache or their ostheoporosis .
What is more , they can travel , see the world and all the beauty in it .
In his novel `` On The Road , '' Joseph Conrad writes that everyone who has the courage to wake up one day and leave to no definite destination is `` crazy , crazy of life . ''
I do not think that there is a better way to say why youth is such an amazing , satisfacting and breath-taking period .
Maybe , as I said , the most important reason lies in the fact that young people can still dream .
And it is when you stop dreaming that your old age begins .

5921,1018784.txt,P2,FRA,high,"I do not think young people enjoy their life more then older people .
I think they enjoy it in a more physical way maybe then older people .
But I think older people enjoy life in a more contemplaining way .
Indeed when you are young you can do sports .
I love horse-riding .
In order to be able to ride a horse you need strong muscles .
Strenght in this specific case is associated with youth .
Indeed when you are 80 years old , chances are you will not have the strength anymore to hold yourself up on a horse .
I believe that the shier capacity of doing something can make one happy , just as the incapacity of doing something can make one unhappy .
As a consequence when I will be 80 years old and I will not be able to ride horse anymore , that might make me unhappy .
Or , I will recall the times when I sat on a horse and will tell my grand children about how wonderful I looked when I sat on a horse .
Which leads me to my next point .

I am not capable of saying today that I look wonderful on a horse .
I think about improovement , when I think of horse riding .
On the other hand , when I will be older I will be able to contemplate all the things , I will have done physically and experienced over my life time .
In my opinion that is something just older people can do .
Which in my opinion is a good thing , because it shows that nature is well made .
Younger people have different ways to enjoy life , in what they are able to do for example .
And then their other ways they are not able to enjoy their life , because they are young .
The same goes for older people .
They have their way of enjoying life , like for instance contemplating their experiences over a life time .
Why because they are older and they have lived for a long time and they also have the time to think about it .
Just like I do not have the time to think about how I look when I ride a horse , because I am young and therefore I am thinking about improvment .

So really there is a time for everything in life .
There is a time to enjoy life , as a young person and as an old person and that makes life probably fair .

1508,251380.txt,P2,TEL,medium,"`` Old is gold '' goes a famous quote .
I disagree with the statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
Young people are always busy with something or the other , like completing assignments , heading for meetings etc etc .
Where as the older people , they completed every thing and now relaxed .
For them there are no assignments to be finished or meetings to be attended .

For example lets consider a young man and an old man .
We will consider some of their daily routine .
Young man needs to wake up early like 5.00am in the morning go for a gym or jog to maintain his body .
He should again rush to his home as he must get ready to attend his office or university .
Its a tight schedule .
Where as an old man , he can wake up whenever he wants , can go for a walk whenever he wants and can return leisurely .
So who is enjoying life ?
old man .

Now we will consider and old woman and a young woman .
Young woman. , she must also wake up early to go for a jog or a walk to remain fit and return to home quickly as she must go for an university or office , ofcourse there is an exception for housewives but if the housewives have children then again she is responsible for the child 's upbringing .
On the other hand the older woman can wake up whenever she wants and do whatever she wants as she has lot of time with her .
Some woman enjoy cooking so the old woman can try new dishes or she can write peoms do whatever she wants .
So i strongly feel that older people enjoy life more than younger people .
Younger people are always associated with more responsibilities than older people , building up their career etc etc .

5237,910544.txt,P1,JPN,medium,"I support this opinion that to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to specialize in one specific subject .
To learn one special subject sometime might lead to bright future , for example in terms of invention in science .
If someone who do n't devote oneself into one special subject , most of amazing invention was not created .
But in general we need to have broad knowledge .

One reason is focuing on one particular subject makes predjudes , and such kind of person cannot make flat decision in proper manner .
I 've learn a lot of things thoroughout learning for example Moral study , World history , Asian history , Japanese history , Math , Chemistry , Physics , Art , Art history , Japanese civil Low , Internatioal Low or what ever .

To learn broadly is important to realize `` truth '' between broad range of knoledge .
This is just a very simple example , but we can learn tons of things from the World history , for example , but if we do n't have any hi-leveled background in literature , we can not understand the way of thinking that we see on the text book of History .

Also , from leaning Moral study and Biology , somebody can find out heart of affection .

To learn many things would be very good opportunity to find our own tarent out .
Needless to say , if everybody can find out their own talent without seeng many things , but it is not realistic .
Some scientists found out their talent or their way to live in the future , but it is too rare case .

In general we human being should know a lot of things to reach their own principal .
This is not only for personal issue , but also for all people in the world .

So I agree this opinion .

I completely agree with the statement above .
Albert Einstein quotes , `` Try to be a man of value and not a man of success . ''
Success follows people who are innovative in their ideas and are expressive to present them freely .
Albert Einstein never set out to come up with the `` Theory of relativity '' .
It was his desire to explore and question every aspect of everyday life which brought him the fame to be the inventor of `` Theory of relativity '' .

Constant change is the human nature .
And the people who bring about this change in an evident manner are the ones who are ready to think out-of-the-box .
Centuries ago , everything was done on paper , stories to accounts , medicine to religion etc .
Today , everything is written on tape drives and stored electronically .
Thanks to mankind , who was constantly looking for options to change .
We went from pen to typewriter and then to computer and to super computers today .
The numerous inventions made in every field of life are all because some one somewhere was thinking beyond the ways which they know how to do well .
It was the quest to do things better and add value to what is being done today , which led to new discoveries .

Take an example of Bill Gates , he is successful today because he started Microsoft , a Windows operating System which sits in almost every household today .
His desire to do something new brought him this fame .
And his quest to constantly bring about the change to the world is keeping his success intact .

In summary , it is seen all around , people who have taken the risk to do something new are the ones who got success and fame .

11905,1960235.txt,P4,SPA,medium,"It is known that several products do n't fulfil all the requirements , which have been presented by saling of these products .
Therefore , I agree with the idea that the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
However , I can understand the reasons because these products have been produced and saled on that way .

The economical system of the most countries in the world is the capitalism .
In this system people have to earn their own money by buying products or by doing an activity or work .
That means there must be some people to sale products and other ones to buy them .
If nobody buys a particullary thing , the market will stop producing that object .
The production of that thing would be wasting money .
Indeed , the best way to make money must be found .

Because of this , the trade of products became important and the market could be invented .
Its development helps the politico-economical situation of each country .

On the one hand , there must be the posibility to buy necesary products like food and clothes .
Offering the necesary products with acceptable prices , the market gives facilities to get these products in accesible places ( e.g. food stores ) .

On the other hand , it is not possible that every store sales similar products .
Therefore , the market tries to discover new products which have to get necesary in the new society .
This opens the posibility to create new articles and activities .

Altrough the human society is changing and new products are being invented , people do n't buy all the products , because they are n't convinced of the quality .
Perhaps they do n't realize the advantages of having that new product .
Therefore , advertisements have to present the products on way that convice the persons to buy them .

I can understand this situation in the market and I think that this way is sometimes necesary to keep the economical situation of a country stable .

We can make jenous from learn one specific subjects , but any one can not be like that .

Also we have many things to learn to live in human such as , we have to learn about social , P.E , music , hiatory , and we have to learn from each other .
That is why we have learn knowledge of many academic subjects .
It effects to people what is bad things and what is good things .
If people learn only one specific subject , the people can make problem because they do not know how to do the otherthing , maybe they are good at what they have had learn , but it is not enough to live with people .

The people can not live alone in socity people have to help each other and people have to know how to help the other people , also how to survive from social and they lean those things from different academic subjects .
They can not get those many ideas from learn only one specialize in one specific subject .

In my oppinion people better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
People learn many academic subjects , and people can usewhat they have learn in many ways .
Also we have to share the ideas from what they have learn and we can talk about that and make that ideas better .

In my opinion , travel with a tour guide is one of the good way to tavel .
But it is very hard to say that travel with a guide is the `` best '' way to travel .

Depending people , there are so many kinds of trips .
Someone wants to go somewhere as a stranger after he broke up with his girlfriend or someone wants to go to historical places to find the answer of research and get some information .

To the first type of people , it is not good to take a trip with guide .

It is so vast that there is no end to it .
Even if you feel you have expertised in the subject there will always be something related to that subject which you are not aware of because in every subject there is always some advancement being brought .
In my opinion it is always good to have knowledge about different subjects rather than a specific subject .
These are the following reasons for which I support this opinion .

Firstly , knowledge of different academic subjects will always give a person better job opportunity when he steps out into the competent world .
He will have different choices available with him from which he can choose the better one for him .
However if he is equipped with just a single subject he has no choice but to go for jobs available in that field which might not be as appealing as he thought it would be .
I had one of my friend who studied geography but then later she ended up realising that she was not in the right place and she wolud rather enjoy better if she was in the field of computers .

Secondly , it avoids boredom .
We become lethargic studying something for a long time .
If we are studying more than one subject we can switch over to the next and get a change .
For instance , if we are studying history for five hours and we have music as our alternative subject switching over to it will always be refreshing .

Thirdly , we obtain an understanding in different areas of study .
By specializing in a single subject we will have knowledge about only that particular field .
However , world is filled with variety of things and if we are to encounter anything else other than our subject we might feel as if lost in a forest .
This is not good because it can keep us away from mingling with others and this can also lead to frustrations in life .

Hence , I feel it is better to obtain bit of knowledge in various subjects because this will help us widen our horizon .
It will help us to find a place in society and also help remain happy .

In my opinion , most advertisements make products seem much better as that is what they are meant to do .
Advertisements make the products look much more attaractive and much more useful than they really are .
A lot of companies spend a lot of money only on this area .
This is due to the fact that they have realised that most of the consumers believe the advertisements and will be under the infulence of them .

However , a lot of the times it is very unfair to the customers as well .
These advertisements can be very misleading sometimes and customers end up buying what they dont really want .
I have seen it and experinenecd it myself .
Television advertisements have mislead me in buying many products that i did not want .
Another technique that many business firms use is that of using celebrities to persuade people for buying their goods .
Celebrities with very high social status 's can be very persuasive at times and this is another case of misleading the consumer .

There is not much anybody can do about this either .
People need to understand that firms would try their level best to make people buy what they do not what .
It is us who are at fault as well .
Beleiving these advertisements blindly would be stupidity on our part .
We are the ones who are spending money and we need to make sure that we do not wate what we have .

The car is actually a symbol of the contemporary society as much as computers or mobile phones .
We all know how usefull and comfortable it is to go by car , and how faster we can get to very far distances , but we usually forget how devastating it is fot the earth .

In my opinion sooner or later there will be fewer cars : first of all , the price of petrol will rise so much that it will be impossible for a normal family to afford a car trip .
In facts , on one hand it will be soon very difficult to find new petrol sources because they are disappearing and they are able to regenerate themself olny in thousands of years .
On the other hand , those big companies that held the petrol distribution have no interest in developing new energy sources that could be cheaper for the costumers .

Secondly , I hope that soon there will be more laws against pollution : indeed , the governments of all the world have to admit the fact that if the planet is too polluted there is no possibility of life for the human race .
This strategy should start as soon as possible , giving money for the reserch of natural energy and giving more opportunity to the people to consume less energy and to pollute less .
There are many ways to do this : indeed , cities should have efficent public transport , or maybe the people that use solar pannels or other natural energy devices in their houses should be helped by the government .

In conclusion , there is the possibility that the people will start to leave their cars at home and go by foot : I am quite sceptical about it , but I really hope that the people will understand how important the enviroment is for our lives .

However , I do n't think it 's true .
The purpose of attending schools is basically for becoming a professional in one field .
Broad knowledge about other fields is not necessary to become an expert .

Normally , we learn subjects of various kinds in elementary schools , junior high schools , and high school .
However , most of subjects which we learned there are not practical knowledge to live .
For example , I studied Biology and Geology for more than 4 years in my junior high school and high school but I have never used this kind of knowledge to solve problems I encounterd .
I am sure that it was waste of time because they are useless .

I majored in music composition in my college for 6 years .
I received BA and MA from the college .
However , I am still studying music composition in an another institution because I thought what I studied in my college was only a small part of entire subject .
I am sure that It takes a lot of time to become a real professional in one field so I think all student must concentrate on just one field to become a real expert since we do not have so much time .

If you learn several subject , especially in college or university , it normally costs more .
If you major in two subjects , for example , Fine art and Mathematic , you have to pay normally more tuition than students who major only one subject .
In addition , you have to buy more books and materials for several subjects .
However , you have less chance to become a real professional on both field because you spent less time compared to students who major in only one subject .
It does not make any sence .
It 's just waste of money .

11632,1914756.txt,P1,HIN,medium,"The issue at hand is whether to have a baisc knowledge of many acedemic subjects or to speciialize in one subjects .
In my opinion it is better to specialize in one subject rather than to have basic knowledge of many subjects .
This is because alot of time and energy will be spent on studying many subjects .
On the other hand by specializing in one subject a person can have full knowledge of that subject and advance in that field .

First reason of my belief to specialize in one subject is that the bounderies of knowlegde is too large for one individual to cover .
Knowledge is an infinite ocean and is very difficult for an individual to acquire it even the basic of it .
While studying one subject will be much easier and useful since then a person can apply his or her knowledge .

Secondly i think one should specialize in a subject because by studying too many subjects the individual might get confused .
The individual in the process of learning many subjects might not be able to learn even one subject properly which wiil render all his studying useless since his brain will be distracted by too much information .
Studying one subject will not distract the individual since he will have only one subject to concentrate on .

Lastly it is better specialize in one spefic subject because studying one subject will make an individual better and better each day in that subject .
The person will command an expertize on the subject , which ensures his progress and development .

Thus for a person to advance and progress in life he or she should specialize in one subject rather than acquiring the knowledge of many subjects and end up in learning nothing .

9437,1516002.txt,P6,FRA,medium,"Nowadays , it is more common to travel in a group led by a tour guide , but it does n't mean that it is the best way to travel and discover a country .
The fact that you are dependent of a group and that you have not the possibility to meet native people are reasons which explain why I do n't think that travelling in a group is good .

Firstly , when you travel in a group , you are not independent .
You cannot visit monuments and places that you want .
You have to follow the group and the schedules which are provided by the tour guide .
For exemple , if you want to eat in a specific restaurant , you have to ask the permission to the guide and come back in a specific time .
Another thing is that if you are exhausted and you need to have some rest , you cannot not do it because of your appartenance to the group .

Secondly , travelling in a group led by a tour guide does n't permit to discover the culture of a country and to meet native people .
In general , when you stay in group , you have to go in a specific hotel .
You have not the opportunity to sleep in an bed and breakfast .
Tour guide will show you the most common or famous place , but not the secret and amazing places of a contry .
In touristic trips , you cannot be immerged in the culture or be in relation with the abits of the natives .
Even if yo are in a different country , you stay with people who are the same heritage .

To conclude , I think that the best way to travel is to organize a trip by yourself .
Even if it requieres more efforts , I am sure that you will apreciate your trip much better than if you travel in a group led by a tour guide .

4677,815021.txt,P8,TUR,medium,"I can see both advantages and disadvantages to try new things and take risk for being successful .
You can whether choose stability and use traditional ways and avoid risk or try new ways and take risk for being successful .
I definetely believe that people should try new things and take risk for being succesful .

If you do everything with a routine that means you know the results .
For example if a farmer use traditional ways for agriculture , he can guess how much crops he will get .
He can avoid risks by doing that .
But it is not a creative way and it is obvious that he wo n't be successful .
He will get as same amount crop as next year .
The point I am trying to make is , that is not a vakid way for being a suscussful person .
On the other hand he could try different ways in order to get much crop which means taking risk for success .

In my opinion , successful people try new things and take risks .
For instance , if the farmer try a new agriculturel way which is not experienced before he can get a different amount of crops .
he could get whether '' less or much '' but the point is he can be successful by taking that risk .
I already know that lots of successful people in business area tried new things and figure out new ways .
That is the main reason of their success .
For instance a very well known newspaper owner was just a writer in a newspaper .
He decided take risk , he resinsged and established a local newspaper and then he made it success .
And we all know that newspaper owner today .

To sum up , I always experienced that successful people take risks .
They try new ways instead of only doing what they already know .
They take risk for being successful .

7755,1190208.txt,P3,TUR,medium,"I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I believe that the reason behind this statement are the parents .
The child will grow up depending on how the parents raise them .
It is the parents responsibility to give their children the knowledge of the community they live in and what they have to do in order to fit in their community .

I strongly believe that the young people nowadays are very spoilt .
They are not taught the value of money .
Families give them enormous amounts of money and the freedom to spent it as they want .
As every young person they think that everything in life is money .
Because of this , young people have no morals left .
They grow up learning how to spend money .
Parents do not give as much time as before to their children .

Even the celebration of the holidays are not the same anymore .
Young ones care about their morals much less than the older generation .
For example , I live in Istanbul , and according to our religious holidays the whole family , from youngest to the oldest , comes together .
If not the young ones go to visit their elders .
But , nowadays unfortunately this is not happening .
Younger generations do not care about these things .
They prefer being with their friends .
Life to them is about drinking , driving the most expensive car , going out with the pretiest girl or wearing only brand names .

As a conclusion , I blame the parents for this situation .
Every parent is responsible for their own child and it is up to the parents how they brought up their child in to this community .
Young people either will be welcomed by their community or be rejected .

9204,1468386.txt,P3,ARA,medium,"In fact , there are great changes of our life nowadays , and the style of life is very fast than before .
Most of the young people are busy about their future in this type of life and have not enough time to help their communities because they care about themselves only and sometimes because of the lack of their schedulest of young people are struggling to reach to high positions in their career and to increase their salaries .
Concerning their dreams to reach to high position in the job , the person exerts his best effort by any ways to achieve his goal to be for example , the manager of the company , so he seeks for himself not for his community .
Second thing , young peoples are caring about is to gain money as much as they can to be a rich man in ashort time , that can be through more than one job to save more money or by travelling abroad to gain more money , so the main aim of the young people is themselves only high position and much money , and their communities are not in their minds .

In addition to the previous reason , the young people have not enough time to serve their communities is the inability of the young people to arrange their times through a schedule or by following the concept of priority .
Regarding the schedule , If the person put aschedule everyday about the duties , he will do , I think he can find enough time to help his community through helping the poor people , give some training lessons to children .
Second thing , which is very important to the young people is to put in their minds the priority to give some time for his community by many ways to hel the community to solve its problems .
The young peoples , besides their dreams , they should give sometime to their community .

In summary , the young peoples have not enough time to help their communities due to their interesting only about their dreams to high rank and more money , and otherthing , they have not the ability to arrange the time and their societies ias away from their minds .

9106,1449754.txt,P8,HIN,low,"I am very much helpful by this topic that successful people try new things and try to take risks .
In my view success is not a one word game , it is defined by many ways at different level of life .
A man got success simply is a dull man in every sence .
Taking new thigs at level at different part of life is a interesting phenomena of life , i8n which a man need of interest can increase level by level .
A person of a good deed always crazy about good feed .

In life everybody should have position on which a person can be incharge by its own .
Taking risk is not showing a stupidity of a person it shows that how much you careful about your life .
In life there are so many situation occur where we find nothing exept blankness around ourself at that time we have no time to think on other environmet , so at time we take risk at any cost .
Some get feared by taking risk , but at that time they forget that daythey have to do same activity at any level of our life .
Many people try risk for there name and many person for reasonable activity .

Foe example , if a person starts a business then he or she may taking risk at that program , this person has nothig to gain at initial level of there activty , so at that time only hard work and determination proceed him up .
Likewise they get up wiyh new confidence at every step of there life .

So we can now mention that successful person trying new thing and taking risk for there better tomorrow and there better life .
If a person do well alone without trying not too much is not learn so much from there life , and that was not include there profile at high level .

Thats why people need trying new thnigs .

11753,1935243.txt,P1,SPA,high,"I agree with the statement `` It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . ''
.

First , a broader knowledge of many academic subjects enables an individual to be diverse : being involved in different projects , conversations , and work groups .
By concentrating on one single subject specifically , a person might always be involved with the same people , performing the same tasks , and thinking in a similar way .
By having knowledge , as broad as it might be , of different subjects , an individual is rescued from monotony and involved in interesting and dynamic conversations and group work .

Let us say that a student is specializing in biology .
If he only works on this specific academic subject he might grow tired of having the same conversations and working on the same types of projects .
If , on the other hand , he included some subjects on engineering and arts , for example , he would get involved in different conversations , making his life more interesting and helping him grow , maybe even in the area of his preference , biology .

Second , knowledge of many different subjects enables one to know , identify , and appreciate the connection and relationship between different subjects .
This is especially important in problem solving .
For example , a specialist in manufacturing processes might normally deal with problems related to equipment , tolerances , and procedures .
Faced with a problem not related to what he would normally deal with , this person might feel overwhelmed and not know how to deal with the problem .
However , if this individual decided to acquire a general knowledge about logistics , administration , and human resources he might know , at least , what direction to take in order to solve the problem .

Knowing an array of different academic subjects in a broad level compared to specializing on a specific subject , ensures diversity , scope expansion and more developed problem solving skills .

10387,1692529.txt,P7,ITA,medium,"I truly convinced that the relation between `` ideas '' and `` facts '' is so strict that it does not make sense to discuss wheter it is more important for students to understand concepts or facts .

I am engineer and during my own experience I can provide some example to explain better what I think about this issue .
One of the most difficult course is Optical Communication , there are thousand equations to explain the trasmission of an optical signal from one point to another , I read the book and payed attention to all the lessons but althought all the mathematical implications were cleared to me , I was not able to apply them and in that semester I failed to pass the exam , I did not understand the reason for my failure after all I knew all the concepts .
I decided to ask my problems to the professor who took me immidiatly to the communication lab , showing all the applications of what I supposed to know .
Thought that experience , learning `` facts '' I deeply understand the main points of the course and passed exam in a relative simply way .
In this case the concepts could not provide me all the necessary information to a full understanding .

Sometimes could happen the countrary , we can start from theory to understand a fact .
Everyone knows the story of Newton , one red apple on his head represents and important fact : Newton learnt this facts and starting from that he introduced the concept of `` gravitation '' settin up ideas and concepts in order to explain that facts .

Galileo Galilei , one of the most famous scientist in the history , deals with the importance to support ideas and concepts with facts and experiments that could be replicated several times in order to very and prove the validity of a theory .

In conclusion I think that ideas and facts are two aspects of the same `` world '' and one can not claim that one aspect is more important than the other , but indeed they live toghter .
In my opinion a good student has to pay attention to both of these two aspects if he or she wants to have a full understant of an event .

12069,1993586.txt,P5,ITA,medium,"Many studies have shown that using of cars have a strong impact on environment pollution .
However , it can be understood in our everyday life that the number of cars is rising .
For example , some years ago it took fifteen minutes to reach my office while now it takes at least half an hour .
Even when we listen politicians speaking about how to work the problem of cars pollution out , noboby seems to take into consideration the possibility to reduce the number of cars .
They rather seems to put much weight on alternative solutions , such as finding a new kind of essence or pushing people to use electric cars .

Personally , I do not believe that this situation will change in the future .
First of all , using a car is easier and more comfortable that use public transports .
People do not have to deal with timetables or bus stops .
They can decide on their own when and where to leave .
Secondly , cities are becoming bigger and bigger .
So , even if two persons have to go to the same city they need to have two cars .
As a matter of fact , in Milan , for example , it takes at least one hour to go from one part of the city to another .
Finally , people need to move to more distant places for working , studing or meeting their friends .
It is less stresfull to use a car than take a train , then a bus and a taxi .

In conclusion , I do not believe that the number of cars will decrease in the future .
The only way to achieve that would be would be to forbid the using of cars .

In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , since the population is increasing , and that will cause a lot of traffic problems such as crowded street , and the way of transportation .
We can solve this problem by using trains and planes more than cars .
In the other hand , people will not buy cars more if they face a lot of trafic crowd .
While the population is increasing , I think there will be a new laws , and restriction of using cars .
Also , the tax will increase on the people who have more than enough of cars in their home .

11971,1973171.txt,P2,HIN,high,"Whether one enjoys or not , depends mostly on the individuals definition of enjoyment .
If a person finds one work interesting , he/she will drive immense enjoyment in doing it , even though the same job might appear extremely drab to another person .

In order to do justice to the statement made here , we need to understand how the preferences of young and old people differ in terms of their activities .
This statement seems to be written by a young person who feels that his/her present pursuits of vibrant physical activities , adventures and long vacations spent in travelling to exciting destinations are his sole source of enjoyment .
Because he feels that he might not be able to do these things in advanced age , older age might be boring in all respects .

However looking from the perspective of an old person , having lived his/her younger life in constant activity , lot more enjoyment is found in doing the other kind of things .
These can be small little things like reading books , soaking sun in the garden , gardening , playing with children and the like .
We need to understand here that it is not that they have to do this , but because they choose to do this which in turn is simply because they enjoy doing it .

I am not generalising all the elder people as dormant personalities who indulge in less physical activities .
There are cases that one comes across in which people in old age resolve to do something very demanding in physical terms just because they could not do it when they were younger , and they feel that doing it would bring them lot of satisfaction and enjoyment .
Thereby we have stories of some 60-70 year old trying their hands at trekking or a cross-country run .

I agree that there can be cases where a person might become physically unfit to take up an activity that he would really want to .
This might happen more often in old age , but we need not forget that young people are not completely excluded from that .
There can be cases where people in young age are incapacitated in various aspects as well .
But even in such cases one will surely engage oneself in some activity that he/she might eventually end up enjoying a lot .

It is apt to mention here that enjoyment emanates from an initial emotion of accomplishment .
When one feels having made an accomplishment in any field , he/she starts ` enjoying ' it .

To conclude , I wish to reiterate that enjoyment and happiness are a state of mind and matter of personal choice rather than absolute entities .
Hence to say that criterion of age , sex , education , opportunities and the like will bar someone from ` enjoying ' , is not correct .

1110,182475.txt,P5,ZHO,high,"Do you think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today ?
People hold different views on this issue .
Actually , this topic is so complex and controvesial that it deserves careful consideration .
In my opinion , I think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

To begin with , the first reson to illustrate my point is that people will take public transportation system more often than today .
Rather than driving cars by themselves , people would take bus or Mass Rapid Transit System to their destination for it is more convenient .
Take my home city Taipei for example .
Instead of being caught in the traffic jam during rush hours , people in Taipei prefer taking Mass Rapid Transit System to commute .
I think this will be a trend in the future .

In addition , the further aregument to strenghten my position is that not using cars is an effective and efficient way to save energy and reducing pollution .
For fear of depleting the prcious energy in the globe , it is wiser to do our best to save energy .
Moreover , to maintain a good and suitable environment , reducing both air and noise pollution by not using cars is a good method .
Since environment conservation is an important issue nowadays , I think not using cars is quite important .

Finally , another reason to reinforce my view is that taking public transportation system is much more economical than driving cars , Actually , maintaining a car is quite expensive .
Besides the expense of purchasing a car , it costs a lot to maintain and repair it .
Moreover , you have to spend a lot of time as well as money for parking your car .
On the countrary , taking public transportation system is quite smart .
Therefore , I believe more and more people will choose taking public transportation system in the future .

In conclusion , for the reasons mentioned above , I firmly believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

9464,1522092.txt,P3,TUR,high,"Every grandmother talks about the good-old days , when the younger were more helpful the old ones , respectful for family values and community culture .
Well , somebody has to tell them back that the times have changed !
I agree that young people are not like in the old times , because they are more individualistic , they have less time for family and community but more for work .
Also the old ones have changed !
They are more healthy and socially active , so they do not need younger ones as they did in the past .

First of all , everbody will accept that we are now living in a society where everyone lives an individual life , rather than as a part of a community .
This individuality has physical aspects and also cultural aspects .
For example , the number of people working in cities or even countries different then where their family live , is going higher and higher every year .
How can somebody be helpful to his community , if he is 1000 miles away ?
This is physically not possible .
And culturally , with all the media and advertisement bombardment telling the people that the only important thing in this life is themselves but nothing else ; how can young people not be individual caring about only their own lives ?

The times have also changed in terms of the time which we must spend for things other than family isues .
Young people have to spend much of their time in their school and work .
They can not even find enough time to deal with all these , actually .
That results in less time for the family and community again .

Lastly , the old ones also changed !
They are healthier , and socially more active than they used to be .
They need the younger ones less and less by the advances in technology also .
Which means it is not only the younger ones that have changed .

The world we live in is certainly different than what it had been before .
One of the results is that younger people are not into their comunities as much as they did in the past .
They are more individualistic , they have less time , and actually the older ones needs them less , too .

4219,733349.txt,P2,TUR,high,"During our lifecycle , we encounter different periods due to our age and we have to obey to bear certain roles .
We try to make a promising future in our younger period whereas we bear more responsibility in our older period .
But when it comes to enjoying life , does younger people have more fun compared to the older people ?
I think not , even though it seems so .

In younger periods of life , we will be persisting , keeping on trying to make a promising `` future '' for ourselves .
Every progress in means of academic performance of fields of business is for making a basis for our future .
In short , we invest , to gain a future .
Furthermore , we have less responsibilities , which may seem to be priceless for many people but not for me .
Having less responsibilities means that you have less control and effect in your life .
When you are a child , your mum will buy your clothes , chooses the meals you eat and even takes stesp in your early academic life .
So , you are dependent on your family in your early lifetime .
As you grow and become older you will increase the span of your responsibilities .

Additionally , younger people lack may be the most important aspect of success and survival in life : experience .
Younger people are worse in decision making and successing in every field they are introduced to as new .

Does being young has nothing to have fun ?
Absolutely there are some .
You can party like crazy , live being dependent on your family and pay no care .
Everything seems to be in order and you do not have to deal with that , then why not just have fun of it ?
As I mentioned earlier , this is an illusionary situation and one have to know that his/her family will not take care of him forever , so he/she has to invest for his/her future .

When we look into life through the older stages of lifecycle , everything is established and in order .
We `` harvest '' our investment of younger periods and have fun of it .
We have established what we dreamed of and we have reached the point , the point of success in our heads .
Therefore , I thing one will be satisfied with his/her life in their older periods .
Now , we have the responsibility of our life , even the lives of our children or others , like our employees .

Another point is that we have the most experience in our older periods , we know how to study , how to be persistent to reach goals and even how to have the most fun out of life !

To conclude , I strictly reject the idea of being younger means enjoying life more .
In my opinion , being younger means that you are an unexperienced , unestablished passenger of the travel through life ; whereas being older means that you are experienced and you are established .
The advantages I have stated throughout this essay of of being older will lead to enjoying life more than the younger ones .

4070,706969.txt,P2,JPN,high,"Some people say that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
However , where I live , older people are very healthy and acitive than they used to .
In my opinion , older people enjoy more life than younger people do .

The first reason of this is that because older people have more time and money than their couterparts , they can do a lot of activities they want to .
For example , my parents are both retired .
They have a lot of free time than I have .
In addition , they worked for more than 35 years , so they have a large amount of money they can spend .
That 's why they travel almost once a month across my country and they have already visited all the prefectuers in my country .
On the contrary , I have to work every day and I have less available time and money since I got a job last year .
I was not able to go somewhere even in summer vacation .

Another reason is that young people have more concerns about their futures , compared to the optimistic opinions showed by older people , which leads to the young people 's negative ideas about their lives in general .
One illustration that makes this clear is that most of the young people concerns about their pensions they will receive in the future .
Now that the aging society in my country is getting serious , young people may not receive enough money to live on after their retirement .
Therefore , most of them have to save money for their future lives and they can not afford to enjoy their present lives .

My consideration with respect to the available time and money as well as the negative ideas about future lives , I think that older people enjoy life more than younger people do .
"
1834,316566.txt,P2,TEL,high,"`` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
My decision to agree or disagree on this topic might depend a lot on the definitions of young people and old people .
Let us decide , for the sake of clarity that a young person is someone who is below the age of 25 , who is still in undergraduate college and older people are people above the age of 50 who have achieved financial securities in their lives and are about to attain their retirement age .
Still with this definition too , its hard to actually quantify enjoyment .
Looking at the situtation from a broader perspective though , I would sure say that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Let me put forward a case which might explain my point in detail .

Take for example , the things that young people do in their leisure time .
They hang around with their girl friends / boy friends and other close friends , they party out , they go for movies , discotheques and they take pleasue from all sorts of entertainments available on this planet .
On the other hand , you would n't expect the same behaviour from older people .
They would rather stay at home and enjoy the pleasure and warmth the home has to provide .
Sipping by the sunday afternoon 's tea , eating biscuits , watching their grandsons play in the garden is how many old people visualize their leisure time to be spent .
They have actually witnessed a lot in the 50 years span of their lives , that these little things in nature bring a great deal of enjoyment to them than anything else .

Also , older people benefit a great deal through their experience .
They know how the world works .
They are better equiped with dealing the ups and downs of life .
Also , they have financial security and are more cautious in the decisions they make .
Thus , a great deal of your happiness depends on these small things in life .
Older people are better organized in sorting out these small things in life .
On the other hand , most youth are in a confused state of mind .
They 're still maturing day by day learning how cruel the world can be at times .
Also , they are not financially secure .
Young people often take decisions in haste for which they repent later .

Thus , as we have seen above , `` enjoyment '' depends a great deal on how it is quantified and defined .
It rather depends on a particular individual as to whether he has enjoyed his life more in his youth or when his hairs turned grey .
But it so happens , that your best years are your undergraduate years when you study in college and are away from your parents .
This is the time where you meet new people and foster relations that you remember them for the rest of your life .

So looking objectively at the situation , young people can get a great deal out of life than their older counterparts can .

6614,1078009.txt,P8,TUR,medium,"The New Things
I agree if you try new things and take more risk you can achieve your goals and earn big moneys .
I am talking abaout money because my major is a international trade in my university and i would like to do this business buying an d selling somethings .
I know how to do this job but i think trying new things for instance you can buy another product and you can change it and sell .
It has more risk , may be you can not sell cahanged product .

Successfull people in my country always trying new things for their goal .
They are sometimes loosing but if they win , they would have more profit .
For example , Its a biggest turkish company .
First its a shoe company , they produce shoes and export it .
They know how to do well shoes .
One day the owner who has a company tried another things they sell all of his property ( his factory , his business , his car , etc . )
And he bought a land for produce onion .
He doesnt know anything about how to produce onion , how to sell . ?
ts like a gambling .
He found a farmer who is living in a rural place .
He helped to produce onion and selling process .
And they found small packages for onions .
For example 1pound , 3 pounds packages and they sold directly markets .
It makes more profitable and more usefull for consumers .
And he has a onion brand name .
Now the ex shoe producer has a big onion 's farms and he earns 1 billion dollar a year , he is exporting onions all over the world its a big deal .

In my opinion trying new things and take a risks are not good for everyone because you need a little bit good luck in your business life .

Now im a Physic , and the most part of my personal world is ruled by mathematical laws , equallities , operators and overwhelming logic .
I know this things cause my college professors taught me to smart-thinking by making me undertanding all from the basics , i.e : nothing about memmory but yes in understanding .
This was a brief and personal explanaiton of why i am totally agree with the statement , now i will focus on reasons and examples to support my answer .
Firstly , facts are of course useless if it have not a concept or idea within ( Newton and the apple falling is a ridiculous fact if Newton wasnt explained all with his Newtonian Mechanics theory , when we see that exists a force field called gravity ) .

Of course facts are sometimes funny o funniest than an explanation of a concept , but talking in terms of use or importance , concepts wins .
Imagine an example of a sciences student , to be more accurate a biology one ; in the college a professor says to his students that human body is made from water and carbon basically , its ok , but this is only a fact that contains only a partial true .
The idea of the human body is the community of a lot of organisms living together to mutual advantage that are called cells , of course these cells are made of water and carbon , but that is only the fact that a lot of living units conforming the human body are chemical composed by water and carbon , the idea is that carbon and water could create different types of microscopic structures depending on his molecular structure giving place to the formation of cells .

Well , if the student only knew that human body is made of carbon and water , nowadays organ transplants would be impossible , a lot of modern medical threatments also would be imposible , genetic therapy also would be impossible too , only cause we knew a partial true instead the big one .

8556,1347087.txt,P4,ITA,medium,"I think that the idea that most advertisements make products seem much better than they are is right .
In fact advertising is made for the purpose of push people to buy a product even when it is not needed .
To do so the good has to seem much more better than what it really is .
The funny thing is that the mismatching between what is advertised and the real product is openly declared everywhere as it could be read in small fonts that the object can be different than how is picted on the advertising or the box .

An example is when drugs are advertised on television .
They show someone that feels sick and as soon as the little pill is swallowed he or she gets back to work as nothing has appened .
I guess this could be dangerous too .

Another example is when in a fast food restaurant there are pictures that show wonderful hamburgers that do not look like the hamburgers I get to eat .
I also remember when I was a little boy and I saw an advertising about an ice-cream on TV .
The ice-cream looked so good that I felt that I had to have one .
As soon as I could I went to buy that ice cream , but when I unwrapped it and I saw how the ice cream was in the real life I felt like a fool and got very disappointed .

As a conclusion I think that when we look at advertised product we should do it with criticism and be aware of the differences between pictures and real life .

I see those advantages of travel with a group using a tour guide :
- You do n't have to lost time in move from a place to other place ,
- You can share your own experience with other people with the same objective ,
- Do n't get worry about get lost or be in dangerous places ,
- Do n't have troubles with the language ,
- Make your days easy , because somebody else is explaining what you have in front of your face .

Advantages about travel by yourself :
- Know people from the city ,
- See more the village , walk next to the people , take the same air , eat the same food ,
- Tried to learn a language using some of their words ,
- Be a traveller where to learn their culture will be the first objective of your travel ,
- Ask where and how to know more about the city .

I traveled as part of a group using a tour guide and was just a bad experience .
You are so rigid to any wish or activity you would like to do by yourself , for example : when you are travelling with a group you have all the activities and the time depends of other person .
There are travels organized by time where you only get a city go to touristic places and go back .
You are travelling as as tourist .

I will prefer always to travel as a traveller , that makes you more fun in your travel , you know more the city , the people , the culture and brief more the air of the city or place you are visiting .
I was travelling a couple of time in Rome , the first time was with myself , i took a guide then i was walking around the city and see all the touristic places and eat in italians small restaurants .
Thats was wonderful , i meet italians that then invited me to eat to their house to see an italian house , how they were living .

With a group you will only listen some experience but not livinng those experience .
I like to travel a lot and always i tried to travel with myself or not more to a friend in this way we can enjoy and share our opinions .
Only we need a backpack , camera and documents ...
Oh and money will help a lot .

11816,1945717.txt,P5,ITA,medium,"I personally believe that the number of cars will increase in the following twenty years .
The only thing that may inhibit this trend is a strong committment , supported by all the important Countries , to the safety of the environment .

I will try to support my opinion considering the following arguments :
- urbanistic patterns ;
- `` car habits '' evolution ;
- the distribution of wealth ;
- other means of transport 's trend ;
- purpose for which people move ;
- last , but not less important , individual economic conditions .

Urbanistic patterns
Cities are changing shape and numerous studies and researches state that in twenty years nearly 90 % of the population will leave in city areas .
This might increase the need of cars .
A limitation would be given by local laws intended to manage the trafic , for example inhibiting the access to downtown .

`` Car habits '' evolution Technology is helping to make cars into in more and more efficient means of transport , with lower cost than in the past .
This might increse the number of people who can afford to buy a car .

This point is strictly connected with that of the `` distribution of wealth '' .

The evolution of the other means of transport is strictly linked with politics and the big issues tackled by governaments .
If Governaments choose to enlarge public spending supporting the constructions of trains , subways , and all the other `` public '' means of transport , people will be offered an alternative to the car , but if Governaments miss this point , cars will still be used as a preferential way to move from one place to another .

Another point is the reason why people move , that might be business , leisure , etc ..
In the last few years the number of people moving for leisure purpose is increasing and this , combined with the fear to move away from home due to recent terroristic attacks , may increase the use of cars .

All of this is true only if individual economic conditions remain those of today ( or even better ) .
But if this does n't happen , there will be no money for cars .
Perhaps no money for anything !

4569,792202.txt,P2,HIN,high,"I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

Young people are usually healthier than old people and are full of zest and energy .
Good health opens a lot of avenues for enjoyment to the youth .
They can go bungee jumping or sky diving if they please so .
Frail health limits the aged .
They have to think twice before performing even routine activities of life .

A lot of fun involves medium to high risk .
At a young age , people are able to take a lot of risks in life .
There is very less at stake for them .
And that is also how they learn .
However at an advanced age , it becomes very difficult to take even medium risks and the aged prefer to shun such activities which would involve risk .
How many times would anyone have seen grandma riding a motorbike ?

The young are more curious than the aged .
Hence experiencing new things is a source of joy and fun for the youth .
However the `` worldly wise '' aged has seen it all in life and there is rarely a thing which can excite them the way it excites the youth .

While young , people have a better ability to change .
The young are tuned into the times .
The elderly usually find it difficult to adapt to the changes of the current times .
For example , there are not many elderly who are comfortable with the latest technology and gizmos like the computer and the ipod .

Lastly the world is geared to cater to the needs of the young .
Besides medical care and certain specialized products for the aged , the TV is full of advertisements targetting the youth and children .
A visit to the malls , restuarants , pubs , entertainment parks and movies reiterates the same focus on the youth .
The entire economy churns out billions of dollars catering to the whims and fancies of the youth .

Hence young people definitely have more fun than the elderly .

6104,1035126.txt,P4,KOR,high,"I think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
There are two reasons for my opinion : the pupose of the advertisements is to sell the products , and the audiences do not see directly the products on their eyes .

First , the purpose of the advertisements makes the goods seem much better .
The advertisement company should present the goods to sell , not to show the virtue and vice of the goods .
When people see the advertisement , the goods seem perfect and make people the happiest person in the world .
When I was a middle school students , I really wanted to buy a new computer ; I actually did not have good knowledge of the computer .
When I watched a fabulous advertisement of a computer , I pursuaded my parents to buy the computer on the advertisement .
Finally , my parents accepted my seggestion and bought me that computer .
However , I found out my new computer used not genuin programs on the computer .
I pursuaded my parents with the computer because the computer had everything looks best even though it was very cheap .
I was very disappointed about the advertisements which described their products as the best at that time .

Second , the audiences does not see directly see the products on their eyes .
People say that the goods on the picture or the TV look different when they see it directly .
My sister had a similar situation recently .
She bought a bag on the website which looked fine .
However , she did not even recognize the bag because the color of the bag was different from the picture on the website .
It was not the seller 's fault but the camera 's fault .
I read an article related to these happening ; Seeing an object on the picture and seeing the object on the naked eye are different because the camera lens produce the photo with mixing red , yellow and blue which cause distortion of colors .
Moreover , the advertisement companies devise the best angle of imposing lights on the product that the product looks better .
This problem means that people should not precisly judge a product only according to the image presented on the picture or the TV .

Depends on my experiences and scientific knowledges , it is clear that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
I hope that the advertisement companies try to show the virtue and the vice of their products rather than only show and exaggerate the quality of the products .
Moreover , I wish that scientists invent more accurate way of taking picture or recording that the audiences can face the goods more accurately .

This is one important succes that the modern society has achieve , making possible a lot of facts than traditionally were n't able to all those families .

Cars make our life really easier .
Since every family could own a car the distances between cities and towns have been reduced and it 's really easier to visit places , go to job faster , carry things , etc .
It 's unimaginable a world without cars .
But in the other hand we have to think how those machines has contributed to the global warming .
The use of petroleum and poluted gases increases the toxic air and afects our world enviroment .
We also have to think about all the wars and global problems that this need of petroleum has created .

Today there are too many cars in the streets .
The life on the cities is turning very dificult because is so common to use a car that there is no space in the cities to allow them .
The air is turning difficult to breath and every day more people are going to live outside the cities because of these polution .
The public transport is n't answering the people 's needs .
They are overcrawded and many times arrives late wherever you go .

9272,1481416.txt,P7,FRA,high,"This debate puts the theoretical approach of studies into question .
What is the value of facts and do they really stimulate students imagination ?

To me , ideas and concepts have two complementary effects on students .
On the one hand they make it possible to have a real ground for philosophical thoughts : they help us to understand our society and the evolution of our ways of thinking .
They also stimulate our creativity and our ability to criticize but they obviously ask efforts that can discourage most of students .
On the other hand they help us to make our own opinion .
For example the economists ( from Friedman to Marx and Jean-Baptiste Say ) that are studied give their subjective views on the question `` how society and business must be run ? '' and the economic concepts surrounding their way of thinking allow students to find their own opinion .

On the contrary , facts are already opinions because they are expressions of opinions .
Their interpretation can be very dangerous .
For example the way the historical strain between Japan and China is perceived by students from both countries acknowledges the fact that historical events are both objective and subjective ...
and the teacher 's clout on students minds can become dangerous .

I think that ideas first bring debates whereas facts lead to other facts .
Of course students critizice the point in having a theoretical approach of concepts but the system seems nowadays appropriate : if we do n't take social backgrounds into account , you see that the longer you go to school , the more the courses become factual ( from school to undergraduate schools to MBA programs that make you take decisions and use exemples to lead your management abilities )

To conclude I would like to say , as a student , that facts are more interesting to hear , more captivating and Socrate already showed from its cavern with shadows that appearance is confusing .

It 's quite usual to see that several young people hanging out in a pub or a football field , but it 's unusually to see they are appearing at community centres or a aged person 's back yard to help him/her to clean .

The world is becoming more attractive to young people than ever before .
The internet , various computer games , gaming consoles , fancy toys and etc. have been taking a lot of time from the young generation .
Compared to the past , young people used to spend more time on studying , and also more time on participating community activities , and helping and learning from each other .

The relationship between people , especially in urban areas , are getting far more looser than before , which partially causes young generation are more relying on themselves than on the neighbourhood .
Everyone is busying on their own stuff and trying to make more money to get so called better life while ignoring the importance of the communities that they belong to .

Family teaching may be another reason why young people prefer staying away from others .
Lots of facts showed that our society are not becoming safer .
Instead , we are seeing moer and more criminals reported everyday , our neighbourhood are no long a safe place to be .
Lots of parents are more likely to leave their children at home while they are busying on their own business .
From very young , children learnt to play with themselves at home , and to spent their time at home .

To conclude , young people should be taught to engage in more community activities which will help them to understand an important part of lives , which is to help others to make the society more beautiful .

4951,863679.txt,P7,DEU,high,"At first is to say both ways are important for students .
You have to learn facts sometimes but also you have to understand ideas and concepts in general .
I would say you can really understand concepts if you have learnt a few facts before .
I imagine to be a student in information technology .
How could I understand the requirements and the development of a secure and professional working IT network for a company e.g. , without exactly knowledge of the features and performance of the components for such a network , both hardware components and software components ?
In my oppinion the learning of facts is often the basis to go the next steps .
Only if I have achieved a very good level of detailed knowledge , a very good level of known facts and information I will be able to think in higher dimensions and to understand the context and goal of this descriped ideas and concepts .
The experience from practice will support the ability to create successful concepts .

To talk about another example .
I have to develop a marketing concept for a special new product .
How can I do this without knowing how the product works , what the consumer requires and so on .
In other words , before I can develop marketing concepts I should have sold a few products , I should have talked to a few consumers of the regarding market segment .
I should also have done a few market research to learn the most important topics about competitors .
All this `` to do '' can be descriped as learning of facts , either learning in theory or learning in practice .
Both ways of learning facts are very important to be successfull later in understanding and also creating ideas and concepts .
So as a summary I would say it is not the question what is more important , learning facts or understand concepts but it is the question what comes as first .
I am sure both of them are very important

10488,1711804.txt,P4,ITA,high,"I absolutely agree with the fact that many advertisements make products seem special , even though , maybe , they are not .
I understand that the purpose of an advertisement is to actually show the product with its best qualities , but I think that many times this is n't really what is done .

First of all , it is frequent that the advertisement presents the product as the best one on the market , comparing it with other similar types in commerce .
For example , there are dish washing soaps that are presented as miracolous , but I do n't think that they would actually be able to dissolve all the grease and dirt on a frying pan , after the preparation of a bacon and eggs breakfast .

In addition , behind the preparation of an advertisement there are many people , such as designers for graphics , music experts for the sound and so on .
All these persons work to make the advertisement as appealing as possible .
They know the target of people who to direct , and who will probably be the future buyers , and consequently study a way to show the product that will be specially interesting for those .

The third reason why I think that advertisements are not always straightforward is that many companies decide to pay a famous person , such as an actor or a singer , to make their product more popular .
In this way all the fans of this person would be encouraged to buy what he or she is presenting .
I think that no woman on earth could resist from buying a jewel presented next to Brad Pitt 's face .

In conclusion , I think that people should be aware of these strategies and decide wether to buy the product or not just thinking by themselves , ignoring the sometime `` false '' advertisements .

2767,481560.txt,P3,JPN,medium,"Today in Japan , I think some young people dont help their communities .
I think it is because they are not interesting in their lives .
Some people say that they dont have much time to spend helping communities but I think those are just the reason why they dont want to do it .

Some communities have some problems .
I think the most biggest common problem is the environment .
I am interested in these environment so I do want to know about these problems and want to think what i can do for communities .
These environment problems are very important today i think , because those are depending on our lives and they are relative to our future lives .
So I think that people have to consider about these problems again of course , but young people should be in mind these problems becasue young people will make our future life so that they should give enough time to helping thier comminuties .
These a little helping can make our communities better .

Having siad that , some people against my idea because studying or playing sports or doing what they like are also important .
However , I think young people can give more time to helping considering their communities because young people 's infuluences are very big so that if they more pay attention to their community , i think their communities will be better .

First of all man y parents do not let thier children to to experiment how it feels good when they help thier communities becouse parents think that helping community is a waste of time .

Having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is it better than specializing in one specific subject ?
We 're going to give our opinion in an argumentative essay .

During our life we 're going to school to get more and more knowledge for being able to face on any situation , is evident for me that having knowledge of many academic subjects is more efficient that having only one about one specific subject .

Having knowlegde is getting teaching from differents experiences during our life , whenever is at school , at home , in our social life or religious life .
We can get advantages in knowing something about litterature , mathematics , geology , history , music , politic , geography , phylosophia and so on , because if you know something even if is not really well about these subjects , your mind is opening on every type of subjects .
For example if you have to pass and exam which is about general culture , it 's clear that knowing some points about litterature , history of US , World War 2 , the origin of opera , and other subjects is more beneficial for you , you have more chance to pass easily the exam compared to another person who know everything about one subjects , for example if he know only everything about French Litterature , he ca n't talk with someone about sport , music or cinema .

People who have a broad knowledge of many subjects ca n't be usefull in any types of situations , and they 're not handicaped by their knowledge , we can say that they 're an good and efficient help for the society , because they can come help someone who is in bad situation , for example if someone has been burned by a cigarett , the person who get a knowledge of many subjects , can help him .

As i write this essay , I would like to explain to the readers why specializing in a certain field is a good idea .

Eventhough it is important to have wide range of knowledges , it would be pointless if you do not know how to use them wisely .
Your knowledge from different fields could spread out all over the place and lead you to nothing .
That is the last thing you would like it to happen .

For example , learning different kinds of languages .
You know basic greetings and could understand typical everyday conversations in five different languages might make you feel smart .

In other words , you can not have a carreer using those knowledges .

In conclusion , I would like to strongly state that to be specialized in one specific subject would help lead you to have a successful carreer .
In other words , a brighter future .
The more knowledge you have , the better .

3180,551371.txt,P2,DEU,high,"In order to gain an opinion on the statement `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' , I would have to first observe typical activities of both age groups .
I would then have to come up with a system to measure enjoyment .
The latter I am not capable of incorporating in such a short format , so that I am going to analize typical activities and - where appropriate - associate a value with them .

What do young people like to do ?
They travel , they like to consume fashion and music , they study and they do sports - and very often all at the same time .
They certainly have the physical abilities to do so .
Not quite as often do they have the funding .
If indeed they do n't , they like to spend big portions of their time in front of the television or computer , watching shows , surfing the internet or playing video games .
Often , these media represent a world , that these people would enjoy even more than their own lives .

If young people do not do , what they `` like '' to do , they are usually too busy to enjoy life .
Older people are not busy .
They have time and money to travel , enjoy culture , and do sports .
But all of that they can only do , if they are still healthy and active enough .
Otherwise they like to fall into patterns similar to the ones described do .
Often , these patterns involve TV or crossword-puzzles .

By sarcastically creating prototypes of young and older people , I am expressing an opinion that is beyond agreement or disagreement with the opening statement .
None of the groups enjoys life more than the other .
It all depends on the individuals and what they make out of their living situation .
"
7161,1129532.txt,P2,HIN,medium,"Most people think that enjoyment comes from experience , but in my opinion , when we first experience something we enjoy it more .
There is a saying that a thing is attractive untill you get it , in other words , when you wish for something and do not get it easily , you are more keen to get it .
After getting that thing , you loose your interest in it .
This is the human nature .
So the meaning is that younger people enjoy their life more than older , because they experience things for very first time .
I also agree with this opinion that young persons enjoy life more than older people .

To support my opinion , firstly , I would like to disscuss the tendency or the nature of youngers .
First of all , they are very curious about new things .
They want to explore everything regardless of danger associated with it .

For example , when I was a kid , I was always curious about parachute , and one day what happened , I just jumped from my roof top with an umbrella .
At that time I did not know , what is fear .
So meaning is that , you can not expect this kind of absurd behavior from an older person .
Even , if an old person does not know the harm associated with the task , he/she might not take risk .

Secondly , youth do not care for moral values , whereas old people do follow them strictly .
From their experience of life , senior people know the value of ethics and would like to follow always .
On the other hand , teenagers are unlikely to follow the moral values , or they follow reluctantly .

Thirdly , In my opinion , you can enjoy the life if you do n't have restriction on you activities .
Old people have resposibilities towards society , as well as towards their own family .
While youngers are free to do whatever they want .
For an instance , I like to dance publically , and I do whenever I get chance to do it .
But I know some older people can not do it because first they think about others opinion such as , what would the society think , or what would be the impact on children .

Last but not the least , young people are always open to new ideas or cultures , while older people have narrow mind .
It is easy for a younger to adapt a new culture in order to learn it .
On the other hand , senior persons are rigid to their own culture in order to preserve it .

Conclusion is that , although it is true that older people enjoy life based on their own life time experiences , I strongly hold the view that youngers enjoy the life more than them .
The main reasons are , will to explore new things , no responsibility , less regard for values or ethics , and more energy to enjoy life .

`` Young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
Absolutely , you are not an exception . ''
I agree the statement my grandmother because of the following reasons .

First of all , young people like to hang out themselves .
In other words , they do not share their thinking and behavior their communities and do not spend time their communities .
Let 's recall `` Friends '' , the most famous sitcom in the world which there are three women and three guys .
During their 20's and 30's , they just hang out themselves .
I do not see an episodes which above characters have spent the time with their communities .

Secondly , young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their communities because they think cyber communites more valuable than real their communities .
In my case , I am an active member of Korea Volunteer Teaching Program for kids .
But I do not know my neighborhoods and their children .
Owing to technological development and novices , young people are familiar with global issues and internet world and their interest are not limited in thier communities .

Lastly , I would like say that community it self become more isolated and individual .
A hundreds years ago , people depended on each other and they were a huge family .
But , there are no dependence , cooperation , respect for senior and original tradition in modern society .

To sum up , I agree with the statement that young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their communities for these reaseons ; they do not like spending the time with their communities , they are familiar with cyber comminities than their neighbor and modern society is differerent from past society .

To read the appropriate books , to listen carefully , to make notes and finally to recollect the learned information in an exam or paper .
But are the needed information only learned by conscious or are they understood and still available in our minds after the test ?

If a course consists only of learning facts and figures , then for sure the students will forget pretty soon what it was about .
But if they need to understand ideas and concepts they will be kept in mind once they 've been learned .

Despite the importance of understanding the information and concepts , in many courses it is still necessary to learn figures and facts to get a background knowledge about the topic .
As long as the balance between learning and understanding is kept , there is no problem with it .
But if the learning overwhelmes , the student might get bored of the stuff and demotivated .
The risk of giving up is high then .

Moreover it is very important that a student can realize how to use the learned concepts in praxis .
That point also stands for understanding ideas .
But if the idea or concept is very complex and the student did n't get it right , he might stay behind and ca n't follow the course any longer .
Especially if the following builds on the known concept .

In my opinion it is indeed more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts , because things I 've once understood I would n't forget again .
Moreover it gives me the feeling of success if I understand the way it works .
For sure I also have to learn theoretical facts for my study but I think it 's more important if I can use the facts I 've learned as a base for going further in understanding a concept .

To sum up I would say that a combination of both , the understanding and the learning process is optimal for a successful study .

3280,569370.txt,P6,JPN,medium,"i disagree with this statement .
it is because , there are sme reasons .
one of the reason that if we traveled in a group and led by a tour guide , we could not get a interrests to plan that where want to go and where want to stay .
usually the tour had some schedules and there were no private thing .
all of the time we have to spend time with other people who did not know .
you may say to make new friend is very good thing but not always we can spend wonderful time with them .
i think that the travel that go with the people who are understanding eachother very well is better .
the tour guid is very usehul to travel , but we have to allow the rules of the tour that i do not want to .
i want to travel more freelly and i want to make a lot of memories by my own style .

and the next reason that by my experiment .
last mounth i went to Hokkaido for the school trip with my class mates and we use a bus all three days ofcause with a tour guide .
before the trip we had a lot of plans for the trip but the school trip had to allow the school style which had a lot of rules .
we went to some plece with her and we were told many things by the tour guide , but i felt that it was not to interest .
i felt that if we could plan the schedules of the trip might be we could made more oridinal memories of the trip .

because of this i disagree with this statement .

"
2908,503814.txt,P7,DEU,high,"To me this statement seems reasonable because ideas and concepts are necessary to understand why something is as it is and how it developed .
Concepts and ideas connect facts , describe and explain their relationship to each other and make processes understandable .
Furthermore they enable students to think beyond what is observable , to cast a light on related issues , analyse facts and developments or to make predictions or suggestions for the future .
Thus , concepts and ideas are theoretical approaches to the observable world and the basic element of what we would generally regard as science .
Learning and understanding ideas and concepts is therefore necessary to study seriously and eventually to be a good scientist .

A further step is developing your own ideas and concepts on what you know empirically .
This shows that you not only understand the relationship of facts and what is behind them but that you are also able to be productive and creative in finding new explanations and forms of analysing something .
Although it is certainly not required to develop an own theory in order to be a good student , having individual ideas is fundamental for your personal development and an intellectual necessarity at any university .

So , I would say that the statement is correct although one should keep an important aspect in mind : in order to understand ideas and concepts you have to know the facts at first .
And this means that you really have to know as much as possible about a special topic because facts are the unavoidable basis of concepts and ideas or theories .
Lacking important information may not only result in complete disability to understand concepts but can also cause misinterpretations that change the meaning of an idea , theory or concept totally and thus lead the student into a completely wrong direction which might have serious consequences .
So , in the end , it is important to stress that learning facts is definitely necessary .
But they still are only the basis .
Real understanding of a topic also means that you have to understand the concepts and ideas behind the pure facts .
That is what makes ideas and theoretical approaches so important .
"
70,12015.txt,P7,DEU,medium,"I definitely do agree with the statement because of several reasons .

Firstly and most important , I suppose that learning just facts without understanding the idea or the concept behind , you do not have the context and the basis to keep single facts in mind for a long time .

In addition , knowing the ideas and concepts always enables you to learn the facts later , for example when you need them .

In generel , people do remember what they once unterstood but do forget what they just learned without understanding it .

On the other hand , it is sometimes easier for students to learn the facts , because they get easier and faster access to reading material and books than to lectures and learning events which might better explain the ideas and concept .

In the short term , it might also appear more effective to learn just the facts in order to get a proper preparation for tests , because it is often more efficient when tests just ask for the facts .

But in the long term , as I already said , it is much more effectiv to understand the concept which serves you as a valuable basis to put related knowlegde on .

Therefore , Proffessors , ought to attract students to attend the learnig events in order to get an overwiev of the topic and understanding the concept and backround .

From my own experience I know that I do not remember any facts of subjets , of which i did not understand the concept .
But in case I understood the idea and the context , I know where my notes are to get the demanded facts quickly .

Overall it becomes very clear that in the middle - and lorg term , understanding the concepts and ideas of a subject in order to learn effectively and keep things in mind , is much more effective than just learning the facts .

8160,1268792.txt,P6,SPA,high,"I do not think that the best way to travel is with a group led by a tour guide .
First , If you limit yourself to the movements and decision of one group , say of people from your own country , you may not be able to know the locals and learn from their worldviews and traditions .
How many time have you seen a packed group of tourists interacting only among themselves and thinking that the guide 's opinions and beliefs represent the opinion and feelings of all the community ?
When visiting another country or place , I like melting with the locals , meeting as many people as I can and learning directly from their everyday actitivies and their own ideas .
Second , you may think that tour guiding visits are more informative or convinient in terms of time and money .
However , truth is that many times guided-tours are more expensive and time consuming than individual , self-informed visits .
Tour guides in Costa Rica for example usually charge excessive amounts of money to tourists for activities that would not be so expensive if done alone or with the help of a local friend .
Depending on the site you are visiting , in a guided-tour you will only get the information that has been included in the guide 's `` menu '' and , sometimes , this information may not be as accurate as you think .
For examples , in Costa Rica many times tour guides are brought from a different place just because they know the language of the tourists or because they have more education than locals .
They were not born in the place or city where they work and , therefore , they frequently do not know all the particular details of the place or its hidden history .
Guided-tours are usually only offered in certain schedules that may not be the most suitable for your interests .
Besides , you may fall into the trap of overplanning your trip , and end up stressed by the pressures of getting up early to catch the shuttle or having to comply with time-limited breaks for breakfast , lunch or going to the bathroom .
Finally , in guided-tours you have to follow the pace of the group when walking around the halls of a museum or an old church .
If alone , you can stop whenever you want , skip what you considere unimportant or just going somewhere else .
Definitely , guided-tours and traveling in a group is not as fascinating as traveling on your own , having the time to interact with locals , taking certain risks that will definitely enrich your experience abroad and will give you enough material to entertain your friends and family back at home .

8989,1430295.txt,P8,KOR,medium,"I do n't agaree that successful people try new things or take risks .
They have already tried to get thier success hard than other people , therefore , they could get successful life or business .

Not trying anythings and staying in current situation is absolutely not What I mentioned .
We can try and change somethings with relitivites in the successful field .
Not too much strange .
For example , someone who excells in making pizza .
He has a successful career with his own pizza restaurant .
He can try new recipes of pizza or side dishes of food .
But he does not need to try new field of food such as chinese food , French food .
He should keep developing of pizza and relitives food , but not new genre of food .
After many times practicing , he might have been a good cook for pizza .
There are no reason that he should try different food .

When people try new things , it usually have less than 50 % of success .
Nobody garentees it .
I think that someone who already have a successful life , it is time to develope more sepecific .
It does not mean to try somethings new .

6925,1106796.txt,P2,TEL,medium,"The happiest period in one 's life is young age .
It is a period of learning , enjoyment , base for future life , healthier life .
So i feel that young people enjoy more than older people .

Firstly young age is the period where people learn a lot .
They learn about interaction with others .
They learn about various subjects , & of nature .
They even do specialisations in various fields which become profession to earn money .
This forms the base for the future life .
Because it is the period to earn money for future and for eenjoyment .
This is also period to learn other skills for relaxation as well as for entertainment .
It is a period of learning skills because they have good memory and intelligence .

Secondly , it is a period of enjoyment .
Because people can spend much time with friends , relatives , family members .
At this age people can also move freely to different placesin search of work , see different places , enjoy holidays .
They can even enjoy by reading books , playing with children where as older people cannot spend time with family members mostly because of their stay away from them due to studies or work .
Older people loss interest in things as they grow older so they do not enjoy every thing surrounding them .

Thirdly , young age is the healthy period in health point of view .
As older people face many problems of old age such as dementia - loss of memory , general weakness , and various other problems relating to old age .

Finally , i conclude that young people enjoy more than older people because of their intelligence , memory , interest , and lastly support of the health .

4378,758809.txt,P5,TEL,low,"I agree with this statement `` In twenty years ther will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' .
This might be due to increase in population , high traffic and hike in fuel costs .

In current scenario , petrolium products costs are increasing rapidly .
By comparing costs of the same for past 5 years , rates are increased almost double .
This will influence more than any other factor to people to opt for other means of transpotation .

And some people might get think of frequent traffic jams during peak office timings , and find other means of transportation .
From my practical experience i can strongly say that this is very serious problem to think off as I got late to my office , mainly for inportant presentations .

Other factor which we ca n't avoid is increasing in population and roads 'll get conjusted .
This case it will be difficult to find a place to construct new roads in main traffic areas .
Even it ll be little difficult to government to displace the people , who lived nearby main roads to some other place in case of widening of roads .

From other positive side , since all metro cities are opting for MTS ( mass transportation system ) , people can easily change their means of transportation andcan avoid having cars .
And other way to forget cars is by staying in a walkable distance to their working places and other important activity places .

As a conclusion by considering all the mentioned difficulties in current trafic problems and advantegaes in mentiond solutions to avoid traffic , cars may get reduce in next 20 yrs .

9533,1536901.txt,P8,SPA,high,"The belief that a life without risks is better is common among many people .
But is it true ?
I would like to start with an example , for it is always better to `` get the picture '' before hearing arguments on a topic .
Cristobal Colon discovered America .
Everybody knows that .
But would that have been possible without him taking the risk of navigating into unknown waters accompained with nothing but criminals ?
I do not think so .

So , everybody who believes that Colon was succesful should also think that to be succesful you have to try new things , to risk something .
If it is not so , that is why I have further arguments .

As a Business Administration student I have learnt that the essential aspect of having a productive and growing business is to make decisions knowing that the chance of losing is always present , but that the wish of improving should be stronger than this fear .
`` Use fear as a motor not as a break '' some say , correctly .
Life can be seen as a business , you always have to do something in order to achieve what you want , it is an exchange of services for utlities .
For this reason I believe the same rules , which have been precisely studied during these last years , could and should be applied to our everyday routine .

Lets examine the situation from another point of view .
Someone has achieved a state in his life , where he believes no more is to be improved .
This person has a plan for the rest of his life .
At the begining it will surely feel nice to have this kind of security and peace , and that is not negative .
But after a while , he will get bored , for the human is the kind of specie that must always do something different in order not to get frustrated .
If not , the work policies of the Industrial Revolution would still persist .
The thing is , that by the time this individual of the example realizes he is bored , he will have lost the confidence to try new things , to risk some of that security and will enter a great frustration , not likely to maintain him in a successful state .

Furthermore , society and its elements are not at all stable , it changes constantly , as do the necessities of the people .
In order to be succesful one has to be able to adapt fastly to these new demands , and in order to achieve that sacrifices must be done .

I conclusion , I believe that the statement that risks and new creations are basic elements of success are nothing but correct .
Remember the automobile or a more recent example , the Internet ?
Those are all inventions of peple who tried to do what noone else before them had , and insisted even though many thought of them as crazy .

4897,853515.txt,P3,FRA,medium,"I believe this statement is true , but i would rather blame the community or the society than the youth .

Our society have gone through lots of changes in the last century .
In the past , the society of the middle age was built around the community and the village and further the basic family , which is the father , the mother and the children .
There was no needs to leave the house , unless mariage , and the school was mostly for the wealthy .
This type of organisation made it easy , and essential , for the community and especially the youngest to work hand in hand for the community , for instance on the field , because the life of the all the community relied on the amount and the quality of crops .
And also because the yougest had no choice than to work for the community in order to securize their own existence .
The society of the 21st century is pretty much different from that picture .

The young from the age of 3 or 4 to the age of 22 or 23 has to go to school in order to learn a profession and find his place in the society .
As soon as you got a job , the security you were obtaining through the middle age community in the past , is all gained through your salary .
The today world has become very oriented on the person itself , and not so much on the community .
People raise their children alone , go to work and come back at evening and prepare for the same ritual the next day .
Commercials appearing all the time on television or radio send clear messages `` Goods for your personal needs '' as a person .
The sense of community has almost disappeared from the screen .

Another factor to the discharge of the youth of today , is the lack of time .
Talking about school or workplace , things have to be done more efficiently in a shorter period of time .
So it become more difficult for people to concentrate on the problems of the others .

That reaction is exactly the one of the youth of today , which should n't be blamed but the society we are living in .

As the understanding the ideas and concepts , he can face any consequences and the problems .
he can solve the problems through the idea and concept he has .
if he has to learn by the fact then he may not think as fast as if he knows the concepts .
he has to learn the ideas and concepts because he may not face every fact in his lifetime .
with the idea and concept he has can improve his knowledge .
he can apply this taughts to some new application .
where he has the chance to learn something new .
ideas and concepts are the facts of others so the can improve his knowledge about that fact and having idea and concept of others fact will improve the students knowledge .
lets us take an example of newtons theory , if you tell the stundent to finds the laws of newtons he may not find on his own .
because his ideas will not reach suddenly to that .
if he has idea and concept about the newtons theory then he can improve that theory on the other by applying it .

if the student learn something by the fact , he will sutre remember it and that will become an idea and concept to others .

511,93531.txt,P8,HIN,medium,"I agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well because successful people are full of confident that what ever field or work thier choose in that they can do well .
what i belive is the confident of being succesful is the half success and after that half path is left to success .
For example my father is a succesful busineesman and for increasing his businees he try out new thing and he did well because he know how to do well in new business .
For being successfull a person should hardworking and he must be devotational and obidient to his work .
I thing if a person is hard working a succes is not far away from him .
But sometime a some successful person afraid of doing new thing because of being unsuccessful .
the most success full person for example a famous industrialist of my country `` ambani '' he is the sucessfull industrialist of his time every one know him because he try to do new things and he know trying new things is not so easy a factar of risk is always exist .
As a success personality he pleased in doing new thing , that make him more poplar .
sucessful persons already know the key of success is hard work and their are mentally prepaired what can happen to them if their are not sucessfull but still their never afraid in doing new thing .
Ambani is actually a gold merchant after his success in this field he try out new thing put a oil refinary industry by selling all his gold business shop and finally he became sucessful and he did not stop here he is still trying new this , so in my veiw a succesful person try new thing rather than only doing what they already did .

3069,532097.txt,P8,FRA,high,"As a first comment , I wouls say that there are two ways of being successful after having taken risk .
The first one is when you are still alive after action and more wealthy than before , The second one when you killed yourself while taking a huge risk endangering a family or a whole community .
But this is more philosophy than real explanation ...
what is success ...

Generaly speaking , this is true that people who take risks are more successful than others .
This is right for many reasons .
First , they challenge their own mind , or what they have learned just because they dont feel confortable with regular rules .
In fact they cannot live with what has been given to them , they have to re-invent the wheel or try something else like Bill Gates did in his garage .
Because they feel free in their head , they find new solutions and new ideas that save money or facilitate once life with products or ideas that every one will buy or follow .
Very often they invest they own money or borrow a big amout of money .
But money doesn t make all the difference .
This is because they have taken this risk with a huge faith in their project that they are successful .
They never stopped even if they failed once .

In other cases they put their own life in danger and one of the best example could be what the Appolo 13 team has achieved .
The fact of only doing things that are very wee known and established is always leading to the end of an era or a civilisation and everybody knows this and this is why the populations recognize easily their heros that are taking risks .

We are used to say they take risk but in fact in many case they have nothing to loose or they dont even see the risk they are taking just because this is simply their own way of living .

I agree that it is the best way to travel .
Travel is in a group led by a tour guide can help us to solve the many kinds of anxieties that other kind of travel cannot .
I will show the merits of travel in a group with a tour guide .

First , travel in a group with a guide can reduce time waste .
If we travel without guide , we may wandering so many times because we do n't have a lot of knowledge that where is important place and what we have to see .
So guide can help us to travel around important place .

Second , travel in a group with a guide can reduce money waste .
If we travel without guide , we must pay a lot of money because we do n't know how much those is .
while travel with a guide , we do n't worry about that .
Almost all of the tour guides already contracted with restaurants , shopping malls and many places .
So , we can uses all kind of things in travel unexpensively by giving cheaper money to guide .

Third , we do n't worry about danger by traveling in a group with a tour guide .
If we travel to strange place alone or travel with some people , we cannot relax .
We may put in trouble with other people because of cultural differences and we may be terrible hurted by strange animals .
So travel in a group with a guide can reduce our anxiety .

Therefore , Travel in a group with a tour guide has many mefits that other kind of travel does not have .
I agree with the idea that The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because of upper reasons .
"
6331,1053319.txt,P3,DEU,high,"Unfortunately I have to agree with the statement that nowadays young people do not invest enough time to help their communities .
In my opinion a possible reason for this development might be the lack of a strong incentive for the young people to spend their precious free time on helping the community instead of maybe hanging out with their friends , playing video games etc .
As especially cities grow to become more and more anonymous , young people do not see the reward of their work in the community as they would in a smaller one where everyone knows each other and the youth would get more appreciation for their voluntary work .
This is , of course , a misconception , because volunteering for a good cause is appreciated in both environments , it just may be not as obviously to the young people .
So the question is : What do the youth do with the time that they once spend on helping their communities ?

They spend it on activities that they simply find more pleasurable .
In fact , this is a trend that we can detect in all layers of society and in all ages , we do not need to search for this phenomenon among young people only .
Of course , it is more fun going to the cinema than helping elderly members of the community .
So what we need is incentives .
We could get incentives from the parents , helping their kids realize at a young age that it is important to take responsibility and help out in the community at least every once in a while , depending on the child .
Small activities done for the community may be more important and more valued than one might think and every kind of work is strongly welcomed and appreciated .

The community itself must have a strong core in order to create networks and to attract the young people through for example specific institutions and activities only for the young .
I say this , because I believe that only if the zoung people can identify themselves with their community , at least to a certain extent , will they be willing to become an active member and help by investing a bit of the work as well .
"
3228,559741.txt,P3,ZHO,medium,"Nowadays , young people would not like to give their time to helping their communities .
There are several reasons to cause this problem .
In my opinion , most of the young people are egoist .
In their mind , they are not responsible to do something to helping their communities .
Their only responsibility is to helping their own house .
Besides that , they also think about that they can spend money to hire some guards or cleaners to keep the community safe and clean .
For example , my friend , Jean every month her family pay the maintanance fee to the maintanance department .
She had never attend any meeting in her community .
As I asked her why she did not attend the meeting , she answered me that she had paid the money and she was very busy to maintance her own house .

Secondly , the young people nowadays spend most of their time in studying .
It is because our parents always told us that if we got good result , then we would have a great future also .
Most of our parents would like us to concentrate in our studying and disagree us to join extra activities to waste time .
For example , I am a person who like to join the community activity .
Once day , my mother told me that she is not willing to see me spend my time in those activities .
It is because she think if I spend the time to join activities to studying , my result would be better .
However she does not like me to join the activities , but I still attend those activities because I can learn more .

Finally , some young people think that helping their communities are boring job .
They would prefer to playing online games and watching television programme at home or chatting with friends are more atrractive .
Some young girls always say that it was very tired to do the job in their communities , but I think they would not say that shopping in the shopping complex is also very tired .
For example , my brother is a very lazy person .
As we ask him to do anything , he will refuse us and sleep on the sofa .
Sometime as his friends ask him to go to cyber cafe playing online game , he will wake up immediately .
It is because the communities job cannot attract him .

As my conclusion , young people do n't like to spend their time to helping their communities because they are egoism , they are busy in their studying and the communities jobs are not attractive .

5346,932106.txt,P6,ZHO,high,"It 's the travel time , do you prefer travel alone or with a group led by a tour guide ?
A good question , I would not hesitate to go with a group led by a tour guide .

There are too many advantages to travel with the group led by a tours guide .
First , the efficiency issue .
We are busying on studying , working or anyother things , or you even can not imagine how we can spare ten or more minutes to google all the travel information and accomadation .
Preparation of travel is a time-consuming process , and it may get you stressed out when there 's no hotel room or air ticket available on a particular day .
If it 's with a group led by a tour guide , no worries , they arrange every single detail for you in advance .
So they reduce your effort and save your energy .

Second , the safety issue .
If we travel alone , we may choose driving for sightseeing among nearby place .
As we know , people are fatigue when they travel around , in the meantime , their focus on driving is distracted by views or landscapes outside of the car window .
Car accident probability during travel time ranks the top among other accidents situation according to our national survey .
I was involved in the exactly same situation once when I drived with my boyfriend , that 's a nightmare , you may never want to experience .

Third , the travel perception issue .
It 's no doubt that tour guides are real experts for explaination of tour sites .
As we may experienced , you are more exposed to the thorough information about specific place than you travel alone .
In addition , the tour guides are more informed about regulations or price change for relative sighseeing issue , therefore we can avoid some useless rush .
That 's why the tourist industry keep booming these years in our city for these 4 consecutive years .

Nevertheless , we embrace all intrinsic advantages of traveling with group led by tour guide , we may still have some pity for its inconvenience and comfortable concern .
We are not allowed to go wherever we feel like to go since it 's hard for tour guide to organize a huge group , we follow tour guide 's preference other than our owns .
Also , sitting in a tour bus with 40 people interrupted by any of their snoring or other noise seems not as enjoyable as driving my own car with my friends .

Even so , I still would jump up to choose travel with a group led by a tour guide if I were given a chance to select comparing with travel alone , and it 's obvious advantages outweigh its shortcomings , Travel with the group led by a tour guide can also foster our networking opportunity during the trip and may learn across culture .
What a good chance to know people beyond the above attractive conditions !

10483,1710649.txt,P5,DEU,high,"Nowadays nearly all of today 's cars depend on petrol , either in form of gasoline or diesel , in order to run .
Because worldwide petrol ressources are limited , one could easily assume that in the long run , for example in twenty years , gas will be so expensive that many people can not afford it anymore , thus there will be fewer cars in use in total .

But on the other hand gas prices , especially in Europe , nearly doubled within the last five years and nothing happened .
Customers are getting angry at polititians and the petrol industry , but commute to work by car nevertheless .
Also the industrial demand in transport is steadily increasing due to globalisation .
Packages and goods get delivered all over the world and one of the cheapest ways to do that still is by trucks on the road .
Furthermore huge new markets for automobiles , like China or India are still on the rise .

Concerning the petrol problem there is also hope in technical development such as electric drives for cars and trucks or solar technique .
Even though there are still a couple of problems to solve these new techniques may one day , lead to much more economic cars or maybe even total independence of the world 's petrol ressources .
That could weaken one of the most powerful arguments not to drive cars with combustion engines : the limited petrol ressources .

Personally , I believe that in twenty years there will be even more cars worldwide .
I 'm sure that the technical evolution will provide a good environmental friendly alternative to today 's gasoline driven cars .
Last but not least , people simply love the convenience of their very own personal vehicle .

10232,1664318.txt,P1,SPA,medium,"I prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects in order to can obtain more information and many topics for the future profesional development .

When a student starts the university is vey young and he or she only has the knowledge given by the high school .
The university permits to have a diverse capacity and people can learn about many topics .
Subjects like a science , economics , mathematics , account , physics , literature and arts , for example , permit the student can to have more culture and to select appropiate what student want to be in a future .
While a student studies a bachelor , he ( or she ) is between 17 and 22 years old .
He ( or she ) is so young to be clear what subject want to study in order to be a profesional .
I remember when I started the university , I wanted to study computer science but never I had touched a computer in my life ( I was 16 years old ) .

After , when people finish the bachelor and have experience in a job , person can to study specific subject that will permite to improve his ( her ) profesional skill .
For example , a mathematician can specialize in a branch that he or she is interested .
Today there is a lot of mathematic 's branch that can to study in order to find an interested job .
Again , I am going to give a personal example .
My bachelor is Mathematics .
I had been working many years in some areas in a bussiness and finally , I found a branch that I want to focus .
This branch is Financial Risk Management .

Another point is the globalization .
It is important to know about different topics because we live a period where the communication around the world is essential .
New profesional have to know about what still hapenned and they will learn their first steps taking a knowledge of many academic subjects .

In order to conclude this essay , I would prefer that peolpe have broad knowledge of many subjects because they will be more sure that they want to be in the profesional life .

6441,1063514.txt,P5,ZHO,medium,"I agree with this statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Here are my reasons : More and more people concern about the polluted problem of environment , and not only government decides to pass bills that can protect our nature environment , but also people reduce the damage to our environment .
And cars are one of vital damage to these pollution , because they release carbon dioxide .
If people reduce to drive cars by themselves , instead , use the mass transportation , the amount of carbon dioxide , which is a vital reseason that cause pollutions can be eliminated .
So I think cars will be fewer than today .

Second , cities are developed grauatedly , more and more cities will have their mass transportation , such as MRT , trains , or buses .
These useful development can provide a more ecnomical way to transport for citizens .
In order to save money and priceless time , people will choose to use mass transportation rather than drive cars by themselves .
For example , although many teachers of mine have their own cars , but they only drive cars by themselves in rainy days .
Because the MRT in our city provides a cheaper and comfortable journey for us .
And they do n't need to drive .

In addition , the expenditure to maintain a car is very big .
For example , the expenditure of gasoline , the tax of cars , etc .
This huge expenditure would effect the willing of people having a car .

Finally , crowed traffic situation would also make people do not want drive car by themselves .
And there is still a big problem to drivers : finding a parking space is extremely hard .

To sum up , the idea of environmental protection , more conveinent mass transportation , the expenditure of having a car , to avoid stuck in a traffic jam , worry about how to find a parking space on time , all of these considerations would make fewer and fewer people to plan to have their own cars .

11697,1926423.txt,P7,ARA,high,"I agree with the statement `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . ''
Regardless of the field that a student is enrolled in , the main purpose behind the academic experience is for students to learn .
Learning comes through understanding logically the laws and concepts associated with any topic .
The difference between an idea and a fact is that ideas have to be explained , illustrated and understood .
Facts on the other hand have to be accepted because regardless of a person 's opinion , a fact is a real solid statement .
However , helping the student understand ideas and laws will make the acceptance and endoulgment of facts a much easier process .
For example , when learning about human existance , it is a common well acknowledged fact that death is the end of any human .
To help accept this fact , students learn from spirtual , religious and philisophical teachings the different explinations of creation , the reason behind life , the purpose of existance and the concept of after life .
Once a student truly understands these ideas and concepts and develops an explenation that meets his vision in life , it becomes much easier for him to accept the different facts related to human existance .
Nonetheless , stating that the understanding ideas is more important than learning facts in not to take away from the importance of learning different facts .
It is simply an arrangement of priorities .

A developed understanding of ideas and concepts will help in accepting facts , and once those facts are accepted individuals start to develope opinions related to those facts .
That is why it is highly important to learn different facts since it increases the student 's level of knowledge and awarness about the studied topic and helps in shaping his individuality be developing his personal opinions .

1083,178084.txt,P8,JPN,medium,"Successuful People

Everyone wants to be successful and gets wealth ; however , being successuful is not easy thing .
Successful people would effort to develop their career skills when they are young , and also they would still push themselves to focus on doing important things for them .
There are two kinds of way to be successful people : trying new things and taking risks .

Not evryone can try new things , because they would get nervous or be scared to start new things .
Successful people are not afraid to try new things , sometime they even enjoy to do them .
For instance , successful people learn another language , study hard what he / she wants to be for the future , and try to make new friends who are international students .
Because they knew that it is important to know about worldwide information .

However , people would be successful if they only try new things , because if people take risks that only doing what they already know , they will be more confident .
It will lead you to be successful .
For example , they live in foreign country to study for the future .
Of course they would not know yet how to deal with foreign people , because of language .
So even though a person knows that studying in foreign country is difficult , if the person goes to abroad to study , the exprimence leads the person to be successful .

Therefore , trying new thing and taking risks make people to be successful .

1831,316246.txt,P8,ITA,high,"People react to everyday life in different ways .
There are some human beings who prefer to follow the ` known way ' in each of the activities they perform .
There are some others who always prefer to experience new things and new , probably risky , ways of reacting to problems or stimula from the outside .
I firmly believe that these are the people who often demonstrate to be the most succesful in their lives .

Taking risks and exploiting new solutions are universally recognised as the characteristics of succesful leaders .
Business world is full of examples of people who took risks and had great success .
CEOs of the most succesful companies in most of the cases are succesful themselves because they decided not to follow their sheer experience , but to take risks .
Mr Jobs from Apple Co , for example , put most of the resources of R & D department of his company to exploit a new area of business , the MP3 one , when its company was facing a serious crisis .
His decisions were the right ones .
History has proved how the perceptions he had about the potentialities of that NEW product were right .

However , the business field is not the only one where people proved to be succesful by trying new things .
When talking about Italian politics in the early eighteenth century it always appears that the most commonly cited name is the one of Marco Rossi .
This famous politician was considered a fool when he proposed , first in the country , to pass an act to consider to give also to women the right to vote .
He took the political risks of his proposal , which was totally new for that period .
After that he had worldwide approval and success , just beacuse he took the risk of a new action .

Anyway not only famous people can be taken as examples .
In everyday life there is plenty of normal people that are considered succesful by the ones who know them because they decided to experiment .
For example in a small village the first person who moves away to another area or even country is often considered as a hero for his village fellows .
As before , he took the risk and tried new things ( i .
d : moving ) .

This makes the idea of experiencing new routes and things stronger into my mind .
Being succesful is hard but it is proved that taking reasonable risks and following unexperienced territories helps .
This happens not just in famous human beings ' lives , but also to normal people .

9316,1490058.txt,P4,ITA,medium,"For what concerns my point of view , nowadays advertisment is used to convince people buying products that are often of lower quality than they seem on the tv spots or on the advertising spaces .

I think most of the companies are only interested in earning as much money as possible .
Their policies don-t always care about ethic and moral principles .
This attitude is reflected in the way they act when advertise their products .
They want to caught the eye of the consumers with bright colors , wanderful images of idyllic places , beautiful women , music and similar things .
They work hard , thinking about what attracts the majority of the people , what are the desires and the dreams that their target customer has .
But on the other side they do not invest enaugh money and time to improve the quality of the goods .

I think every customer at least once experienced the misleading informations advertising conveys .
When I was a little child I always want my parents to buy things I saw in the television spots .
For instance , when I was six I was amazed by the spot of a doll that could speak with children .
I thought that she was able to answer every question I may ask to her .
But when I went to the toys shop and I tryed it I was really sad in understanding her abilities were only crying and saying she was hungry , thirsty and sleepy .

Now I-m no more a child but often products that attracts me with advertising don-t satisfy me at all .

I think that governments should be more severe with companies , checking if the standard of goods really meet the promises of the spots .
The companies can-t be free of telling lies to the customer , beside this he must = e protected by the law .
